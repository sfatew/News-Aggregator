Satoshi Nakamoto launched\u2026","date":"Dec 29, 2023","post_content":"This is a \u201Cblast from the past\u201D article, which I think is appropriate, given that the New Year is nearly upon us. Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, the first ever blockchain, on January 3rd, 2009. And so we are almost upon the 15th anniversary of the occasion.Blockchains use wallets as their main user interface, and over the last decade and a half, wallets and the management of private keys have developed significantly. For this article, written with the help of the engineers over at Resonance Security, I go through some of the problems experienced in the past by developers and users of blockchain wallets.This should give you a clearer understanding as to why wallets are so important, and why they are such a difficult technology to provide securely and reliably.Satoshi\u2019s first release included both the software for running a blockchain node and a blockchain wallet. Wallet software manages the private keys that are used by those owning assets on a blockchain to authorize transactions. These private keys derive the public blockchain addresses that hold the digital assets and are used to digitally sign the approvals for the transactions involving those assets.Blockchains use asymmetric key cryptography; typically ECDSA, and that means that to generate a private key you need to select a random 256-bit number (a number between 1 and about 1.157 * 10\u2077\u2077, which is approximately 1 followed by seventy-seven zeroes, or a hundred quattuorvigintillion).It turns out that a) selecting a truly random un-guessable 256-bit number is rather hard, and b) looking after that number without losing it or allowing someone else to access and steal it is even harder.The first blockchain wallet mentioned above is sometimes referred to as the Satoshi client. In the early days, the Satoshi client generated private keys randomly using a C++ random number generator and stored them in a file called wallet.dat.Initially, the file was unencrypted, which meant that once bitcoin began to have a dollar value, hackers started trying to hack into networked computers running the client to steal a copy of the wallet.dat file and hence the crypto stored in the derived bitcoin addresses.Laterwallet.dat was encrypted with a random master key, which was itself encrypted with a password called a wallet passphrase. Sometimes users selected wallet passphrases that were too simple and could be guessed by trial and error over time.People still occasionally find old installations of the early Bitcoin software on their decommissioned computers and hard drives, with wallet.dat files storing keys providing access to old stashes of bitcoin. If the files are early enough to be unencrypted, or the original owner can remember the passphrase, this can lead to an unexpected crypto-windfall.Around 2013 or so, some people came up with an idea that initially seemed brilliant \u2014 create a password or a passphrase, and hash it with the SHA256 cryptographic hash function to obtain a 256-bit number that could be used as a private key. That way, you can carry your bitcoin around in your head!There are two problems with this approach. The first is that people are not good at remembering things over long periods of time. A passphrase may seem memorable today, but a year or a decade from now \u2026 not so much.The second is that humans are not good at coming up with truly random passwords, and so many brainwallets turned out to be guessable. For example, someone thought that a line from the Simpsons season 5, episode 7 would make a good passphrase: \u201CYou don\u2019t win friends with salad!\u201D, using it to generate the public address 15gCfQVJ68vyUVdb6e3VDU4iTkTC3HtLQ2This was guessed by someone, who drained the three bitcoin it was holding at the time. Fortunately, these were subsequently returned, and the original owner learned a lesson that could have cost them tens or hundreds of bitcoins.It does not matter how careful you are with your wallet, keeping it offline and storing your seed phrase in a safe in the back of a bank vault, if the method used to generate the private keys was not truly random in the first place.This is a recurring problem in computer programming. Computers do not do random very well \u2014 they are deterministic machines. In most cases, for example, if you are writing a game with enemies spawning randomly, using a fast pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is good enough.But PRNGs generate the same sequence of \u201Crandom\u201D numbers on any computer, provided you kick off the process with the same seed value, and developers often use the current time as the PRNG seed value.No one is going to put time and effort into determining exactly where a bunch of goblins or zombies are going to appear in a computer game, but if the random numbers are used to generate blockchain addresses, and those blockchain addresses are holding cryptocurrency, then it makes sense to try a bunch of seed inputs to see if they generate value-holding addresses.It turned out that a wallet provider called Cakewallet made exactly this mistake in their code. Given that the first Cakewallet release was in 2018, and the flaw wasn\u2019t discovered until 2021, that left a three-year window of vulnerable wallet addresses.And three years is only 95 million seconds. All those wallet addresses could therefore be brute forced with less than 100 million tries, which is not an especially large number if you\u2019re running your cracking software offline and have a decent computer and a few months.When given too much responsibility, the instinctive approach taken by many is to find someone to act as a parent and take on the duties and liabilities. Hence custodial wallets. Transfer your assets to a company or a person, and have them handle the headache of securing the wallets, remembering the passwords, and preventing hackers.The theory is that an organization dedicated to safeguarding bitcoin and other digital assets has efficiencies of scale, and can hire a gamut of security consultants, cryptography software developers, and experienced network engineers to make sure everything runs smoothly.In practice, there are plenty of examples of custodial wallets failing, large and small. Two of the most famous are:The problem with custodianship is that there is no guarantee the custodian is any more competent than you are and may be a criminal to boot. Furthermore, cryptocurrency has no Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guaranteeing your assets against theft or loss. What\u2019s more, a centralized custodian makes a rich single target for hacker groups.How about cutting out custodians, or holding on to your own assets, and using a smart contract? That\u2019s exactly what the Parity wallet smart contract library on Ethereum was designed for. The assets are transferred to the wallet smart contract using the library, and multiple authorization signatures are required to move the assets back out of the wallet later on.This multisig approach seemed like a good one (and indeed it is): require several people to sign off, for example, three out of six board members. Then if one or two of them lose their passphrase due to phishing or oversight, or are corrupt embezzlers, the assets are still safe.Unfortunately, the Parity wallet library contained a bug. When it was deployed (or rather, re-deployed to fix another bug), back in 2017, the wallet library wasn\u2019t initialized to have an owner. A \u201Ckill\u201D function was included in the code, which could be called by the owner of the contract. Someone going by the handle of devops199 first called the initialization function to take ownership of the library and then called the kill function, freezing all the funds being held by multiple multisig wallets using the Parity wallet library.The total lost? 513,743 ETH, or about 1.2 billion US dollars in today\u2019s prices.Looking after your crypto-assets seems like a game of \u201Chead you lose, tails the hackers win.\u201D It\u2019s hard to look after them yourself and even harder to let someone else do it for you.The fact remains that crypto is still in the wilderness. You have to decide \u2014 do I go with a tour guide (and how can I assess how competent they are), or do I learn survival skills and rely on myself. Until the blockchain space becomes a park, that is the way it will be.Till then, protecting yourself and your assets involves work:And now all that remains is for me and Resonance Security to wish you a prosperous, but above all, a safe New Year.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*9yvFlEcMLVJQ0bXIMDLHNg.jpeg","author":"Keir Finlow-Bates","title":"In Search of Lost Keys","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@kf106\/in-search-of-lost-keys-69f624c0c28e","tags":[]},{"summary":"The Babylon team will sunset the current Bitcoin staking testnet at 12pm UTC, 16\/05\/2024 to clear the ground for the next testnet.

Within 48 hours of launching, it attracted over 100K pioneer stakers. During its operation, the team has collected a lot of constructive feedback and suggestions from the community. The team has also identified several areas for improvements. All of them are invaluable to the development of the next testnet. We highly appreciate the participation and contributions from the community.Since this testnet has fulfilled its purpose, to clear the ground for the next one, we have decided to sunset it in two weeks. All operations will be fully functional until then, including staking, unbonding, and withdrawal of the Signet BTC.The next testnet will still use Bitcoin Signet, the most reliable Bitcoin test network. So, if you are interested in trying out the next testnet, you could consider unbonding and withdrawing your Signet BTC from the current testnet (Babylon \u2014 Staking Dashboard). We will also host a BTC Signet faucet on Discord. More details about the next testnet will be released later.Finally, we would like to emphasize that Signet BTC is only a simulated BTC for testing that can be used only for the Bitcoin Signet test network.

We\u2019re still doing some last minute optimisations and tweaks, but everything is ready.Pretty much everything that has been previously outlined for Phase 1:2. Anonymity \u2014 no mandatory email address or names for end-users during registration. No logging \u2014 unless explicitly enabled by you, the user, for purposes of, for example, resolving issues and debugging. Logs are transitory and wiped when logging is disabled and no longer required.3. Crypto payments with special offers and bonuses for FUND paymentsPerfection. Whilst we have endeavoured to find\/fix bugs and optimise the platform, it\u2019s still a beta, so there will be issues that were not picked up during our smaller scale alpha testing. Bugs are an inevitability with software, and the wider scale public beta will help us catch and kill anything we missed, overlooked or were not even aware of during alpha testing. This is, of course, all a part of a large scale changes required as we move into Phase 2.Since this is a beta, we will be offering bug bounties. Details to follow.In parallel with bug fixing and optimising Phase 1 during the public beta, we will soon be starting planning and development for UNoDE Phase 2 \u2014 beginning the SaaS chapter of UNoDE.With Phase 2, we aim to develop tools to allow potential operators to spin up their own RPC infrastructure and join the UNoDE family. Along with revenue sharing, this will help propel UNoDE into becoming a truly decentralised NaaS platform unlike any existing options today.Phase 2 of the UNoDE project aims to focus on implementing the SaaS (software as a service) aspect, in order to provide a decentralised network of NaaS RPC nodes.UNoDE aims to offer a suite of scripts and tools allowing potential third party UNoDE Operators to deploy their own RPC nodes and connect them to the UNoDE API.The UNoDE backend will maintain a list of \u201Chealthy\u201D third party nodes, allowing the end-user API to route requests to these nodes. We aim to have these requests be load balanced, and also routed based on IP geo-location to reduce potential network latency incurred by third party nodes being situated in a different physical location.The UNoDE backend also aims to maintain a history of the number of requests successfully routed to and served by third party nodes, so that some of the revenue earned from UNoDE subscriptions can be shared with third party UNoDE Operators.What does all this mean? For the vast majority of end-users (developers, traders etc.), this should be a seamless implementation, and no changes should be required on their part. Existing API keys will remain the same, so the transition should be smooth.For potential Node Operators, there will be some new sections in the UNoDE UI, allowing the generation of a new API key which is used specifically for registering their RPC nodes to the UNoDE network. Additionally, Node Operators should have access to a new area of the UI giving an overview of their nodes and data such as health status, number of requests served, and their current share of revenue, history etc.We will be reaching out to our existing alpha testers during Phase 2 development, and will also eventually open up registration for new alpha testers.True network decentralisation \u2014 including revenue sharing, and sustained growth together \u2014 has been the bastion pillar of Unification and will continue to a much deeper chapter as we expand our development into the next phase of UNoDE. We look forward to having you join us as users, supporters, developers & operators into the next chapter.GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/unification-comTelegram: https:\/\/t.me\/unificationfoundationDiscord: https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/725618617525207042Website: https:\/\/www.unification.com","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*Wygz1UesvJUpA66NBzzfOQ.png","author":"Codegnosis","title":"UNoDE Public Beta & Beyond","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/unificationfoundation\/unode-public-beta-beyond-56fbc071a2f3","tags":["Unode","Unification","Fund","Blockchain","Privacy"]},{"summary":"Published December 19, and clocking in at 193 pages (a 23% increase from 2023\u2019s Theses), Messari\u2019s \u201CCrypto Theses 2024\u201D is (IMHO) the\u2026","date":"Jan 1, 2024","post_content":"Published December 19, and clocking in at 193 pages (a 23% increase from 2023\u2019s Theses), Messari\u2019s \u201CCrypto Theses 2024\u201D is (IMHO) the industry\u2019s most insightful overview of the crypto ecosystem, and a must-read for every crypto enthusiast. TL;DR \u201CCrypto remains inevitable\u201D.The report is authored by Ryan Selkis, Co-Founder and CEO of web3 data provider and research powerhouse Messari, While Ryan was supported by the accomplished Messari research team, the report is written in the first person by Selkis. I\u2019ve been a Selkis fanboy since Jan. 2020 when he spoke at CryptoMondays NYC and mesmerized us with his discussion of his Crypto Theses 2020 and tales of breaking the Mt. Gox hack in 2014. I also believe that Messari Pro, a \u201Cone-stop shop for all your crypto data and research needs\u201D, is an essential tool for any serious crypto investor.The report provides a comprehensive state-of-the-state of crypto coupled with thought provoking predictions about 2024 and beyond. Each chapter is overflowing with insight:Given the length, I broke this post in to two pieces, each covering five chapters. I write this every year to force myself to read the entire Theses, go down rabbit holes, and LEARN. But, as educational as the report is, few will read it\u2019s entirety. So below are my most intriguing highlights in each of the first five entertaining and sagacious chapters of this prodigious report.In the same way that crypto is inevitable, so is AI. And the two, in combination, will prove world changing, providing solutions problems vexxing humanity.In an age of infinite deep fakes, crypto tech will provide \u201Cmathematically guaranteed provenance\u201D via \u201Ctimestamping and verifying devices and data\u201D. Generative DDOS attacks can be muted via \u201C.. \u201Dthe fees required by public blockchains\u201D. Crypto tech is the solution for a world where AI is generating trillions (?) of micro-payments a day.Video of a CryptoMondays Palo Alto I hosted in October on the intersection of AI & Web3 is a great primer on te topic:Also, shoutout to Messari for popularizing DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) as a moniker last year. Nomenclature is important!Cathie Wood is the epic Founder, in 2014, of ARK Invest ($20B+ AUM), the first institutional fund to invest in Bitcoin (via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust). While Ark invests in a broad range of innovation sectors, Cathie\u2019s thought leadership and bullish stance on crypto has been unwavering for years. Shortly after I saw the crypto light on 6\/29\/17, I sought out Cathie as she was the smartest institutional investor on bitcoin, and I wanted to learn. Cathie couldn\u2019t have been nicer and more giving of her time.Now, ARK is poised to be the first Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC given the January 10 deadline by which \u201C\u2026 regulators must either reject or approve her company\u2019s ETF.\u201DAmazingly, ARK open sources their research, which includes an incredible YouTube channel (544,000 subscribers):Cathie also hosts legendary Twitter Spaces:I\u2019m a fan boy, and honored to be one of just 389 people Cathie follows on X.This is a NEW section to enable Ryan \u201C\u2026 to share the killer product experiences that I had this year\u201D. I learned a lot in this section. I had never even heard of \u201CProject Guardian\u201D, the tokenization joint venture between JP Morgan and Apollo, among others.I think of the products Ryan highlighted, the most impactful one, to date, is \u201CUSDT (Tether) on Tron\u201D, because, as Ryan put it, USDT on Tron is \u201C\u2026. crypto\u2019s first truly globally important app\u201D.Tether has long been the main settlement currency for crypto exchanges outside the U.S.. But today, per Tether CEO, Paolo Ardoino, \u201C\u2026 40% of USDT demand was now coming from store of value and payment use cases, particularly in developing countries\u201D. As the use cases expanded, so has Tether\u2019s dominance of the stablecoin market, which now stands at 70%:I think of Tron as the AOL of crypto in Asia. Just like AOL wasn\u2019t the internet, but it made accessing the internet easier. And while Ethereum is the leading blockchain in terms of total stablecoin marketcap on chain, it\u2019s not surprising that Tron is a dominant second:In fact, Tron has 26X more stablecoin assets onchain than Solana.Tron transactions are largely in Asia for gaming and gambling apps. Asians users prefer Tron over Ethereum because it\u2019s cheaper, faster, and better optimized for use in Asia. That\u2019s why Tron processes more transactions at a fraction of the fees:This was another super dense chapter. I would have chosen USDT if I hadn\u2019t already gone in depth on USDT in #3. I\u2019m a huge fan of FRAX, the algorithmic stablecoin. And like many, privacy is a focus, and I\u2019ve been intirgued with Privacy Pools, an innovative, regualtory compliant, Tornado-like, privacy solution proposed by Ameen Solemani and Vitalik:But I chose CBDCs because, as opposed to Ryan, I think they\u2019re going to be a big thing, sooner rather than later. I\u2019m less concerned than Ryan about the dystopian possibilities of CBDCs because we already have dystopian financial surveillance. It could get worse, but the upside if CBDCs onboard billions of people to digital currencies, outweighs the downside risk.As Ryan an highlights, most CBDC pilots have been \u201Cwholesale\u201D CBDCs, involving transactions between financial institutions. Ryan doesn\u2019t think retail CBDC will be relevant \u201C\u2026 anywhere before 2030\u201D, even though he highlights numerous CBDC trials underway. Even Ryan thinks China\u2019s e-CNY is one to watch given it\u2019s scale, having processed over $250B of transactions across 120 million wallets created since 2020. CBDC pilots Ryan highlighted coming 2024 CBDC pilots from the Bank for International Settlements, the Bank of Korea and Russia. But the CBDC tracker below, via the Atlantic Council, reveals that CBDCs have been launched in 11 countries with another 21 either running pilots or planning one in 2024. In total, 90% of countries are exploring, developing or implementing CBDCs:Even Ripple got into CBDCs in May via the launch of a CBDC platform by forking it\u2019s XRP Ledger. The Ripple CBDC Platform \u201Coffers a comprehensive platform for minting, managing, transacting, and destroying CBDCs and stablecoins\u201D.I\u2019m in crypto because I think our fiscal systems are broken, beyond repair. I\u2019m here because we finally have decentralized financial tools that enable us to \u201Cexit the system\u201D if we choose.I joke that I want to think about the regulators as much as the regulators think about me. Now, that said, I appreciate that the more favorable the regulations are, the better. I applaud and support the Herculean efforts made by CoinCenter and other industry lobby groups in D.C.. But Google and Facebook aren\u2019t allowed in China, and they\u2019re still doing great. As Ryan says, crypto is inevitable. And I think the best way to get favorable U.S. crypto regulations is to build great products that people want because it makes their life better. The more successful we are, the more jobs we have the potential to create, the more D.C. will embrace us. I believe time spent building has a far higher ROI for the industry than time spent lobbying.While much of this section is a lesson in civics, I appreciate Ryans wit:As Ryan highlights, the government lied about the failures of SVB and Signature Bank earlier this year. It\u2019s now been well documented the 2023 bank insolvencies were greatly exacerbated by the regulators\u2019 implementation of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. We now know there was a \u201C\u2026 multi-step, multi-month, multi-agency effort to de-bank major crypto platforms from Silvergate, SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank\u201D.Following the collapse of SVB I wrote a post \u201CThe One Great Thing To Come Out Of The Tragic Collapse of SVB\u201D where I posited that many wealthy people in Silicon Valley just learned :It makes so much sense. But like most things in life, most humans have to learn things the hard way.It\u2019s not a coincidence that Bitcoin was up 50% the month following the collapse of SVB!Ryan highlighted an insightful talk I saw this year on The Swamp in D.C., Bill Gurley\u2019s epic take on regulatory capture at \u201CThe All In Summit\u201D:While Ryan believes \u201CWe can\u2019t walk away from all \u201Cengagement\u201D in DC when many leaders are ready to legislate punitively on our industry\u201D, I believe \u201CThe Way To Get Better U.S. Crypto Regs Is To Leave The U.S.\u201D.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Stay tuned for Part 2 to be published imminently.Here are five other insightful outlooks for crypto 2024:4. 2024 Blockchain Predictions \u2014 From crypto fund-of-fund Blockchain Coinvestors (where I\u2019m a Partner)5. 10 Crypto Predictions for 2024 \u2014 From crypto asset manager BitwiseClick here to subscribe to our crypto newsletter.

While this type of phishing method has been known for some time, the magnitude of the losses in this incident was nonetheless shocking. This article will analyze the key aspects of the same-beginning-and-end-digits address phishing attack, track the flow of the funds, profile the hacker, and offer recommendations for preventing such phishing incidents.Key Points of the Attack1. Generating Phishing Addresses: The hacker preemptively generated a large number of phishing addresses. By deploying batch programs in a distributed manner and monitoring on-chain user activities, they launched a phishing attack using addresses that matched the victim\u2019s intended transfer address in the first 4 and the last 6 digits (after removing the \u201C0x\u201D).2. Following Transactions: After the user initiated a transfer, the hacker immediately used the generated phishing address to follow with a transaction (sending 0 ETH to the user\u2019s address) approximately 3 minutes later. This transaction then appeared in the user\u2019s transaction history.3. Cast The Bait: Users often copy the most recent transaction details from their wallet\u2019s history. Seeing the follow-up phishing transaction and not thoroughly checking the address copied, the victim mistakenly sent 1155 WBTC to the phishing address!Using the on-chain tracking tool MistTrack, it was discovered that the hacker had exchanged the 1155 WBTC for 22955 ETH and transferred them to the following 10 addresses:On May 7, the hacker began moving the ETH from these 10 addresses. The pattern of fund transfers generally involved leaving no more than 100 ETH in the current address, then roughly evenly splitting the remaining funds before transferring them to the next layer of addresses. Currently, these funds have not been exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or moved to any platforms. The following image shows the fund movement situation at the address 0x32ea020a7bb80c5892df94c6e491e8914cce2641. Open the link in a browser to view a high-resolution image:Continuing our investigation with MistTrack, we explored the initial phishing address from the incident, 0xd9A1C3788D81257612E2581A6ea0aDa244853a91, and discovered that its transaction fees were sourced from 0xdcddc9287e59b5df08d17148a078bd181313eacc.Upon investigating this fee address, we observed that from April 19 to May 3, this address initiated over twenty thousand small transactions, distributing small amounts of ETH to various addresses for phishing purposes.The pattern revealed in the image above indicates that the hacker employed a widespread net approach, suggesting multiple victims. Through extensive scanning, we also identified other related phishing incidents.Using the address 0xbba8a3cc45c6b28d823ca6e6422fbae656d103a6 from the second incident as an example and tracing its transaction fee addresses upwards, we found overlap with the fee origin address from the 1155 WBTC phishing incident, indicating they are likely operated by the same hacker.Further analysis of the hacker\u2019s movement of other illicit gains (from the end of March to present) revealed another laundering pattern: converting ETH on-chain funds into Monero or transferring them across chains to Tron and then into suspected OTC addresses. This suggests a possibility that the hacker may use the same method to move the funds obtained from the 1155 WBTC phishing incident.Based on the threat intelligence network of SlowMist, we have identified several IPs suspected to be used by the hacker, originating from mobile stations in Hong Kong (the use of VPNs has not been ruled out):- 182.xxx.xxx.228- 182.xxx.xx.18- 182.xxx.xx.51- 182.xxx.xxx.64- 182.xxx.xx.154- 182.xxx.xxx.199- 182.xxx.xx.42- 182.xxx.xx.68- 182.xxx.xxx.66- 182.xxx.xxx.207It is noteworthy that even after stealing 1155 WBTC, the hacker does not seem to have any intention of ceasing their criminal activities.Following up on the previous collection of three initial phishing addresses (which provide transaction fees to numerous phishing addresses), a common characteristic is that the amount of the last transaction is significantly larger than previous ones. This indicates the hacker\u2019s method of deactivating current addresses and transferring funds to new phishing addresses, with the three newly activated addresses still frequently transferring funds.In subsequent large-scale scans, we identified two deactivated parent addresses linked to this hacker, which we will not detail further here:- 0xa5cef461646012abd0981a19d62661838e62cf27- 0x2bb7848Cf4193a264EA134c66bEC99A157985Fb8As the investigation progressed, we questioned the source of the hacker\u2019s ETH chain funds. After tracking by the SlowMist security team, it was found that the hacker initially conducted similar end-to-end digit phishing attacks on the Tron network. After profiting there, they targeted Ethereum chain users, transferring the proceeds from Tron to start phishing on the Ethereum chain. Below is an example of the hacker\u2019s phishing activity on the Tron network:On May 4, a victim communicated the following message to the hacker on the blockchain: \u201CYou\u2019ve won, brother. You can keep 10% and return the 90%. We can act like nothing happened. We both know $7 million is enough to live very comfortably, but $70 million will keep you up at night.\u201DOn May 5, the victim continued to publicly call out to the hacker on the blockchain, but has not yet received a response.Use of Whitelisting Mechanism: It is advisable for users to save trusted addresses in their wallet\u2019s address book. For future transactions, users can select the target address directly from the wallet\u2019s address book, which reduces the risk of sending funds to a malicious address.Enable Small Transaction Filtering in Wallets: Users should consider enabling the small transaction filtering feature in their wallets to block zero-value transactions, which are commonly used in phishing. The SlowMist security team analyzed such phishing techniques in 2022. Interested readers can view their reports on \u201CBeware of TransferFrom Zero Transaction Scams\u201D and \u201CBeware of Same-End-Digit Airdrop Scams\u201D.Carefully Verify Addresses: Users should verify not only the first 6 digits after the \u201C0x\u201D but also the last 8 digits of the address before confirming a transaction. Ideally, every digit of the address should be checked to ensure its accuracy.Test with Small Transactions: If the wallet in use only displays the first and last 4 digits of an address, consider making a small test transaction first. This method limits potential losses if the address is incorrect or malicious.This article has discussed phishing attacks that exploit addresses with matching beginning and end digits, analyzed the characteristics and fund transfer patterns of the hacker, and provided recommendations for preventing such attacks. The SlowMist security team reminds users that because blockchain operations are irreversible and blockchain data is immutable, it is crucial to meticulously verify addresses before conducting any transactions to avoid asset loss.The content of this article is supported by data from the anti-money laundering tracking system, MistTrack, and aims to analyze publicly available addresses and disclose the results of such analyses.

The customer created an empty bucket for testing purposes, which received millions of authorized requests from a company using the same name as the test empty bucket the customer had created.This incident exposes a potential pitfall for AWS users: A customer created a private S3 bucket for testing purposes. Unknowingly to them, a popular open-source tool with a default configuration used the same name for storing backups. This resulted in a surge of unauthorized requests to the customer\u2019s empty bucket, ultimately leading to a hefty $1,300 bill.Because of that, the misconfiguration caused the requests to be sent to this empty bucket, leading to exorbitant costs. Even though AWS refunded the client, they emphasized that it was an exception. This highlights how unclear and unpredictable fees can be on a centralized platform, leaving customers in the dark about how much they will be charged \u2014 risking paying substantially more than they planned and could afford.Rest assured, alternatives like Züs are designed with your security in mind. There are no hidden costs. There is no charge for requests, bandwidth, or egress. You do not have to worry about paying more for unauthorized requests because the price is paid upfront and only once. Service providers are committed to protecting you from such unexpected behaviors with restrictions that can be easily set on the blockchain to prevent bad actors or misconfigurations from ever posing a risk to you or your clients.Wrapping it up for today!

While many efforts are invested in the security of smart contracts, in this research we chose to focus on another area that is less spoken \u2014 the security of the native code of the blockchain network. During our research we found some interesting finding that can be a good example of how a small coding mistake can be critical and very harmful when it happens in the core native code of a blockchain network.We are looking for a blockchain network that isn\u2019t one of the Top-10 Blockchain projects, but has a market cap of hundreds of millions of dollars. Filtering the list of bounties in Imunnifi platform, we chose the ICON project (about 250M$ market cap).ICON network (https:\/\/icon.community\/) is a blockchain project and cryptocurrency that aims to connect various blockchain networks, allowing them to interact with one another through a decentralized network called the ICON Republic. The ICON blockchain, also known as the ICON Network, was developed by the ICON Foundation, a South Korean blockchain technology company.Our first step was to deploy a local testnet using the official docker from the ICON website. The docker runs the validator code from a github repository called \u201Cgoloop\u201D. We initiated our local network by following this manual. For our tests, we created wallets using the genesis file.Having run the docker locally, we cloned the code from github, opened it with GoLand, and set up the remote debug connection to the local ICON docker. It allowed us to follow the transaction parsing process step by step and stop it using breakpoints whenever we wanted (see this guide for more information).The code of blockchain networks can be quite complex, with numerous attack surfaces. We decided to narrow our focus to the process of handling new transactions, which involves complex parsing logic. We chose this area because it deals directly with user input and can be activated through both the RPC interface and the P2P interface. Furthermore, we presumed that successfully exploiting a validator through this process would allow us to automatically exploit all validators via the gossip protocol.Upon delving into the flow of processing new transactions, we chose to focus on a particular transaction type: the deployment of a new smart contract.The ICON network supports 2 types of Smart Contracts (called \u201CSCORE\u201D in the ICON ecosystem \u2014 \u201CSmart Contract on Reliable Environment\u201D) \u2014 Java based and Python based. We started with the flow of deploying a Python SCORE.When the user sends a transaction for deploying a new python contract, the Python contract is packed in a zip file.Once the validator has completed a few checks (signature verification, gas, etc.), it stores the contract locally. The storing is done by the function \u201CstorePython\u201D from the file \u201Cgoloop\\service\\contract\\contractmanager.go\u201D (see the code below).The function extracts the zip file to a temporary folder on the local file file-system of the validator. The function removes the shared prefix from the path of all the files but keeps the parts of the path that are not shared.For example, If the zip file contains the following files:So the function will remove the \u201Chello_world\u201D prefix but will keep the \u201Cinternal\u201D prefix in the second file. Then the function will join the \u201Cnon-shared\u201D path parts to the \u201CtmpPath\u201D (which is a temporary folder created for this SCORE ), create all the folders in the tree, and then create the file in the folder and write its content to it.Let\u2019s see this flow in the code:Now, the function will go over all the files in the zip, and will check(line 398) if the file path is starting with the package name that we extracted from the path of the \u201Cpackage.json\u201D file.(\u201CpkgBase\u201D which is \u201Chello_world\u201D in our example.)If the path starts with the package name, the function will remove this part from the path(line 401).The interesting part happend at line 420 \u2014 after performing some checks, the function will concat the path from the file name in the zip to the temp folder path. So if the path in the zip file is \u201Chello_world\/internal\/init.py\u201D, after the removal of the prefix and the concating, the file that will be created will be \u201CtempDir\/internal\/init.py\u201D.What makes it interesting? The function does not verify that the \u201Cnon-shared\u201D path prefix does not contain \u201C..\/\u201D. Therefore, if this path is concatenated with tmpPath, the attacker is able to change the location of the written file at his discretion.Additionally, the file will be created with 755 permissions, which means it will be able to execute.So we have an option to write a file whenever we want, with whatever content we wish, that has execution permissions. There are many possible ways to exploit it to RCE, but we focused on searching in the ICON official docker image. A quick search and we found that docker is configured to periodically run (using cronjob) all the files in the \u201C\/etc\/periodic\/15min\/\u201D directory.So for example, the attacker can set the path in the zip file to:hello_world\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/etc\/periodic\/15min\/evilAnd the file content to#!\/bin\/shecho pwnd> \/pwnd#other evil stuffBy doing this, an evil file will be created in the validator docker at path \u201C\/etc\/periodic\/15min\/evil\u201D. Within 15 minutes, the bash script will run and we\u2019ll get a RCE.It is also important to notice that the function will overwrite the file if it already exists. It means that another option to exploit the vulnerability can be to override other contracts code and then call them and withdraw all the funds.The evil zip file creation is done using this steps:.\/goloop\/bin\/goloop rpc sendtx deploy \/mnt\/c\/repos\/exploit_python_contract\/hello.tar \u2014 uri http:\/\/localhost:9080\/api\/v3\/icon \u2014 key_store wallet.json \u2014 key_password gochain \u2014 nid 0x9383b0 \u2014 step_limit 10000000000 \u2014 content_type application\/zip \u2014 param name=AliceWe did not test the exploit on the public testnet since we wanted to avoid malicious actors exploiting it, and because once the exploit is on the blockchain, anyone can watch it. As an alternative, we tested and successfully exploited it on our local testnet we created, which ran the latest version of the code (v1.3.3\u20131-g733a19d9).The full PoC is very simple:So we found a potential RCE in a blockchain network. This can be a disaster for the network, since we potentially can take control over all the validators, which means that we will have full control over the blockchain. We opened a new report in the Immunefi reporting system, under the Bug Bounty Program of ICON network, and after some hours of nerve wracking waiting, we got an annoying response:It basically said that even though the exploit worked on a local testnet, it would not work on the mainnet, and that\u2019s why it was out of scope.So our first report was rejected, but we learned a lot about the ICON network and the code structure. Since the rejection said that Python contracts are Out-Of-Scope, our next step was to focus on the deployment process of the Java SCOREs.After creating a new Java SCORE and compiling the code to Java bytecode, the user should run the \u201Cjar-optimizer\u201D, which is a tool provided by ICON Foundenton.The \u201Coptimizer\u201D performs the following tasks:We performed many tests to try to bypass the class name filtering, but none of them succeeded. So we tried something else. Instead of creating an object of non-whitelisted class (like ProcessBuilder class, which can be used to start a new process) we will try to pass this object as a parameter to one of the functions that the contract exported.But the problem is that there is a verification for the types of the parameters that the exploited function can get. We tried to bypass this verification by creating a legitimate function that gets valid parameters, and after running the \u201Cjar-optimizer\u201D, to manually change the type of the objects in the bytecode.We also needed to change the signature of the functions in the API file, since this file is used when the Java VM that used by ICON calls to function in contracts.This API file is encoded using MessagePack encoding, which is an efficient binary serialization format. So to change it, we looked for a nice and easy MsgPack editor. We found one that looks good and we made the changes that we wanted, saved the file and repacked the JAR file.After sending the transaction to deploy this contract, we received a transaction ID. We checked the status of the transaction (using icx_getTransactionResult) and saw that the transaction is \u201CExecuting\u201D. We waited a few moments and checked again, and it still was \u201CExecuting\u201D. So we tried to send another transaction and check its status, but we got a \u201CPending\u201D as a response. At this moment we understood that the there is something interesting here.We went to the ICON docker and saw that there is exception:It seems that the MsgPack editor corrupted the API file when we used it. The question is, why is this exception not handled properly?The answer to this question lies in the code of parsing the API file. Let\u2019s review the function \u201CValidate\u201D that validates the API file:We can see that the function is using another Function called MethodUnpacker.readFrom and handling a possible IOException. The function MethodUnpacker.readFrom calls to a function from the JAVA MsgPack lib, named unpackArrayHeader:The unpackArrayHeader function, according to the definition, also throws an IOException. But, if we take a closer we will see that this function also can throw another type of exception, by calling the unexpected function:This function actually returns an object of type MessagePackException which extends RuntimeException and not IOException:Due to the mistakenly corrupted API file, an unhandled exception occurred. Somehow, this creates an infinite loop in the validator\u2019s code, preventing it from processing other transactions and generating new blocks. Moreover, the validator gossiped this transaction to all the other validators, which resulted in the whole network stopping from processing new transactions.We created another report on Immunefi dashboard. This one was shorter, but included the most important part \u2014 a working POC. Once we convinced the ICON team that this PoC was in fact a DOS attack, we negotiated the severity of these issues. In spite of the fact that we believed this issue could be classified as Critical (\u201CNetwork not able to confirm new transactions\u201D), we agreed to change the severity to High (categorized as \u201CDisability to make a new block (no consensus working)\u201D). And finally, we got paid for our bounty!Blockchain networks consist of extensive codebases that perform complex logic, harboring numerous potential issues. For bounty hunters, this domain is very attractive, and from my perspective, much more interesting than smart contracts. A functional debug environment streamlines and accelerates bug hunting significantly. Additionally, luck plays a crucial role as an essential tool in every bounty hunter\u2019s arsenal.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*AWUteIZ91VCFAWXC","author":"Elad Ernst","title":"How We Found a 25K$ Bug in a Blockchain Project by Mistake | Bounty Hunting Journey","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/0-d\/how-we-found-a-25k-bug-in-a-blockchain-project-by-mistake-bounty-hunting-journey-21c0c20440f6","tags":[]},{"summary":"We\u2019re back and better than ever with a brand new AI node sale.

This time we\u2019re partnering with KIP Protocol a project that boasts top-tier VC backing, founders with world-class academic credentials, and a clear vision for creating \u2018the mission critical Web3 Base Layer for AI\u2019.Incubated by Animoca Ventures (the VC arm of industry trendsetter Animoca Brands) and partnered with some massive industry players like OKX Wallet and Aethir, KIP Protocol is already well positioned to become a front-runner in the Web3 AI data arena. Already, their clients include respected institutions like Thailand\u2019s Institute of Scientific and Technological Research and the National University of Singapore.What does all this mean for the Samurai family? Well, it means we will get the chance to purchase the licenses to run KIP Protocol Checker Nodes. These form the a crucial part of the infrastructure upon which the KIP ecosystem will flourish, and come with some juicy rewards as a result!We\u2019ve managed to secure these nodes at an excellent price, and will be offering them through the Samurai Starter Launchpad on Monday, May 13.Read on to discover more reasons to be bullish on KIP Protocol, and find out exactly what you need to do to participate in the sale\u2026Let\u2019s cover the most important question first: what exactly are you buying when you participate in a node sale? Well, here\u2019s the simplest answer possible: a node license is an NFT which allows you to generate passive income.If we want to get a little more complex: a node license is an NFT which gives you the right to run a Checker Node on the KIP Protocol network. This means a chance to generate passive income while at the same time ensuring the overall health of the KIP ecosystem.Checker Nodes do this by performing regular, automatic inspections of transaction data, service provider uptime, and all other activity flowing through the KIP network. As a reward for performing these checks, node operators will enjoy payouts comprising 20% of the entire $KIP token supply over the course of 3 years. Additional payments are also generated through network transaction fees, and bonuses which are paid out whenever your node detects improper activity on the network.These might sound like complex processes, but in practice operating a Checker Node is completely automatic. You can either run it on your own hardware using the dedicated KIP Protocol node client, run it on a VPS (Virtual Private Server), or just pass it off to a third-party NaaS (Node as a Service) provider who will handle the whole process for you. Shortly after the sale, we will provide a detailed guide on all three of these setup methods.Whatever you choose to do, you\u2019ll be able to manage the whole process from KIP\u2019s user-friendly dashboard where you can view your node\u2019s metrics and claim your rewards. Your node license will also come with DAO voting rights, allowing you to participate in votes to settle disputes between entities on the platform (with even more rewards for doing so!).These node licenses will be non-transferrable for the first 6 months after TGE, after which they will be freely tradeable.Now that you understand what you\u2019re buying when you participate in the KIP Checker Node sale on Samurai Starter, let\u2019s take a closer look at the network which you\u2019ll be contributing to.KIP Protocol is building a layer of foundational Web3 infrastructure where AI data providers, model providers, and application developers can securely transact.What might that look like in practice? Well, first a firm which builds complex AI models might list their products on the KIP Protocol network to easily monetize their work. Through the platform, these AI models can then be licensed by developers looking to build user-facing apps such as AI agents.In order to optimize these AI applications, developers also require large sets of data to train the models on specific tasks \u2014 these they can also access via feeds from the various data providers integrated with the KIP Protocol network. In essence, it\u2019s a next-gen Web3 framework where all of the players in the AI industry can seamlessly and securely transact with one another.KIP Protocol handles the interchange of data, transfer of funds, and records of data ownership for all of these processes.It\u2019s a win-win for everyone involved: application builders get quick and reliable access to the models and data they need, while the providers of these models and data can easily monetise their work through the power of Web3. The latter simply deploy their creations onto the network as \u2018Knowledge Assets\u2019 and receive revenues directly to their wallet whenever these assets are utilized.And throughout the entire process, each entity retains intellectual property over their creations, and full control over how their data is licensed. This is achieved through the use of NFTs (ERC 3525 standard), which are minted to represent the Knowledge Assets deployed onto the network, as an immutable proof of ownership.In order to do this, Knowledge Asset creators must also must lock a certain amount of $KIP tokens, which act as collateral to ensure they will properly fulfill their obligations while operating on the network.This is where the Checker Nodes come in. Their job is to periodically ping the API endpoint of these AI suppliers and service providers to check three crucial things:If the node detects irregularities with any of the above, it passes the problem on to other nodes to be double-checked. If the nodes achieve a consensus, then the $KIP tokens staked by the asset provider are slashed as punishment (with the seized funds going directly to the node operators who uncovered the discrepancy).This ensures the clients transacting on the KIP Protocol network can trust the credibility and quality of the suppliers they\u2019re interacting with, while incentivizing suppliers to ensure their feeds are accurate and consistent. If any further disputes arise between clients and service providers on the network, it\u2019s the node operators who step in to settle the matter.Each node license comes with DAO voting rights which can be used to vote on the outcome of these disputes, with bonus rewards being paid out for participation. This is a completely optional (but potentially lucrative) aspect of running a KIP Checker Node.A high level of decentralization is essential to ensuring that this system operates effectively, with no one point of failure. In order to achieve this, a maximum of 50,000 of these nodes will be issued.For a more detailed breakdown on the specific tasks each of these nodes is entrusted with, see here.Now onto the part that everybody\u2019s most interested in: the $KIP token rewards. These tokens are paid out as passive income to node operators for running a Checker Node and contributing to the health of the network. Node operator rewards come from various sources:There is no cliff attached to these rewards \u2014 $KIP rewards will begin being generated 7 days after TGE, and paid out to operators every 15 minutes. You\u2019ll be able to claim your rewards whenever you want, with a 30-day cooldown after each withdrawal.All of this is managed from the KIP node operator dashboard. Here you\u2019ll be able to view all of the checks your node has performed over the past 24 hours, the rewards received from each individual income source, and the total amount you\u2019ve yet to claim.Important Note: KYC is not required to participate in the node license sale, however it will be required in order to claim node operator rewards. This makes residents of the United States, Cuba, Iran, Syria, and other jurisdictions ineligible to claim rewards.The KIP team is made up of respected academics in the field of AI research, alongside seasoned Web3 industry professionals. They\u2019re fully doxxed, with demonstrable track records of working with top-tier clients in government and industry. Their combined expertise led KIP Protocol to a gold-medal finish in the 2023 Chainlink Hackathon, against a pool of 18,500 other competitors!In addition, the KIP family extends to include a host of top-tier VC investors, over 200 KOLs, and clients including respected tech and education institutions. Take a look at the depth and breath of the extended KIP network already!Several top industry players have already begun integrating KIP Protocol with their tech. For example, Animoca\u2019s Open Campus \u2014 the worldwide Web3 education hub launched by Animoca Brands \u2014 is using KIP Protocol to create AI-driven applications and revenue streams to power their platform.KIP Protocol has some big plans for the future. For an overview of everything they have lined up, take a look at the roadmap graphic below.Here\u2019s a few brief details on some of our top highlights:The $KIP token will be used throughout the KIP Protocol network, powering everything from transactions to Knowledge Asset deployment. Its utilities within the network include:The total supply of $KIP will be 10,000,000,000 tokens, with an initial circulating supply of 526,000,000. TGE is set to follow later in Q2, and Checker Node rewards will begin being paid out just one week afterwards.These rewards will be drawn from the Ecosystem Fund, with 20% of supply set aside for node operators, to be released throughout the first three years of the project. For the rest of the distribution breakdown, see below:KIP Protocol plans to list the $KIP token on several top-tier exchanges (and given the strength of their backing, we foresee these being truly top-tier). More details on these will follow in the coming months!The launch price and final launch FDV will depend on several factors, including the total number of Checker Nodes sold.So what precisely do you need to do to get in on this action? The short answer: get yourself over to the Samurai Starter launchpad at 11:00 UTC on Monday, May 13. Here\u2019s all of the important information you\u2019ll need:As you can see, we\u2019ve secured 200 KIP Checker Node licenses for our community, at a special discounted price of $620 each!These nodes will be offered up in a two-round sale with the first round lasting 12 hours followed by a FCFS second round lasting an additional 24 hours or while supplies last.

Almost every element on Mande Network depends on a trusted set of users participating in the \u201CDApps\u201D on the network.Therefore, Mande Networks tokenomics\u2014 rewards users proportional to the Credibility score \u201CCRED\u201D they acquire which is calculated based on the \u201Cstakes\u201D they can garner from other networks users. On Mande network \u201CCRED\u201D represents \u201CTrustworthy-ness\u201D of a user.Together vote casting users help choose the most credible users in \u201CProof-of-Credibility\u201D. $MAND is rewarded to the users based on trustworthiness.$MAND Token Utility :The $MAND token, with its three-fold utility, functions within its ecosystem in the following ways:1.Staking on Governors: $MAND tokens allow holders to participate in governance decisions of the Mande RollApp(L2) by staking on governors. Governors vote on your behalf on proposals, suggest changes, or influence the strategic direction of the project. Staking on governors will lead to staking rewards akin to DPoS(Delegated Proof of Stake) chains.2. Network Gas Fees: $MAND tokens are used to pay for transaction fees within the network.3. Credibility Stacking: Users use $MAND tokens as \u2018stake\u2019 to vote on the the credibility of other users. Using credibility staking a user can increase the reputation score(CRED)of another user within the ecosystem by staking his $MAND.Mande Network RollApp(L2) will have a genesis supply of 20 Million $MAND. Allocated as per the table below.The token supply will be following an inflationary schedule to facilitate rewards for Governance staking, Credibility(CRED) staking, Ecosystem grants and Team pool.Starting with 54%, the inflation follows a halving schedule every 2 years. With an initial supply of 20 million $MAND tokens the ecosystem will reach an asymptotic maximum supply of 100 million $MAND tokens over the period of 20 years.Newly released tokens will be distributed as follows :-For every block 30% of the tokens released will form a pool to reward users proportional to their CRED on the network.Rewards will be distributed to the users by a DApp managed by the Mande foundation at https:\/\/app.mande.network\/For every block 30% of the tokens released will be distributed to MAND stakers who stake on governers of the Mande RollApp. Staking on governors will lead to staking rewards akin to staking on validators on L1 chains such as Dymension.For every block 20% of the tokens released will go towards forming the ecosystem grants pool which will be given out as grants to development teams that build DApps on Mande Network. All grants will be voted via governance proposals.20% of released tokens per block are towards the core team building and managing Mande network. The team also runs the RollApp sequencer node.Most importantly, in order to maintain strong decentralisation, in a situation where the initial development team is no longer the primary development team for the network, the chain can choose to reclaim any unreleased tokens from the development team and redirect them to the community pool or towards a new set of development teams via a governance proposal.This token model is created to bootstrap the Mande Network with well-aligned incentives for key stakeholders and contributors. However, Mande Network is first and foremost project to implement Proof-of-Credibility.It will become clearer over time how the token model needs to evolve to best support the needs of the project. The Mande Labs development team already has features in development that are expected to have an impact on the optimal token model design.Thus, the token model is intended to be adapted and updated by the community over time. Such adjustments to the model can be proposed and voted on through on-chain governance.$MAND holders should feel empowered to change the token model of the chain as necessary to support their vision for the platform.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*7UUtg9NnT3dhSEG8wM3H3Q.jpeg","author":"Mande Network","title":"MAND token distribution\u200A\u2014\u200A(Draft).","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@Mande_Network\/mand-token-distribution-draft-9f147be3fdb0","tags":["Tokenomics","Mande","Blockchain","Cosmos","Dymension"]},{"summary":null,"date":null,"post_content":"Since the 2017 bull market, blockchain games have been gaining more and more space in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as drivers of a new gaming model, in which it is possible to \u2018earn to play\u2019 (play-to-earn) and, more than than that, owning your assets \u2018in game\u2019.Recently, Jeff Zirlin of Sky Mavis highlighted the revolutionary potential of Web3 games to drive mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and create economic freedom globally.

Once the Holesky RPC client\u2026","date":"Jan 28, 2024","post_content":"This guide, will cover the configuration of a freshly installed VPS server as an Ethereum Holesky RPC client. Once the Holesky RPC client syncs it can be used as http:\/\/ and ws:\/\/ L1 endpoints for the Taiko Hekla node. This is a detailed guide, also including hints and tips of Linux commands for non-Linux experts. Hope you enjoy it and share with others.You can also follow me on Twitter or chat with me on Discord (0xthan0s)Step 1a: Get a VPSIf you want to run a Taiko Hekla proposer node then a VPS will work. However, for Taiko Hekla prover nodes the requirement is quite different. A prover node requires Intel SGX enabled processors. The ideal configuration is 8 cores and 16GB memory; the bare minimum is 4 cores and 8GB memory. Unfortunately, these processors are not available on VPS servers but rather on bare metal options. See here for a list of SGX compatible processors. In addition, the SGX machine needs to have a compatible FMSPC. For those that wish to run a Taiko Hekla prover node I highly recommend to be 100% sure that the SGX machine is FMSPC compatible. Step 10 of this guide will be dedicated to detailing the steps of enabling a prover successfully.For setting up a Taiko Hekla proposer, I will use a VPS. If you have a VPS server available this is great and you can skip to step 2. if not, I recommend Contabo. They have good options of VPS servers with a good value for money. You can see the available options here. For this guide I used a CLOUD VPS 5 (16 vCPU Cores, 64 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD, 3 Snapshots). 2TB SSD are required for storage, because the Holesky client databases are so IOPS-heavy. I will also utilize the three snapshots that the VPS offers, to mark recovery points of my installation. In case I make a mistake in the process, I can have a recovery point.Now you need to use the IP address of your server and an SSH client\/terminal to access. Personally I use Termius. It provides some great features even in the free version and is available for desktop and mobile. You can download Termius here.On Termius, select Hosts -> New Host -> Type in the IP address of your server (in my example 000.000.000.000 but replace this with yours). Then give it a name like \u201CETH Holesky RPC + Taiko Server\u201D; you will logon as root and also type the password that you provided in the previous step when you registered your new VPS with Contabo. Click connect.This is how it will look when you logon for the first time.Step 1b: Update Linux kernelBefore proceeding check the linux kernel version with command: uname -rLinux kernel, the base component of the OS, needs to be 6.0 or above for EDMM (Enclave Dynamic Memory Management), which Taiko nodes require. To update the kernel on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS , first run the super update command:Once completed then update the kernel with command:This process will take a few minutes. Once completed and back into root prompt, reboot the machine with command:Once the system reboots, reconnect with Termius and check the first line of the screen. Your kernel should be now updated.Tip: If you want to see all available Linux kernel versions run command:Step 2: Add User holeskyThe Ethereum Holesky client cannot be executed with user root. So for this purpose, we need to setup a new user which for instance, could be named holesky. To add user holesky, run command:The system will ask you to choose a password for this new user. Enter one, then confirm. Finally the system will ask for some additional non-important details (full name, room, phones, etc). Press enter to move to each next one.Now we need to give sudo privileges to this new user. On Ubuntu, the easiest way to grant sudo privileges to a user is by adding the user to the \u201Csudo\u201D group. Members of \u201Csudo\u201D group can execute any command as root via sudo and prompted to authenticate themselves with their password when using sudo. To give the sudo privileges to user holesky run the following command:This concludes step 2.Step 3: Docker InstallationWith the Ethereum Holesky client in perspective we will install Docker with user holesky. In case you are user root, switch to user holesky. To do this run command:Continue with the following command (the system may ask for user holesky password). Enter the password and execute.Note: the sudo apt-get update command is the most essential command in Linux to keep a system healthy and up-to-date. This command installs and downloads all the latest package information available for the packages currently installed on the system.To install Docker we need to first setup the Docker repo by running the following batch of commands. You can copy and paste the batch of commands and these will be executed sequentially.After the batch of commands is executed we need to install the latest Docker version by running the following command:Select Y and enter when prompted. This process will take a few minutes. Finally to verify Docker installation run command:This will print a confirmation message \u201CHello from Docker!\u201D and exit.Post-Installation Steps (applies as we installed Docker as non-root user)The Docker daemon binds to a Unix socket, not a TCP port. By default it\u2019s the root user that owns the Unix socket, and other users can only access it using sudo. The Docker daemon always runs as the root user.If you don\u2019t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group.Create the Docker group with command:Most probably you will receive a message that the group already exists. Fine, it\u2019s always good to check. Add user holesky to the Docker group with command:Now switch to user root with command su - root password etc. and switch immediately back to user holesky with command su - holesky. Now check that you can run Docker commands with user holesky without usingsudo:Docker is now installed. Next step Git.Step 4: Git InstallationTo install Git with user holesky, run the following command:Select Y and enter when prompted. This process will take a few minutes. Verify Git installation with command:Step 5: Holesky Client ConfigurationNow let\u2019s get the Holesky client up and running. First we need to clone eth-docker. With user holesky, run command:Once cloning finishes, you are now in eth-docker directory. Run command:Answer \u201Cyes\u201D to both questions.Now run command:Fantastic! The Holesky archive node is almost ready.Now we need to configure the Eth Docker. Have an Ethereum wallet address handy here. Run command:The pink configuration screen will appear. First, select Holesky network (Holešovice is a district in the north of Prague situated on a meander of the River Vltava. It is the coolest and most vibrant district of the city).Select Ethereum RPC node.Select Lighthouse (Rust).Select Geth (Go).Select the recommended value. Click here for a list of other Ethereum Beacon Chain checkpoint sync endpoints.The consensus layer client will connect to the mev-boost container. So \u201CYes\u201D to using MEV Boost.For MEV relays, the relay value is not visible in this screen here but it does populate in the configuration file. So press enter to proceed. MEV relays can be retrieved from here.Yes Grafana is cool and we want to use it. We will see in a nice dashboard how the Holesky client syncs and operates.Here put the address of an ETH wallet. Always choose a test wallet. After confirming the wallet, ethd terminates with exit and the below screen.Important-don\u2019t start the client yet: We have one very critical change to do in the configuration file plus one more related to Contabo VPS only. The configuration of the Holesky client is stored in file .env. In this file we need to change the following configuration parameters:To do these changes we need to edit the configuration file with the nano editor. So with user holesky and under directory eth-docker run command:To expose the node\u2019s RPC ports (for a Taiko node to make calls to it), we need to append el-shared.yml to the list of files in the COMPOSE_FILE variable of the .env file. Go to line #3 of the configuration file and type in \u201C:el-shared.yml\u201D.Then edit the configuration file, around line #144 and change the value of variable ARCHIVE_NODE to \u201Cfalse\u201D (CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit), finally start the Holesky client again with command:Good to go!The change related to Contabo VPS only: To address the known issue of head jamming, change value CL_P2P_PORT (around line 83) from \u201C9000\u201D to \u201C7000\u201D. Taiko Admins on Discord also recommend to change PRYSM_PORT and PRYSM_UDP_PORT values from \u201C9000\u201D to \u201C7000\u201D as well.Once all required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit.\nCongratulations!!! We are now ready to start the Holesky client.\nIf you are using the system with user root you need to revert to user holesky. To do this, run command (password may be required):Then execute command ls to see folders and files under user holesky.All files and folders utilized by the Holesky client are in directory eth-docker. To open the directory execute command:Check the contents with command ls and locate eth docker file ethd.Start the client with command:Now the client will take sometime to sync. We can follow the sync process and also check operational statistics with the Grafana dashboard.Step 6: Grafana dashboard for Holesky client (port 3000)The dashboard is by default open to port 3000. Open a browser, insert your server\u2019s IP address add a column and the port 3000 and press enter.The browser will open the Grafana logon screen. The default user name is admin and the default password is again admin. Grafana will request you to choose your own password.Once you enter Grafana environment select Home, then Dashboards. You can use the default eth-docker dashboard. I also use the ETH Docker Logs dashboard.Grafana eth-docker dashboard looks like this. Watch for the blocks increasing and synchronizing and the chain head having this triangular shape. Once the client reaches current block, then synchronization is achieved.The current block of Eth Holesky can be seen here. Below image shows the client synchronized with the blockchain.Holesky client: Stopping, Starting, Updating and Log ReviewingHere are a few commands for service management and log reviews of the Holesky client. As always, add sudo to these commands if the user is not part of the docker group.Step 7: Run a Taiko Hekla NodeIn this guide I will install the Taiko node with user root. The prerequisites of Docker and Git are already installed in previous steps. There are two methods to run a Taiko node: with stn and with simple-taiko-node. For the purpose of this guide I will run the Taiko node with simple-taiko-node. If you wish to tryout the stn method revert to Taiko Docs.First we need to clone simple-taiko-node from Github. Run command:Once this command completes then open directory simple-taiko-node by running the following command:Now copy the configuration file with command:Now we need to edit the configuration file and set the L1 Holesky archive client endpoints and the beacon client. On Taiko Discord you can see the pinned beacon client.So to edit the configuration file run command:Change the two L1 endpoints in the configuration file, as per below:L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP=http:\/\/192.168.1.1:8545L1_ENDPOINT_WS=ws:\/\/192.168.1.1:8546Make sure to replace 192.168.1.1 of my example above, with the IP of YOUR Holesky client.Also change the L1_BEACON_HTTP=http:\/\/unstable.holesky.beacon-api.nimbus.team\/Once the required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit. Now we are ready to start the Taiko Node.Note: In case you ran a Taiko node previously, make sure to first remove the old volumes with command:As user root, start the node with command:Once the node starts, check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Taiko L2 with the following command copy and paste as-is.This command should return the chainId as 0x28c61\n{ \u201Cjsonrpc\u201D: \u201C2.0\u201D, \u201Cid\u201D: 1, \u201Cresult\u201D: \u201C0x28c61\u201D }Also check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Taiko L2 \/ L3 block from the Execution Layer client:If the blockNumber response value is 0 or not growing, check the Taiko L2 logs with command:Step 8: Grafana dashboard for Taiko Hekla node (port 3001)The dashboard is by default open to port 3001. Open a browser, insert your server\u2019s IP address add a column and the port 3001 and press enter.Grafana L2ExecutionEngine dashboard looks like this. Watch for the blocks increasing and synchronizing and the chain head having this triangular shape. Once the client reaches current block, then synchronization is achieved. The current block of Taiko Hekla can be seen here.Once the node is synced then we can proceed to additional steps to enable the node as a proposer (this guide will be updated shortly).Taiko node: Stopping, Starting, Updating and Log ReviewingHere are a few commands for service management and log reviews of the Taiko node. As always, add sudo to these commands if the user is not part of the docker group.Step 9: Enable a Taiko Hekla ProposerOnce the node from the previous step syncs with the Taiko blockchain we can proceed to the next step and enable a Taiko Hekla proposer node. The steps are very simple to achieve. It only requires a a few changes in the configuration file. So in directory simple-taiko-node run command:In the configuration file we need to change the following configuration parameters:Once all required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit. Now we are ready to restart the Taiko Node in order for the parameters to be activated. As user root, stop the node with command:The start the node with command:You can also use the restart sequence which combines both commands:You can also check blocks proposed (with success or fail) using holesky etherscan. Copy and paste the proposer wallet address.In Holesky etherscan you can see blocks proposed successfully (in green rectangle) and blocks proposed with fail. Failed propose blocks means that the proposer tried to propose but another proposer did it faster and cheaper, hence the failure. You need to DYOR and understand what works better for you and the market. Finally, on holesky etherscan you can also see the transaction fee in ETH. Happy proposing!!Taiko Proposer: Stopping, Starting, and Log ReviewingHere are a few commands for service management and log reviews of the Taiko Proposer node. As always, add sudo to these commands if the user is not part of the docker group.The DojonodeWolfez and Helios of the Taiko team created this beautiful node monitoring dashboard, where you can see at a glance, everything that matters around your proposer or prover: this is the Dojonode.To install the Dojonode, execute the below transactions.To call the Dojonode, just type the IP address of your node on the browser and add port 7744. Then just click on the 📡 button and change \u201Clocalhost\u201D to the IP address of your node. You can also add the wallet so the node can monitor proposed blocks, proved blocks and the balance of ETH in Holesky testnet and Hekla testnet.See here for more information about the Dojonode. Enjoy and give a shoutout to Wolfez and Helios.Step 10: Enable a Taiko Hekla ProverThis is going to be a lengthy one, as enabling a prover requires a lot of steps. First things first, for an SGX AND FMSPC compatible machine I have chosen OVH. For the purpose of this guide I have used a Rise-3 dedicated server. If you choose OVH, then before everything else you need to enable SGX. This is available as an option on the server management page. Once enabled, you will have to reboot. Once the green \u201CEnabled\u201D indication is visible you are good to go.Prerequisites from previous steps:In this guide, I will install the Taiko Hekla prover with user root.\nBy default, OVH does not allow login to the root account via SSH. You will only have access with a generic user named \u201Cubuntu\u201D. In case you proceed with an OVH server, then run the following commands one by one:Now you will be able to connect your OVH machine with user root.Note: Intel SGX is a technology that requires extensive configuration, with setups varying considerably based on the attestation type (EPID, ECDSA). Although Taiko team has made efforts to simplify the development environment setup, some prerequisites are too complex to automate fully with Dockerfiles.It\u2019s important, however, to understand these steps, even though machines like the OVH Rise-3, are proven to be SGX\/FMSPC compatible. Analyzing the configuration process will provide deeper insights and understanding.Step 10.1: Install cpuid toolTo verify if the CPU is SGX-enabled, we need to install the cpuid tool. So run command:Then run command:If you see the below result then the CPU is SGX-enabled.Step 10.2: Create an Intel PCS accountAs per Taiko instructions, the ECDSA attestation requires a subscription to the Intel PCS service here (instructions here). This subscription will provide us with a primary API key and a secondary API key. These keys are required and will be used in the next steps.Step 10.3: Determine FMSPC support | Install PCKIDRetrievalToolThis is a mandatory step to ensure that the SGX-enabled machine is supported by Raiko. Currently the supported FMSPCs are only:\n00606A000000\n00A067110000\n00906ED50000To install the tool run the following commands (enter \u201CY\u201D where asked):Once the tool is installed then run the below command to retrieve FMSPC.You will be asked to enter the Intel PCS API key from step 10.2. Here you can enter either the primary API key or the secondary API key. You will also be asked for a pccs password; just press Enter.You will receive the FMSPC key.Step 10.4: Install GramineAs per Taiko team, Raiko leverages Intel SGX via Gramine. Here you can see the available distributions. In our case we will install Gramine for Ubuntu 22.04 with a Bash script. You can find more information about scripts here.To install Gramine, we will create a script called install_gramine.sh and in this file we will insert all the installation commands, plus two extra lines to mark the beginning and end of the script. Copy and paste the script as below.The script file, install_gramine.sh, is now ready to be executed with the below command. This will take a few minutes. Respond with \u201CY\u201D when required.Gramine is now installed.Step 10.5: Additional installationsExecute the command below to prepare the prover with some additional required installations.Step 10.6: Generate PCCS certificates and edit default.json fileThis step is related to SGX-specific requirements about configuring PCCS (Provisioning Certificate Caching Service). PCCS retrieves PCK certificates during runtime and then caches them in the local database. PCCS uses the same http interfaces as Intel PCS.To generate the certificate run the below commands one by one. Note that the firsst openssl command will require some additional information. You can ignore all, perhaps enter an email when requested.How the output looks.During the next step the system will generate the below error. As per the Taiko team it should be ignored.But in case you have coding error PTSD (like myself) and would like to install the latest version of nodejs and avoid the error, below are the commands to achieve this.You can also check the installed nodejs version with command: node -v\nNext run the below commands to generate the default.json file and then copy it. There might be an error related to cracklib-runtime, ignore it.Now let\u2019s edit the default.json file, which you can see with the ls command.We need to edit four parameters in the default.json file. You can edit default.json with command:hosts: replace it with \"0.0.0.0\"\nApiKey: Use either the Intel PCS primary or secondary key you obtained from step 10.2.\nUserTokenHash: Here you just have to execute command echo -n \"user_password\" | sha512sum | tr -d '[:space:]-'), where you can replace \u201Cuser _password\u201D with any string.In this case, I executed the command as-is, with no change. Take the value 6ae2d3bfb3b95517b358fcdb29\u2026\u202602920ddeb1a6c6df4e8a00 and paste to UserTokenHash.AdminTokenHash: Similarly, here you just have to execute command echo -n \"admin_password\" | sha512sum | tr -d '[:space:]-'. Again, I executed the command as-is, with no change. Take the value 31a556961f3438f9f632ca27812d\u2026\u202697937c28310a7ab62a9ae1c15d96d69 and paste to AdminTokenHash.Once the required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the default.json file and then CTRL-X to exit.Very important, run the below command to modify the permissions of default.jsonFinally, create the below directories, one by one.Step 10.7: Clone and Bootstrap RaikoNow let\u2019s clone Raiko and build the docker images. Firstly, execute the below command.Now before building the image, we need to check parameter \u201Csgx.max_threads\u201D in the configuration file \u201Csgx-guest.docker.manifest.template\u201D and make sure the value is \u201C32\u201D. Execute the next set of commands.You should be able to see this fileEdit the file as below.If the value \u201Csgx.max_threads\u201D is \u201C32\u201D then CTRL-X and exit. If it is \u201C16\u201D then change to \u201C32\u201D and then CTRL-S to save and CTRL-X to exit.Once this change is done, then we can build the image. Execute below commands and then lay back and watch the show. This will take sometime.Once complete you will see the screen as above. Now run the following command.You should be able to see at least the following two images: gcr.io\/evmchain\/raiko and gcr.io\/evmchain\/pccs.Now you are ready to bootstrap Raiko. Execute the next command.If everything is executed correctly then raiko-init exited with code 0 and you should be able to see a Public key, an Instance address and a quote.Bootstrapping should also generate a bootstrap.json which contains the relavant information and you can check with the following command.It should look like the below example. The \u201Cquote\u201D is quite a lengthy string and we will need this later on.Now Raiko is ready to be executed through Docker. Next step to attest the prover on-chain, receive some TTKOh and start proving!Step 10.8: Perform on-chain remote AttestationAs a first step, let\u2019s clone taiko-mono with command:Then open directory \u201Cprotocol\u201D:Now run the below commands:And continue with the below commands:The compiler will inform you in the end if everything is successful.At this stage you need to define the private key of the wallet that you are going to use on this prover. Always use a new fresh wallet. Run the below command filling your private key.Next step open folder script and look for config_dcap_sgx_verifier.shAs per Taiko Docs, we need to compare the below three values with what is in the config_dcap_sgx_verifier.shscript. These three values are:SGX_VERIFIER_ADDRESS=0x532EFBf6D62720D0B2a2Bb9d11066E8588cAE6D9 ATTESTATION_ADDRESS=0xC6cD3878Fc56F2b2BaB0769C580fc230A95e1398 PEM_CERTCHAIN_ADDRESS=0x08d7865e7F534d743Aba5874A9AD04bcB223a92ETo compare we need to view the config_dcap_sgx_verifier.shscript. We can do this as follows. Edit the script with command:As you can see from the above screenshot the values match. Now CTRL-X to exit the script without saving.Once the values are confirmed we move to the next step where we will utilize the quote that we obtained earlier, when we bootstrapped Raiko.\u2026 this is a work in progress! If you would like to continue on your own, you can consult the very detailed documentation on Taiko Docs.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*84FH7G5QVotW_5D3-S0j2w.jpeg","author":"0xThanos","title":"How to Setup a Taiko Node and Holesky RPC Client","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@thaninsta\/how-to-setup-a-taiko-node-and-holesky-rpc-client-1c9413396aec","tags":["Holesky Testnet","Taiko","Blockchain"]},{"summary":"In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi), innovation is not just a goal; it\u2019s a necessity.

Trex20 is ready to shake things up with its latest feature: the Gamified Venture on BRC20 and EVM chains. This groundbreaking addition promises to revolutionize how communities\/individuals secure allocation, injecting an unprecedented level of excitement and engagement into the process.Traditionally, participating in Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) and securing allocations has been a straightforward but often mundane process. Users typically stake tokens or simply rush to grab their share on a first-come, first-served basis. However, not just with staking or FCFS allocations but Trex20 is flipping the script by introducing multiple avenues through which users can secure allocations, each more thrilling than the last.For those who believe in the power of commitment, the Stake-to-Whitelist feature offers a pathway to allocation security. By staking tokens on the platform, users can earn the coveted whitelist status, ensuring their participation in upcoming IDO rounds.Prepare for a gaming experience like never before with the Play-to-Secure feature. Here, users can compete against one another, striving to climb the leaderboard and secure their allocation through sheer skill and determination. This gamified approach injects an element of fun and competitiveness into the allocation process, enticing users to engage like never before.Owning Trex20 Ordinals NFTs opens yet another avenue to allocation security. NFT holders enjoy privileged access to allocations, further incentivizing participation in the platform\u2019s ecosystem.For those who prefer a more direct approach, the Pay-to-Secure feature offers a streamlined option to secure allocations. Users can simply make a payment in $TX20 to lock in their share, ensuring a hassle-free experience.Of course, Trex20 hasn\u2019t forgotten its roots. The classic first-come, first-served model remains an option for users who prefer a swift and straightforward approach to allocation.By incorporating these diverse and engaging features, Trex20 is not only redefining how allocations are secured but also transforming the entire experience of participating in IDO rounds. With Gamified Venture, every user becomes an active participant in the excitement and thrill of token launches.But the innovation doesn\u2019t stop there. Trex20 is committed to maximizing the utility of its native TX20 token and Trex20 Ordinals NFTs. Partial profits in tokens will be shared with NFT holders, rewarding their loyalty and investment in the platform. Additionally, token burns from payments received in tokens during Gamified Venture participation will contribute to making the TX20 token deflationary, further enhancing its value proposition.In essence, the Gamified Venture represents more than just a feature update; it symbolizes Trex20\u2019s ongoing commitment to innovation and user-centric design as the platform continues to evolve and grow to push its developments beyond mundane.Get ready to level up your allocation game with Trex20\u2019s Gamified Venture.

It\u2019s overflowing in fact and that\u2019s wonderful. Here\u2019s why.","date":"Jul 31, 2023","post_content":"N\nearly 2 million years ago, we figured out how to turn a boring old lump of rock into a tool. Quite an astonishing feat of brain power. As a result, rather than tearing off meat with our hands we could slice up some very nice t-bone steaks. We somehow also knew cooked meat was not just tastier, but better for us.We also figured out that the more of our kind we shared this information with, the better our chances for survival. Our distant ancestors knew there was safety in numbers. So we evolved methods of communication; language, cave drawings. Arriving to where we are today with the single biggest, most complex communication technology we\u2019ve ever built; the internet.Some will say that the original idea of the internet, to be a free, wide open space for ideas and innovations has gone the way of the DoDo bird. Extinct. Not really.What has changed is the evolution of the internet. It was largely open and wild, the domain of the hippies who grew tired of communes and a lack of proper showers and came back closer to the urban core of San Francisco and started playing with computers.All the communications technologies we create evolve. Just like us.Even thousands of years ago, we created moving images on cave walls. Using some form of dyes and flickering flames. Think YouTube and TikTok is cool? Yep, they are. But neither would be here today without our ancestors, thousands of years ago, who used pigments and torch flames to create the first TikTok or YouTube videos of what we see today.When the printing press arrived on the scene around 500 years ago, it was a similar wild west. Creative entrepreneurs set up simple presses in their own shops. An entire ecosystem grew up around printing presses for ink, press manufacturing, tools, typefaces. The same happened with the internet; laptops, tablets, smartphones and of course, software.Humans are inherently social and innovative animals. We invented communications technologies because it made it easier to share ideas, to find common ground in our varied realities. The better our communications tools, the more organised we became, the more we could evolve as a species and evolve our technologies.As each communication technology evolved, so did our societies and how we managed communication\/information. For many years, radio stations were a disorganized mish-mash, especially in the United States. Regulations came along fairly quickly and societal norms were imposed. Radio stations formed networks and became in effect, walled gardens.The same happened with the printing press and television networks. Telephone networks became huge and conglomerates formed, leading in some places, to monopolies. Hence the break-up of AT&T in America.Today we talk how the internet has become a place of walled gardens with Tech Giants thundering over the digital landscape keeping any trespassers at bay. Fortunately, that\u2019s mostly a fairy tale. Yes, there are walled gardens and the giants will, at times, let you play in someone elses sandbox. For a fee. Usually your personal data.But the internet is still a very creative place. It is more wild west than not. If we think of the internet in terms of a map comparable to the real world, we might say that the Tech Giants have built glittering cities in parts of the world. WeChat is like Beijing. Facebook and Google are San Francisco and New York. Snap is Toronto. Between these shimmering cities remain untamed, vast open spaces.These wild spaces are where ideas are constantly sparking into life, like sprites in a forest. Sometimes they are created in rigid spaces in the cities of the giants. More often, they are born on the edges, in the wilds. In decentralized spaces, the fediverse. By humans of all walks of life, from all cultures and societies.Some call parts of these wild spaces the Dark Web, where bandits lurk, like the bandits of old that preyed on traveling caravans along trade routes. Yes, there are nefarious denizens of the Dark Web. But there are lots of good people in those haunts. Creating, ideating. Imagining new futures.There are many open spaces where code and ideas get generated. Blockchain, the concept of decentralisation and crypto that leverages blockchain and other technologies.These are far more than just technologies. They are arguments, debates and social statements to begin with. They are created by people who imagine a different world, a new or more innovative way of doing things.There are far more interesting, exciting and innovative ideas being generated because of the internet than there are nefarious, nasty things. If one steps back from tech industry news, explores online communities not just on sites like Reddit, but fediverse sites like Mastodon and others, they are like percolating coffee pots of ideas.Some of those ideas will evolve and spill over into society and become new businesses and services. Cultures will explore them and decide if they want them and if they do, how they want to adapt them to make them work.But to claim that the internet has become completely corporatized is to miss the conversations taking place, the bubbling of ideas and the ones turning into something new and meaningful.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*CLdK4cqAcA19tjKF1MEmNg.png","author":"Giles Crouch | Digital Anthropologist","title":"The Internet Is Still Wide Open","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@gilescrouch\/the-internet-is-still-wide-open-46726a9692d0","tags":[]},{"summary":"Certification, via our partner Civic, is ready!

Failing to address this can be life-threatening for a protocol, when there are so many alternative projects and activities for a passerby to allocate their attention to. We\u2019ve seen it time and time again: A project may have the best product or tech, but unless it\u2019s easy to grasp or get into, no one will want to devote the energy required to understand it.How then to create the easiest onramp to an outside user? At HOO, the d\u2019app and game side are made to take advantage of preexisting mechanisms and venues that the public already frequents in their day to day. Moreover, crucial concerns on the technical level (bridging, identity, etc) are abstracted at the point of interaction, meaning there are simply less things for a user to think about \u2014 this leaves time for them to get into what they\u2019re after in the first place: an exciting, immersive activity blending a basic mix of fun and strategy. This is accomplished in a few ways:As native crypto users, the most commonly frequented apps you will likely see are Telegram, Discord, and of course, Twitter (now X). However, with 800 million users globally and a built in feature to port games (in addition to its own native blockchain), Telegram presents the best opportunity to expose HOO to a vast new audience of users while enabling an easy, mobile-friendly point of interaction. Already hanging with a few friends in a group chat? Why not open the HOO channel, and challenge your buddies to see whose gladiator is best?The same spirit involved in this will be supported through designated mobile store apps as well, and with discord embeds, enabling native venues that have their own users to begin with, to serve as sources of user growth and retention.Another hurdle to overcome is the challenge of technical stress and the litany of things that can and do go wrong within the crypto industry. How does one alleviate the stress normally associated with navigating 85 different chains, bridging solutions, and points of interaction? With HOO, we opted for a web based launcher, eliminating the need for a standalone downloaded client, meaning users can simply connect via a standard wallet, and begin playing, no additional time or equipment required. Finally and most critical to this area, while a user may have liquidity on a number of chains, they need not manually bridge or worry about how to pool funds. With HOO\u2019s native $AMBR being designed as a LayerZero 0ft, despite the contracts for the infrastructure residing on BASE, users will be able to connect and play from any chain they happen to prefer.What\u2019s next? With $AMBR\u2019s TGE just around the corner, and the MVP for gladiatorial combat entering the testnet, there are numerous opportunities to qualify for HOO\u2019s second round of airdrops, and to best situate yourself to take advantage of its growth.Make sure to follow our Twitter and join our Discord to learn about the latest offerings, the (soon to be announced) TGE and trading venue for $AMBR, and all the ongoing updates and developments!","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*vKE3BqL1Mz1vRiI8","author":"The Halls of Olympia","title":"UI\/UX and User Acquisition: How HOO Appears to You","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@HallsofOlympia\/ui-ux-and-user-acquisition-how-hoo-appears-to-you-6b9b907b2664","tags":["Gaming","Blockchain","Crypto","Cryptocurrency"]},{"summary":"From Courtrooms to The Blockchain: DDR at the intersection of decentralization and justice","date":"Aug 6, 2023","post_content":"As an emergent form of organizing and coordinating activities, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are changing the landscape of governance.

The Origin","date":"May 2, 2024","post_content":"Ordinals became a significant game changer in the NFT segment in 2023. Since their introduction on the Bitcoin blockchain, the daily inscriptions have shown a consistent increase. As of now, there have been a total of 66,348,042 inscriptions.Ordinals introduced an innovative approach to creating NFTs, meme tokens, and other digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, it caused lots of discussions within the community. Ordinals utilize inscriptions to store content directly on the blockchain, leading to skepticism among many users about its overall benefit to the ecosystem. Concerns were raised that the block space occupied by these NFTs could potentially increase fees and reduce transaction speeds.Over time, it became clear that Ordinals have become a crucial component of the Bitcoin blockchain, laying the foundation for their integration into decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and yield farming platforms.Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, stated, \u201CBitcoin-NFT technology has the potential to foster innovation in the digital asset market.\u201D He also mentioned that the creation of applications and further development of the blockchain would accelerate its mass adoption. As observed, the number of application inscriptions grew significantly in 2024.Taking that into account, it was only a matter of time before Ordinals and immersive augmented reality (AR) merged.The Jade98 platform introduces the first-ever AR inscriptions (Jade ARdinals), set to redefine the standards of digital collectibles. It was created to enhance efficiency, transparency, and unique user engagement in the DeFi segment.With the Jade98 platform, you can not only upgrade your existing BRC collections but also craft ARdinal collections right from scratch.Let\u2019s explore the groundbreaking Jade98 platform, which allows its users to create Jade ARdinals and earn rewards for their activity.To understand the whole Jade98 Platform ecosystem, it\u2019s important to learn the main functionality of its basic element.The JD98 token is the cornerstone of the entire ecosystem. It facilitates payments for core functionalities, such as using AR technologies, on the platform. Creators also receive staking rewards in $JD98 tokens.Its primary utility is to support commissions and transactions throughout the platform, serving as its vital lifeblood.At the heart of Jade98 platform lies the concept of epochs \u2014 fixed intervals of time 1999998 sec. At the end of each epoch, significant events occur, such as stakers receiving their JD98 rewards or the burning of the revenue treasury.Check out the detailed scheme of the platform below:These are the main tokenomics processes that maintain the functionality and financial payback of the system. Unlike the tokenomics of many other DeFi platforms, all processes on the Jade98 Platform are fully transparent, with no hidden pitfalls.Now, let\u2019s review each of these processes individually.Central to Jade\u2019s platform revenue model is the provision of augmented reality (AR) services. You have the freedom to craft an exciting ARdinal collection from scratch, complete with all metadata. Overall, you get the full package: create your AR, mint it on the blockchain, and showcase your unique digital masterpiece.For these innovative opportunities, users pay a service fee in BTC upon initiating the mint transactions (similar to Luminex\/Unisat inscription service).This revenue is collected in the platform\u2019s treasury for subsequent distribution through various mechanisms: rewards pool for stakers, Buyback and Burning mechanism, and other processes that ensure sustained growth and profitability of Jade98 platform.Another important feature of Jade98 platform is the Buyback and Burning mechanism, wherein 20% of incoming revenue is allocated towards purchasing $JD98 tokens from the market.The process is depicted in detail in the upper part of the whole Jade98 platform tokenomics scheme.As you see, the Service Revenue users pay for ARdinals creation is then converted to JD98 for the further Burning and then accumulated in the Burning Treasury to be systematically burned at the end of each epoch. The system sends them a Bitcoin Eater address, thereby enhancing the token value.Stakers on the platform can enjoy multiple avenues for staking, enabling them to extract tokens from circulation and lock them within the platform in exchange for a share of profits generated during the epoch.As you can see from another part of the tokenomics scheme, there are several ways of staking available.In this case, you\u2019ll receive your rewards at the end of the epoch.For the Jade Pair Staking, you\u2019ll need to get an ARdinal from Jade ARdinals Collection. This will increase your rewards by staking a special Jade ARdinal with JD98$.The payment amounts and, accordingly, the APY indicator are affected by:Initially, Simple Staking will be developed and launched using a simplified formula. Over time, it will be enhanced by refining the formula and adding additional assets for boosting.At the end of each epoch, rewards from the previous epoch are calculated and disbursed from the Reward Pool in $JD98 tokens. Thus, new rewards are sent to users every 23 days. Regular revenues enable you to redistribute your income correctly and reinvest a portion for additional earnings.Users have the option to receive payouts directly to their addresses or initiate transactions to claim their rewards, with the latter option to minimize transaction fees.Additionally, accrued rewards incur compound interest if left unclaimed.At Jade98 Platform, we strive to develop the effective and transparent tokenomics system that will not only enhance AR\/VR functionality but also contribute to our users\u2019 success and increase their income.The groundbreaking integration of AR services with Ordinals will boost the incorporation of the Bitcoin blockchain into the DeFi sector and its mass adoption worldwide. This represents a perfect new direction for immersive, real-world applications to develop and a powerful means to foster a sustainable digital economy.Follow our X(Twitter) to get more information about upcoming events.Join Telegram chat for discussions.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*s8JqylJ6d_AS4L-BBMb8cw.png","author":"Jade ARdinals","title":"Defining the DeFi future - Jade98 Platform Mechanics","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@jade-ordinals\/defining-the-defi-future-jade98-platform-mechanics-b81a71a84ad8","tags":[]},{"summary":"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, a new player, $WISE, is making waves with its forward-thinking approach.

We were planning to discuss\u2026","date":"Jul 17, 2023","post_content":"A few weeks ago I was talking to Michal, who is a Lead Security Engineer over at Resonance Security. We were planning to discuss cross-chain issues, but as is always the case, the conversation meandered off into different fields, mostly concerning how the programming language you use shapes your view of the world.There is a theory of mind based on language with a name that sounds like it came straight out of Star Trek.The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.Simply put, it proposes that the grammar and vocabulary of the language we think in, and the society that we live in and which spawned that language, profoundly influence the way we interpret the world around us. Together, both frame and limit what we are able to mentally conjecture about.Wittgenstein, arguably the foremost philosopher of the 20th century (that is to say, his friends and colleagues argued that he was the foremost philosopher of the 20th century), put in a few simple albeit somewhat inscrutable words:Nobody truly understands Wittgenstein though, possibly because he thought in an Austrian version of the German language, and then translated his thoughts into English.The thing that springs to the mind of any inquisitive software developer reading about these kinds of things is to wonder, \u201CDoes the programming language I choose to program in significantly affect the way I think about the tasks at hand? Am I restricting myself by only writing in C++?\u201D(The answer to both those questions is, \u201CProbably, yes.\u201D)You wouldn\u2019t be the first to have such thoughts. Here\u2019s what Paul Graham said about it, a couple of decades ago:But it\u2019s not just programmers who are affected by this.If you are a test engineer or an auditor, and you are reviewing smart contracts, the problem of programming language dissonance can be especially acute. You may be using one language, say, JavaScript, to write tests for smart contracts written in another language, for example, Solidity.This involves exhausting context switching as you shift your focus from one programming language to another, and tired test engineers are always tempted to cut corners. Worse still, it can restrict your thought patterns and cause you to miss some significant areas of testing.JavaScript and Solidity are syntactically not that different. They are both imperative languages \u2014 abstractions of assembly language. And their syntax is very similar; it\u2019s like comparing Spanish to Italian. But there are some notable problems. For example, when passing a value from JavaScript to a Solidity smart contract using Hardhat, you are often going to rely on your framework implicitly converting a JavaScript string to Solidity bytes. The behind-the-scenes conversion can cause bugs to slip through the cracks of your test coverage.The disparity becomes even greater when you are working across two imperative programming languages with a different fundamental raison d\u2019être.For example Rust, which is compiled and requires an understanding of the underlying mechanics of memory allocation and reclamation, versus Python, which is more of a \u201Cget things done quickly\u201D interpreted language with automatic garbage collection. In this case, we are looking at the programming equivalent of comparing German to French.At least they\u2019re both Indo-European languages though.Most of the programmers I have worked with code in a predominantly imperative style, with control flow forming the backbone of their code.But there is another significant class of programming languages: purely functional ones, such as Lisp and Haskell. If you are using JavaScript to test a Cardano smart contract in the Haskell-like language Plutus, then you are doing the coding equivalent of switching between German (an Indo-European language) and Finnish (a Finno-Ugric language with a distinctly different set of grammar rules, even if it does use the same alphabet).Michal uses Foundry to write and test Ethereum smart contracts, whereas I am an adherent to the Hardhat toolchain for those activities. That means that he is writing his tests in Solidity, and I am writing in JavaScript. And as we\u2019re both testing Solidity contracts, he doesn\u2019t have to context switch and I do.If you have the time and budget, ideally you\u2019d hire a version of Michal and one of me to check your contract \u2014 there will be a lot of duplication, but the overlap of our testing will not be 100%.Part of that is because we\u2019re coding and thinking in different languages.But there is another aspect worth considering.The problem with Solidity is that all the really serious bugs are environment related, not code related. What that means is that they depend as much on the EVM \u2014 the way data is stored and executed on Ethereum, as they do on lines of code.This is like looking at a society\u2019s behaviour rather than just its language. To use a cultural analogy: being able to speak Finnish is not going to teach you that you are expected to take your shoes off when entering a house in Finland.The unfortunate conclusion is that to truly test a smart contract thoroughly, you need to fluent not just in the language of the contract, but also in the environment or \u201Cculture\u201D that exists around that contract. And this will include a testing framework.It is also why bridges from one chain to another are so vulnerable. There you are moving not just from one language to another, but from one culture to another as well. A general adage in the business of translating books is that your translator should be a native speaker of the language into which the book is being translated, but they need to be fluent in the language it is coming from.In blockchain, that\u2019s really hard. There are very few people who are native in one chain, and fluent in another. To be frank, there are very few people who are fluent in any given chain, let alone native.Bridges should really be written, and then tested, by people who are fully conversant with both chains.As part of the regular process of talking to the Resonance Security engineers, I am getting to exchange ideas with people from different backgrounds, who think in different languages, and write code in different languages too.This week I was talking to Michal, who is Polish, and predominantly uses Rust. Last week I was in conversation with Joao, who is Portuguese, and prefers Python. And next week I\u2019m going to be interviewing Luis, who informs me that he thinks in Spanish. I\u2019ll find out what his favorite programming language is in due course.That\u2019s a lot of languages, and therefore a lot of different perspectives.Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow[4], and the same may well apply to software vulnerabilities and auditing too.But it doesn\u2019t work if all the eyeballs are the same\u2026[1] B.

If you\u2019d like to start from there, you can find that hereWhat is a Validator and What does it do?Running a ValidatorValidator EconomicsRunning a Profitable ValidatorConclusionBefore we get started, a few terms will come up periodically, so let\u2019s get them out of the way:With that out of the way, let\u2019s dive in.A validator is PoS terminology for a node that participates in blockchain consensus.In PoS, voting nodes put up tokens as collateral that can be seized or destroyed should they behave maliciously.Voting nodes are tasked with:Validators are crucial to the network because they effectively decide what is true. The greater the number of validators, the more secure and decentralized the network is. Stake spread is also very important. But all of this is likely not news to you.Let\u2019s move on to why we\u2019re here.Before we move forward, it\u2019s important we make a distinction between validators and RPC nodes on Solana.In an ideal world, everyone who uses the blockchain would run their own node. These nodes would connect to other nodes to propagate the user\u2019s transactions and verify that the blockchain is true.In practice, this doesn\u2019t happen because of how technically and financially demanding it is to run a node. For most people, RPC nodes are how we interact with the blockchain.An RPC node does two things:This article will focus mainly on validators because the economics of operating an RPC node are obscure.dApps (like wallets) either run their own RPC nodes or pay entities like Helius to use RPC nodes. But these arrangements are done off-chain.We can see Helius\u2019 pricing here, but we have almost no idea about the operational costs or demand. So it\u2019s hard to say how much profit (or loss) RPC providers make.Because of this, we\u2019ll focus exclusively on Validators going forward.For those interested in running RPC nodes, the Solana Tech discord linked at the end of this hosts ann RPC node operator channel. You can ask more questions there.A validator operator\u2019s main job (after completing the setup) is to monitor their node and work on improving its performance.There are two primary things a validator needs:Everything else is secondary.Technical expertise is crucial because, as you\u2019ll soon see, running a validator is technically demanding. You need to understand hardware, DevOps, blockchain architecture and backend development if you\u2019re going to be successful.You can run a node without understanding these things, but you\u2019ll struggle with even the most \u201Cbasic\u201D things.Here\u2019s someone who paid more than double what he should have for hardware but ended up struggling to get his node running because the setup just wasn\u2019t right.You\u2019ll see more examples like this as we move on, have it in the back of your mind that running a node is technically demanding.Aside technical expertise, running a validator can be expensive.Let\u2019s break down the requirements.To run a validator, you need four things: hardware, bandwidth, stake and voting SOLThese are the official recommendations from the Solana Labs documentation:Bandwidth: 1 GBit\/s symmetric, commercial. 10 GBit\/s preferred.In practice, most validators run slightly more powerful machines but there are no benefits to going overboard.There\u2019s no minimum stake on Solana and the network supports native delegation so validators don\u2019t need to (and usually don\u2019t) own all the SOL they stake.But the more you stake, the more likely you\u2019re selected as leader. The exact amounts you should aim for will be discussed in the economics section.On Solana, votes count as transactions, and a validator is expected to vote on every block. It comes out to around 1 SOL per day but we\u2019ll discuss all the nuance in the economics section.With these four things, anyone can run their own validator.And now to the big question: How profitable is it?As a primer to validator economics, we\u2019ll quickly look at a simple overview of Solana\u2019s tokenomics.Solana\u2019s tokenomics are similar to Ethereum\u2019s; there\u2019s inflation to create new tokens and burning to destroy them. The specifics are a little different.When a block is produced, a certain amount of SOL is created as a block reward.The exact amount depends on the current inflation rate.Inflation started out at 8% and is designed to go down by 15% every epoch-year. It\u2019s adjusted every epoch and will continue to fall until it hits 1.5%, which is the \u201Cterminal inflation rate.\u201DThe inflation for this epoch is 5.466% (February 20, 2024).If you run the solana inflation command on the Solana CLI, you\u2019ll obtain the current number:This inflation is currently the only mechanism for creating new SOL tokens.Sidebar: Inflation can be confusing because it seems like token holders are getting diluted, but that\u2019s not true. You can think of inflation as the price that non-stakers pay to stakers for securing the network. Stakers don\u2019t get diluted; only non-stakers do. It\u2019s simply the cost of decentralization. And even Ethereum runs a similar system.The current burn mechanism for Solana is very simple: 50% of all fees are burned. SIMD-0096 will stop burning priority fees, but for now, 50% of all fees are burned.The other 50% is sent to the leader for that slot.And that\u2019s it.Now that we\u2019ve broken down Solana\u2019s economics, let\u2019s move on to why we\u2019re here: Validator economics.This will also be divided into two parts: the Costs and the IncomeIf you\u2019re familiar with computer hardware, you probably already have a rough idea of how expensive the recommended hardware is.It\u2019s more expensive in practice because validator nodes have to be active 100% of the time.That means a dedicated power and cooling system, backup and replacement components, and full-time staff monitoring the computer.All of this makes it impractical to run your validator from home.To work around this, most validator operators use bare-metal servers from Tier 3 data centers for their nodes. Prices can vary widely depending on the location, but Latitude currently charges between $373 and $608 per month for a machine that fits the bill.Bandwidth consumption is hard to estimate because it depends on your stake size.If you\u2019re the leader more often, you\u2019ll send out more data than validators who are leader less often. But the average validator usually processes about 60\u2013100 TB of data per month.This is another reason to use a data center. If you wanted this sort of bandwidth at home, you\u2019d likely need a dedicated line from your ISP.Here\u2019s someone who tried to do it from home and is understandably running into issues:In regards to the costs for a data center, it varies by provider and location.Latitude charges between $0.64 and $3.60 USD\/TB for egress, depending on the region. Ingress is free.Total costs with a projection of 60\u2013100 TB per month amount to anywhere between $38.4 and $360 per month.On Solana, votes count as transactions.Every validator is expected to vote once per slot.Each vote costs 0.000005 SOL. Per epoch, that\u2019s 2.16 SOL.In a year, that amounts to 394.2 SOL and that\u2019s about 1.08 SOL per day.In practice, this number is slightly lower because slots are not exactly 400 ms but on average, it currently costs about 1 SOL per day to vote.Voting costs are easily the most significant expense of running a validator and there\u2019s no way to get around them.Each correct vote earns the validator a credit. At the end of each epoch, the inflation rewards for the epoch are split among participating nodes based on:So if your node doesn\u2019t vote, it\u2019ll lose out on rewards at the end of the epoch.Incentivizing nodes to vote is important because consensus would grind to a halt otherwise.As to why voting transactions cost actual SOL, Toly says it\u2019s a sort of minimum stake requirement.There\u2019s community consensus that this cost creates a centralization vector and there are proposed changes that will reduce its effect but we\u2019ll discuss those later.Staking tokens takes away a lot of their functionality, and like I mentioned already, maintaining a validator is a full-time job.LSTs, stake pools and protocols like Sanctum are actively working to reduce the impact of the financial opportunity cost. But as an aspiring validator, you should be aware of what you\u2019ll be giving up, especially time.Those are the costs associated with running a Solana validator.Now onto the good stuff:Every validator has two major sources of income and a two (optional) ones depending on what client the validator is running.Solana runs native Delegated-POS so validators usually don\u2019t own all their stake. However, inflation rewards belong to stake owners, which means validators usually don\u2019t own most of the inflation rewards.Commission is the amount a validator charges delegators for its work.It can be any whole number from 0 to 100%.This commission is currently the primary source of income for small validators.Like I mentioned earlier, half of all transaction fees from blocks are burned; the other half belongs to the leader for the slot.Solana\u2019s native block builder (called the scheduler) is partially random. It isn\u2019t First-In, First-Out (FIFO), or even based on priority fees.Priority fees improve the chances of transaction inclusion but they don\u2019t control ordering. In essence, paying the highest priority fee doesn\u2019t mean your transaction will be processed first.Coupled with the naïve and extremely cheap fees, spamming proves more effective at landing transactions on Solana, especially time sensitive transactions like MEV capture.To put into perspective how bad this is, Jito estimates that 58% of blockspace was filled with failed arbitrage transactionsJitoLabs came up with a solution for this. I won\u2019t discuss how it works (you can find that here.)The important thing is running the JITO client will get you bribes for processing certain transactions.Since the JITO bribing arrangement is done off-chain, the bribes don\u2019t count as normal fees, so all the fees from MEV bribes belong to the validator.Those are the sources of income for a validator.A validator could choose to capture MEV for themselves but they\u2019d likely be blacklisted when discovered.So what does all that mean for profitability?The biggest problem with understanding validator economics is the number of variables.If I had to write an equation for profit, it would look like this:In said equation, the only constants are hardware and bandwidth costs and even those vary between providers and locations.The other components are harder to estimate:The point I\u2019m making is that it\u2019s hard to make any definitive projections on profitability so take these numbers with a heap of salt.At current market conditions, a private validator (100% commission) with average performance would need about 5100 SOL staked to break even.If you run the Jito client, you\u2019d need about 5,000 SOL.This, of course, does not account for intangibles like an entire year of your time, the opportunity cost of locking up your tokens, or any change in the variables.For validators with delegated stake, it\u2019s estimated that it would take about 80k SOL delegated at 5% commission for an average validator to break even today.You can use Cogent\u2019s Profit Calculator to play around with different variations to get an idea of how much stake it would take to break even under different conditions. It\u2019s an amazing tool.The key takeaway is if you can raise enough stake, you\u2019ll be profitable.But what does it take to raise stake and by extension run a profitable validator.As you can probably tell by now, running a profitable validator is a difficult and complex task. I think Italo\u2019s words describe it best.Putting setup aside, the big question is: how do you go about raising stake?Aside self-stake, there are four sources of stake on Solana: organic, stake pools, the Solana Foundation delegation program, and the Jito delegation program.Organic stake is getting Solana users to delegate to you directly. It\u2019s very difficult starting out since larger validators have more APY and are more trustworthy, but it\u2019s absolutely necessary for validators at all levels.2. Stake PoolsProtocols like Marinade and Blaze run stake pools. A stake pool collects tokens and uses an algorithm to delegate the tokens in a way that maximizes network decentralization and APY for users. This is how most validators get their start.3. Solana Foundation Delegation Program: The Solana Foundation also helps new validators by delegating some of its tokens to them. You could get over 100,000 SOL delegated to you if your validator meets the requirements. The Solana Foundation also temporarily covers voting costs for qualified validators. The only downside is the amount of time it takes to get into the program and KYC.4. Jito Delegation Program: Jito also runs a similar delegation program. You have to run the JITO client and share your MEV bribes with delegators. Aside that, it\u2019s essentially the same as the Solana Foundation\u2019s program (without the KYC.)These are the four sources of stake on Solana but knowing where to get stake is not enough; you need to know how to maximize your delegation.And it boils down to two things: uptime and decentralization.Uptime is the single most important consideration for a validator. Apart from directly affecting how much you earn (through credits), it also affects how likely you are to attract stake.Uptime affects earnings, and so it affects APY. Poor APY means you\u2019ll struggle to get organic stake. The other sources of stakealso have strict uptime criteria that can disqualify you from getting any delegation.Nothing else matters if your validator\u2019s uptime is below average.The second-most important factor is decentralization.Organic stake isn\u2019t affected by decentralization, but it\u2019s a major metric used by all other sources of stake.You\u2019re not going to get much delegation if you use a data center that already hosts 4 other validators somewhere in the EU. So you need to factor in what data center you\u2019ll be using and its location when you decide to set up your validator.There are subtle nuances for different delegation programs, but if you can optimize these two metrics, you could break even in two or three months without needing any stake from the foundation.So by now, you should have a good idea of how profitable running a validator is (in the short term) and what you can do to maximize it.An important follow-up question is: does it make sense long-term?The answer to that question is once again, hard to say.Long-term sustainability is an even more complex topic because the variables can vary wildly over a long time frame.So instead of trying (and failing) to predict how the price of SOL and blockspace demand will vary, I\u2019ll highlight a few developments that will significantly affect Solana\u2019s economic structure.This information in conjuction with what we\u2019ve already discussed should form the basis of your long-term outlook for running a validator.SIMD-0096 proposes that all of the priority fees be sent to the leader. It\u2019s been approved, and when it\u2019s implemented, validator economics will change significantly.Priority fees made up 92% of all non-vote fees in January.If the entirety of the priority fees are sent to the slot leader, it will increase income and reduce reliance on inflation for validators.In other words, validators will be able to do more with less stake.At the moment, Solana\u2019s transaction structure is naïve.Transactions are charged based on how many signatures they require, as opposed to how much computation they require.This structure causes a lot of problems that are better discussed here. All you need to know is that when the ongoing developments towards improving these are completed, votes will cost significantly less than most other transactions.There is also a push to reserve blockspace for votes.If votes have dedicated blockspace, there is less risk of votes being cannibalized by user transactions, so lesser fees are required and, by extension, lower voting costs.The scheduler is being worked on to increase the efficacy of priority fees.When these changes are effected, MEV capture will become easier, there will be a significant reduction in on-chain spam and priority fees should jump.According to Dune, 26% of ETH is staked. About 39% of this is done through liquid staking.On Solana, 67.3% is staked and only 5.1% (of the 67) is done through liquid staking.There are many possible reasons for this, with DeFi maturity being the most cited.The reason it\u2019s relevant is that as DeFi begins to mature on Solana, there will be a shift from native staking to liquid staking.This is good because two of the three biggest liquid staking protocols (Marinade and SolBlaze) actively prioritize decentralization.In other words, as the ecosystem matures, stake spread should improve and it should reduce the initial friction for beginner validators (provided they have good uptime and decentralization).SIMD-0033 is an approved proposal that will penalize late voting. It was proposed because some validators delayed their votes until after consensus was reached. This allowed them to maximize vote credits because they never voted wrong, but it slowed down consensus.With SIMD-0033, timeliness will affect the number of credits earned.I\u2019m mentioning this for two reasons:The effect of the launch of the Firedancer client is moot.It isn\u2019t going to directly increase the value of blockspace and could even theoretically reduce it. But if it really does 10x Solana\u2019s throughput, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind.Solana currently doesn\u2019t have programmatic slashing.In the event that a node is found to be acting maliciously, validators can decide to slash it, but there\u2019s currently no enshrined mechanism. Once implemented, validator behavior will change to adapt to it. It\u2019s hard to say how it\u2019ll affect validator economics, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind.So what does all this mean for sustainability?Overall, the incentives for validators are getting better and more equitable. Competition is definitely getting stiffer, but there\u2019s no reason why a good validator (high-uptime and decentralized) shouldn\u2019t be able to make profit in the near or far future.Running a Solana validator is expensive and time-consuming. But the network rewards validators that perform well and help improve network decentralization.If you fall into that category, you can quickly gather stake and break even.Even if you don\u2019t, running a Solana validator isn\u2019t a blackhole for money. Done right, you can break even quickly without needing any stake from the foundation. Long-term prospects are also bright and the initial friction can only get lower from here.In a nutshell, running a validator can be a profitable endeavor and isn\u2019t as inaccessible as it may initially seem.I hope this has answered all your questions.Links to the validator Discord, Solana Documentation and other helpful resources for those interested are in the next section.For those interested in running their own nodes:Solana Tech DiscordValidator DocumentationGetting Started as a Validator workshopJitoProposals to improve Solana\u2019s FTMSIMD-033 is briefly discussed hereSVM Execution Economics by TolyMany thanks to Cogent, Ferric, Trent.sol, Montchik, Dan Smith, Ryan Chern, Zantetsu (Shinobi Systems) and especially Italo Casas for all their help in creating this.Is it pretentious to acknowledge Toly?Italo runs the SolDev Validator; profits from the validator are used to fund onboarding new devs to Solana.

The market is again experiencing volatile sentiments due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving and confirmed rumors about the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.Old blockchains and coins in the cryptocurrency market have already been well-studied. We all know what BTC and Ethereum (ETH) are capable of and what to expect from their development plans in 2024. We know that in 2023, many new blockchains were launched, including WB Network and BASE.While headlines in 2023 were dominated by Layer 2 Ethereum, zero-knowledge proof, and Bitcoin\u2019s ordinal numbers, what significant stories can we expect to see in 2024?The rapid growth of Solana (SOL) towards the end of 2023, alongside the expansion of the Cosmos (ATOM) ecosystem through chains like Injective Protocol (INJ), suggests that the era of Ethereum dominance may be coming to an end.Despite the success of non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, smart contracts, and decentralized applications based on Ethereum continue to dominate, attracting the highest developer activity and Total Value Locked (TVL) statistics.While non-EVM chains will thrive, platforms that find ways to leverage Ethereum-based architecture will automatically gain good user adoption opportunities.Meanwhile, the gravitational pull of Bitcoin cannot be ignored. With only a few months left until the next halving and the countdown timer affirming the positive impact of approving a spot Bitcoin-ETF, things look promising for the king of digital assets.Bitcoin-Fi is already on the horizon, and tokens like Ordinals and BRC-20 may have just been the beginning. Let\u2019s now turn our attention to blockchain projects that deserve your consideration.In 2023, the focus on security increased, based on the report from SlowMist Technology\u2019s \u201CAnnual Report on Blockchain Security and Anti-Money Laundering for 2023.\u201DAccording to the data, a total of 464 security incidents occurred in 2023, resulting in losses of $2.486 billion. Compared to 2022, losses decreased by 34.2% on an annual basis.The cryptocurrency industry has experienced ups and downs amid a tumultuous \u201Ccrypto winter\u201D and bear market. Governments and international organizations have adopted a more cautious stance, and cryptocurrency regulation policies in various countries are still gradually taking shape.The attention of cybercriminals towards the crypto industry necessitates a diligent and careful approach to security measures. To minimize threats, users should:The cryptocurrency market is largely driven by speculation and hype. As a result, new and innovative protocols often outperform established platforms that we are already familiar with.At the same time, this excitement and speculation make these new crypto assets much more volatile and high-risk. They may not be suitable for low-risk investment strategies.Let\u2019s explore some of the most interesting and new blockchain projects that we can expect to see in 2024.Monad is a new Layer 1 blockchain that promises to deliver what any other Layer 1 blockchain promises. Like many others, it utilizes a Proof-of-Stake network, claiming greater scalability, security, and decentralization than its Web3 competitors.The main Celestia network, code-named Lemon Mint, was launched on October 31, 2023, successfully raising $55 million from venture capitalists, including Spartan Group, Jump Crypto, Blockchain Capital, and Polychain Capital.Functional compatibility has been one of the significant challenges facing cryptocurrency for many years. Connecting digital assets across chains can sometimes be a nightmare, associated with high fees, slippage costs, and a plethora of exploits and hacks.The Ordinals\u2019 protocol is a system for numbering satoshis, assigning a serial number to each satoshi and tracking them through transactions.In simpler terms, ordinals allow users to make individual satoshis unique by adding additional data to them. This process is known as \u201Cinscription.\u201DThe last on our list of blockchain projects to watch out for this year is NEON. It joins our list of new and exciting blockchain protocols to watch in 2024. NEON EVM is a unique network aiming to give us the best of both worlds and permanently dispel Layer 1 maximalism.The cryptocurrency landscape is poised for new developments and challenges, fueled by anticipation surrounding the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF, technological advancements, and the evolution of groundbreaking projects.Blockchain projects are increasingly prioritizing security, employing new protection methods, and creating secure spaces for users\u2019 cryptocurrencies.Staying informed about intriguing new blockchain projects in the crypto space is a good way to stay ahead and learn about innovations before they become mainstream, ensuring users navigate the dynamic crypto environment with confidence.>Free Tool: Use our simple crypto profit calculator to calculate your potential profits and returns on your cryptocurrency investments.<<<Disclaimer: This article is meant for educational purposes and should not be taken as investment advice.

It is at once crypto\u2019s biggest selling point, going hand in hand with the principles of decentralization, anonymity, and trustlessness, and its biggest pain point, with excruciating KYCs, easily trackable PII, and an ever-suspicious gaze from the outside world.Unfortunately, this is also a topic that is largely misunderstood and misconceived, with many people viewing crypto \u201Cprivacy\u201D as simply an excuse to finance terrorists and conduct money laundering. The fact that crypto Twitter prides itself for its \u201Canon culture\u201D and that mainstream media often (intentionally or unintentionally) reinforces these biases doesn\u2019t help a case in dissolving these stereotypes.Because Web3 privacy is such an all-encompassing concept, touching upon everything from ape profile pictures to cryptography and Zero Knowledge Proofs, its useless to talk about it in the aggregate, and make lump-sum judgements on whether it is good or bad. Instead, we must break down the problem into different smaller segments. In this essay, I will first break down and analyze Web3\u2019s \u201Cprivacy\u201D infrastructure at three distinct levels \u2014 network level privacy, protocol level privacy, and user level privacy \u2014 before exploring the role that technological solutions such as Zero Knowledge Proofs play in the future of Web3 privacy.The first and oldest conception of privacy is at the network level. Network level privacy is where every transaction of a cryptocurrency on a given blockchain network is guaranteed privacy through underlying consensus mechanisms of the blockchain and network-level design choices. As such, these are also called \u201Cprivacy coins.\u201DThis conception of privacy traces its roots all the way back to the Bitcoin protocol, and its idea of anonymizing \u201Cwallet addresses\u201D as 160-bit cryptographic hashes [1]. While Bitcoin itself has fully transparent transactions, where any user can inspect any transaction on its network, Bitcoin\u2019s design principles of decentralization and anonymity have undoubtedly inspired the driving force behind the development of \u201Cnetwork level privacy\u201D and privacy-first blockchains.One of the leading projects in establishing network level privacy is Monero, a privacy-first blockchain established in 2014. Unlike Bitcoin, Monero hides both user wallets and transactions behind \u201CRing Signatures,\u201D in which users within a given \u201Cring\u201D have access to a certain group signature, and use that group signature to sign transactions. Therefore, for any given transaction on the Monero network, you can only tell that it comes from a certain group, but you don\u2019t know which user in that group actually signed the transaction. In essence, this is a form of \u201Cprivacy in the crowd,\u201D in which users band together into groups in order to provide everyone with privacy. [2]Another project that tackles this same space is ZCash, an early pioneer of a form of Zero Knowledge Proofs called zk-SNARKs which has been recently popularized. The fundamental concept behind Zero Knowledge Proofs is that it is a way of proving something is true without revealing any further information (which could compromise security and privacy) [4].A simple example of a Zero Knowledge Proof is a Gradescope autograder [5]. You need to \u201Cprove\u201D that you did your CS homework correctly, but don\u2019t need to tell the autograder any further details about your code implementation. Instead, the autograder checks your \u201Cknowledge\u201D through running a bunch of hidden test cases, and your code must match the \u201Cexpected\u201D output of the Gradescope autograder. Through matching the \u201Cexpected\u201D output, you can provide a Zero Knowledge Proof that you\u2019ve done your homework without showing your actual code implementation.In the case of ZCash, while transactions are by default transparent, users can choose to use these \u201CZero Knowledge Proofs\u201D to create private transactions. When a user wants to send a transaction, they create a transaction message that includes the sender\u2019s public address, the recipient\u2019s public address, and the amount of the transaction, and then convert this into a zk-SNARK proof, which is the only thing sent to the network. This zk-SNARK proof contains all the necessary information to prove the validity of the transaction, but doesn\u2019t reveal any of the details of the transaction itself. This means that the network can validate the transaction without knowing who sent it, who received it, or the amount involved.Despite their design and implementation differences, for both Monero and ZCash the transaction privacy is guaranteed at the blockchain level, such that all transactions happening on the network are automatically guaranteed to be private. This privacy guarantee can be easily abused by bad actors to conduct money laundering, terrorist activities, and drug trafficking, and Monero is particularly notorious for its popularity on the Dark Web [6]. Furthermore, as Monero and other \u201Cprivacy coins\u201D become synonymous with illicit financial activities, this drives away users using these \u201Cprivacy coins\u201D out of legitimate privacy concerns, feeding a negative feedback loop that only results in a more harmful shadow economy.This is the biggest drawback of guaranteeing privacy at the network level: it is an \u201Call or nothing\u201D approach in design, where there is a zero-sum tradeoff between the transparency of a transaction versus the privacy of this transaction. It is precisely because of this lack of transparency that \u201Cnetwork level privacy\u201D draws the most ire from regulators, and the reason why several major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Huobi have delisted Monero, ZCash, and other privacy coins in several jurisdictions [7].A different approach to privacy is to ensure \u201Cprotocol level privacy,\u201D where instead of hardcoding private transactions into the consensus level of the blockchain network, we process private transactions on a \u201Cprotocol\u201D or an \u201Capplication\u201D that runs on top of a blockchain network.Because early blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin, had limited programmability, building \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D was incredibly hard to do, and it was much easier to fork the Bitcoin network and implement privacy from the ground up in the form of a new blockchain and \u201Cprivacy coin.\u201D But with the advent of Ethereum and the rise of \u201Csmart contracts,\u201D this opened a whole new avenue for privacy-preserving protocols.One of the most notable examples of \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D is Tornado Cash, which is a decentralized application (dApp) on Ethereum that \u201Cmixes\u201D transactions together into a pool in order to guarantee transaction privacy \u2014 conceptually somewhat similar to Monero\u2019s \u201Cblend in with the crowd\u201D approach.The Tornado Cash protocol roughly speaking has three main steps:Unfortunately, in August 2022, Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US government, as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) alleged that North Korean hackers were using the protocol to launder stolen funds [10]. As a result of this crackdown, US users, companies, and networks are no longer able to use Tornado Cash. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle went a step further, freezing over $75,000 worth of funds connected to Tornado Cash addresses, and GitHub deleted the accounts of Tornado Cash developers [11].This triggered a controversial storm in the crypto sphere, as many argued that with the vast majority of users using Tornado Cash for legitimate privacy-preserving transactions, and that protocol users should not be punished for the bad actions of a small minority. But importantly, because Tornado Cash is a \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D on Ethereum, rather than a \u201Cnetwork level privacy\u201D solution, the crackdown and fallout was restricted only to this one protocol on the Ethereum network rather than affecting the entire network \u2014 unlike Monero and ZCash, Ethereum didn\u2019t get delisted from Coinbase because of these sanctions.An alternate approach to \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D pioneered by the Aztec Network focuses on \u201Crollups\u201D to shield user funds and support private transactions. Aztec\u2019s primary product is zk.money, which uses a 2-layer deep recursive Zero Knowledge Proof for both scaling and privacy. The first ZKP proves the correctness of the shielded transaction, ensuring that the transaction was in fact private and there was no informational leak. The second ZKP is used for the rollup itself, in order to bundle the computation of batches of transactions together and ensure that all of these were executed correctly [12].While rollup-based \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D solutions are still in their early stages, they represent the next evolution of \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D solutions. One key advantage of rollup solutions over dApp-based \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D solutions such as Tornado Cash, such as their enhanced scalability, as the heavy-lifting of the computation largely happens off-chain. Furthermore, because much rollup research has been focused solely on increasing computation, there is still ample space for exploration in applying and extending these technologies into the privacy sphere.A third (and most recent) approach to conceptualizing privacy in Web3 is through exploring \u201Cuser level privacy,\u201D where privacy guarantees are made for an individual user\u2019s data rather than focusing on the data of the user\u2019s transaction. In both the \u201Cnetwork\u201D and \u201Cprotocol\u201D level, we witness the recurring problem of a minority of bad actors (such as Dark Web transactions and money laundering schemes) affecting the use of the network and protocol for the innocent majority that are simply concerned for their personal data privacy.The crucial point of \u201Cuser level privacy\u201D is that through focusing on individual users of a network itself, we conduct a \u201Ctargeted\u201D form of filtering where benign users and addresses are free to interact with the blockchain network privately, while bad users can be quickly filtered out. As you can imagine, this is a Herculean task, walking a fine line between transparency and privacy. This user-centric view of privacy also spawns an entire debate (and industry) about the role and future of decentralized identity (dID) adjacent and derived from the question of Web3 privacy [13]. For the sake of brevity, I will not discuss this question of KYC and authentication in Web3.The core insight of \u201Cuser level privacy\u201D is to separate and reimagine the relationship between the user themselves and their wallet addresses on-chain, as wallet addresses are the atomic identifiers on a blockchain network. Importantly, there is a one-to-many mapping from users to chains: users often control more than one wallet address on each blockchain network they interact with. This is the idea of \u201Con-chain identity fragmentation.\u201D Thus, the crux of \u201Cuser level privacy\u201D is finding a secure way of mapping users\u2019 personally identifiable information (PII) to all these fragmented on-chain identities.A key project in this regard is Notebook Labs, which seeks to use Zero Knowledge Proofs to link fragmented identities together with a user\u2019s PII [14], while providing the following guarantees:While the cryptographic specifics of the protocol are beyond the scope of this essay, Notebook Labs demonstrates two core principles of \u201Cuser level privacy\u201D \u2014 the importance of addressing reimagining the relationship between the multitude of fragmented on-chain identities with real-world human users, as well as important role that Zero Knowledge Proofs play in aggregating and linking together all of these identities [16].Another emerging solution to the question of \u201Cuser level privacy\u201D is the idea of \u201Cstealth wallets.\u201D Again, the idea of \u201Cstealth wallets\u201D capitalizes on the fragmentation of on-chain identities, using the fact that a user typically has more than one identity on-chain. Unlike Tornado Cash and other \u201Cprotocol level privacy\u201D solutions, which seek to obscure the transaction data itself, stealth addresses seek to obscure who the real people are behind the sender and recipient addresses. This is implemented through essentially finding an algorithm to quickly and automatically generate \u201Cone-time wallets\u201D for a user\u2019s transaction [17].One important conceptual difference between \u201Cstealth wallets\u201D and previously discussed privacy solutions such as Monero and Tornado Cash is that this is not a form of \u201Cprivacy in the crowd.\u201D This means that unlike Tornado Cash, which can only make privacy guarantees for mainstream token transfers such as ETH, stealth wallets can also provide security guarantees for niche tokens and NFTs, or unique on-chain assets that have no \u201Ccrowd\u201D to blend into [17]. Nonetheless, thus far the discussion of \u201Cstealth wallets\u201D on Ethereum has remained at the theoretical stage, and the implementation effectiveness and legal repercussions of this novel technological solution are yet to be seen.As we can see, privacy is complicated in Web3. Different approaches to the problem \u2014 at the network level, at the protocol level, and at the user level \u2014 invite different solutions to it, and explore different tradeoffs between transparency and privacy. That said, any discussion of privacy is incomplete without considering the flip side of the coin: transparency and accountability.For better or for worse, regulators are right in saying that there needs to be a greater accountability in cryptocurrency transactions. Bad actors engaged in money laundering, terrorist activities, and financial fraud should be held accountable, regardless of whether they use fiat or crypto to complete their transactions. But hopefully, in Web3 this accountability can be achieved without governments resorting to shutting off privacy networks altogether and forcing people to use these blockchains \u201Ccryptographically naked.\u201D Privacy should be seen as a basic right, and a measure of digital dignity.For a long time, privacy and accountability were seen as a zero-sum game, where you could either hide your data and have privacy, or show your data and have transparency. The innovativeness of Web3 comes in its pioneering of elegant technological solutions, especially Zero Knowledge Proofs, to overcome this zero-sum dilemma. But the burden is on the Web3 community, not regulatory agencies, to show that these technologies can actually work in ensuring both privacy and accountability.Far too often, Zero Knowledge Proofs are touted as the end-all-be-all for any privacy problem. But despite all their mathematical magic, ZKPs are far from being a panacea for all of Web3\u2019s privacy concerns and have several critical drawbacks. Firstly, ZKPs are often highly specialized circuits used to prove a certain piece of information structured in a particular way. In general, they suffer from a lack of scalability and compatibility. Secondly, they are very expensive to create, run, and maintain, requiring orders of magnitude more of computation power than an equivalent non-ZKP program.Thus, when thinking about ZKPs in the realm of privacy, the important question will always be \u201Cwhat\u201D are you going to prove, and \u201Cwhy\u201D? After all, there\u2019s no free lunch, and designing a ZKP always will always come with a cost. It is just as irresponsible for tech evangelists to declare that ZKPs will solve everything in privacy as it is for regulators to shut down all privacy protocols.Fundamentally, privacy in Web3 is not just an engineering question; it\u2019s a first principles one. Ever since the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper and the commercial adoption of the blockchain, one of the foundational principles of Web3 is its emphasis on trustlessness \u2014 where you don\u2019t need to trust information to any party that could potentially turn that trust against you. A network can only truly be trustless when its users\u2019 privacy is guaranteed through a decentralized, transparent, and unbiased manner.So what should privacy look like in Web3? That\u2019s the most pressing question for us to decide.🐦 @0xfishylosopher📅 25 February 2023[1] https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/protect-your-privacy[2] https:\/\/decrypt.co\/resources\/monero[3] https:\/\/blog.pantherprotocol.io\/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies\/[4] https:\/\/z.cash\/technology\/zksnarks\/[5] The Gradescope example is from one of my previous blog posts, which discusses the principles of ZKPs (and zk-Sync v2.0) in more depth: https:\/\/medium.com\/web3-insights\/zk-sync-v2-0-and-the-future-of-zk-rollups-2d9617d5193b[6] https:\/\/dailycoin.com\/monero-xmr-darknet-darling\/[7] https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchsecurity\/news\/252512394\/Monero-and-the-complicated-world-of-privacy-coins[8] https:\/\/messari.vercel.app\/article\/on-chain-privacy[9] https:\/\/www.coincenter.org\/education\/advanced-topics\/how-does-tornado-cash-work\/[10] https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy0916[11] https:\/\/time.com\/6205143\/tornado-cash-us-crypto-ban\/[12] See more: https:\/\/zk.money\/[13] See more about dID: https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/decentralized-identity\/[14] https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/10\/27\/bain-capital-crypto-leads-33m-round-for-privacy-focused-identity-protocol\/[15] Notebook Labs Whitepaper: https:\/\/assets.website-files.com\/635b21dddd46c8cddf2171fd\/635b21dddd46c8be9021722c_Notebook_Whitepaper.pdf[16] https:\/\/securityboulevard.com\/2022\/09\/y-combinators-summer-2022-cybersecurity-privacy-and-trust-startups\/[17] Technical discussion of \u201Cstealth wallets\u201D omitted here for simplicity.

This collaboration aims to improve Ritual\u2019s Infernet and blockchain infrastructure, while at the same time opening up new AI-native opportunities for operators on EigenLayer.To run a Ritual Node effectively, we\u2019ll need:To get started with installing your node, you\u2019ll first need to rent a VPS (Virtual Private Server). Using a VPS offers several advantages, such as enhanced performance, scalability and reliability. I\u2019ll guide you through the process of renting a VPS at a lower cost, and show you how to configure it. Follow the steps below to get your VPS ready for the node installation. Research VPS providers: Take some time to explore different VPS providers available in the market. Consider factors like pricing, reputation, and customer reviews to find the right fit for your needs. Look for plans that offer the appropriate amount of resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to support your node. Contabo is my preferred choice due to their combination of affordable pricing, reliable performance, and user-friendly interface.I personally use and trust Contabo for my blockchain nodes. I\u2019ve recently joined their affiliate program to recommend their services. If you decide to use my affiliate links for Contabo, you\u2019ll be supporting my work at no extra cost to you. This support is important for continuing our journey together in the fascinating world of crypto, and using these affiliate links is a direct and impactful way to back my efforts. Thank you very much for your support!Minimum and recommended hardware specifications needed for this node:In setting up the node, we\u2019ll follow the recommended hardware guidelines and choose the Cloud VPS 2 package.I will initially select a rental period of 1 month, with the flexibility to extend it later if needed:Make sure to choose the option \u201CEuropean Union (Germany)\u201D:For the best storage solution, I recommend selecting the 400GB SSD storage type.To access Docker with Ubuntu 22.04, navigate to the \u201CApps & Panels\u201D section and make the appropriate selection:To prioritize security, I highly recommend to generate a password and securely store it to ensure maximum protection:For the final step, it\u2019s recommended to leave the sections titled \u201CObject Storage\u201D, \u201CNetworking\u201D, and \u201CAdd-Ons\u201D in their default state without any modifications. If you are new to Contabo, please create an account; otherwise, login using your existing credentials. Provide your personal data by filling in the required fields. Complete the remaining fields with your personal information, and click the \u201CNext\u201D button to proceed with the payment. After successfully completing the payment for your order, you will receive an initial email. Within approximately 15 minutes, you will receive a second email containing all the information needed to connect to your VPS.Download and install most recent edition of PuTTY by visiting the official website:You will find the IP adress of your VPS in the second email. Launch PuTTY, enter the IP address of your VPS and click \u201COpen\u201D:Once the server interface is open, you will be prompted to provide login details; simply enter \u201Croot\u201D as the user and use your chosen password:Congratulations! You are now successfully logged into your server:To continue, we can update the packages by running the following commands in the terminal. The first part of the command (sudo apt update) updates the package lists for upgrades, and the second part (sudo apt upgrade -y) actually performs the upgrades with the \u201C-y\u201D flag allowing for automatic confirmation of prompts during the upgrade process:In this step, we\u2019re preparing the system by installing essential build tools. Specifically, curl and git are used for downloading and managing code repositories, jq for processing JSON data, lz4 for compression and decompression, and build-essential for compiling software from source.Let\u2019s now install Docker, this process will take a few minutes:Once the installation is complete, verify the version using the following command. The Docker version should be a minimum of 24.0.5.Next, let\u2019s proceed with the installation of Docker Compose. Make sure to verify their GitHub repository for the most recent release and adjust the version and accordingly in this command:Use chmod to change the permissions of the Docker Compose directory:Verify the Docker Compose version; it should be at least v2.24.5:To set up and test the Web3 workflow with the Infernet Node, we\u2019ll go through several steps including deploying a node with Infernet SDK contracts and deploying a simple consumer contract for our Web3 demo. After establishing this infrastructure, we\u2019ll make a subscription request through our consumer contract to create an on-chain subscription. This process allows us to monitor the entire lifecycle of the subscription, from the node receiving the subscription event to processing it and finally sending the result back to the consumer contract on-chain. We begin by cloning the starter repository to our local machine and navigating to it, which is the foundation for deploying and testing the components:To ensure your Docker container continues running even if your VPS connection is lost, start a new screen session named \u201Critual\u201D (or any name you prefer) using this command:Inside this screen session, you set up the hello-world project and all necessary services. We\u2019ll use a single command that initiates the deployment process:We can now exit the session with CTRL + A + D, to detach from screen without disturbing it. To re-enter your session, you can use the screen -ls command to list all the detached (running) screens along with their respective screen IDs. The result will look like this:To connect or attach to a specific running screen, you can use the following command: screen -x [screen id], replacing [screen id] with the screen ID obtained from the output of the previous command, like this:It\u2019s important to be familiar with these screen commands to avoid accidentally starting multiple screen sessions running the same tasks:After executing the deployment command and detaching from the screen session, we\u2019ll verify the operation by opening a second terminal window to list all active Docker containers. This step requires establishing a new SSH connection to your VPS, which is basically the same process as in Step 2, ensuring you can monitor and manage the deployment process effectively:The output should look like this:To update your config.json file, open it in your second terminal window using the nano editor with this command:Please update the following in your configuration file:Your configuration file should look like this:After editing, save and close the file. If you\u2019re using nano, you can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y to confirm the changes, and Enter to exitTo obtain your private key, it\u2019s important to follow a secure process. The official MetaMask documentation provides a detailed guide on how to safely access your private key within the MetaMask wallet.In the final step, we need to adjust the following settings before we can initialize the new configuration.2. Update the Deployment Script: Go to the deployment script located at projects\/hello-world\/contracts\/script\/Deploy.s.sol. Use the following command to open the script for editing:These changes will ensure your project\u2019s settings are updated with the correct network and wallet details.To apply your new configuration, including the updated wallet, restart the Docker container one by one in your second terminal session using these commands:Then, verify the restart by listing all running Docker containers using docker ps. Finally, to ensure your changes are active, use this command:Make sure to replace <CONTAINER ID> with the actual ID of the \"deploy-node-1\" container obtained from the docker ps command, like this:Once you restart the \u201Cdeploy-node-1\u201D container, the logs should now display your your wallet details.Inside the second terminal window we just started, we will now install Foundry which is a portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust, using these commands:Next, it\u2019s important to install the necessary dependencies to ensure smooth integration and deployment. This process involves navigating into the contract\u2019s directory and installing required libraries and SDKs, using these commands:Monitoring the Anvil node\u2019s logs during this process is beneficial to understand the deployment\u2019s progress. For this, open a third terminal window and use the following command:Now, we\u2019ll finally deploy a consumer contract designed to interact with the Infernet SDK. The example provided by the Ritual Team, a \u201CSaysGM\u201D contract, is straightforward: it requests a compute output from an Infernet Node and prints the result using the forge console. To deploy this contract, go back to your second terminal session and execute these commands:In the last step, you should switch to your third terminal window again where you\u2019re monitoring the Anvil node. Look for a new transaction in the logs. If everything is set up correctly, you will notice a transaction indicating that your deployment and interactions with the blockchain are successful.Next, initiate a request to the Infernet Node by executing the following command in your second terminal session (= in the same session where you also deployed the SaysGM contract):This action will trigger an initiation transaction directed at the SaysGm contract, indicating the start of your contract interaction. Now, switch back to your third terminal window where you\u2019re monitoring the Anvil node and look for a new message confirming the transaction, which signifies that your contract interaction has successfully initiated:Shortly after, you should see another transaction from the Infernet Node. This transaction represents the outcome of your on-chain subscription and its corresponding job request, completing the cycle of interaction with the blockchain and demonstrating the node\u2019s processing capabilities.To register and activate your node on the Coordinator contract (0x8d871ef2826ac9001fb2e33fdd6379b6aabf449c) via Basescan, first, make sure you\u2019re using the same Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) connected to your config.json file. For registration, input your wallet\u2019s public address into the \u201Cnode (address)\u201D field of the \u201CregisterNode\u201D function and confirm the transaction. After waiting for 1 hour, proceed to activate your node using the \u201CactivateNode\u201D function. This process is important for integrating your node with the network.If the process is successful, you should be able to verify two transactions linked to your wallet on the Basescan explorer: one confirming the registration of your node and the other its activation.To ensure there are no errors across all Docker containers, you can check their logs with the following command. This step is important for identifying and resolving any potential issues that might be affecting your setup:Congratulations!

If you are interested in enabling a chain abstraction experience for your users, we are now onboarding a limited number of wallets and applications!With the surge in the number of rollups and chains, users need chain abstraction more than ever. In our previous blog post, we discussed the essence of chain abstraction and why current attempts at chain abstraction are incapable of meeting user needs. Orby is our answer to Chain Abstraction.Orby is a single integration that allows every wallet and application to enable chain abstraction. Upon integration, users can simply pull out their wallets, connect to applications anywhere, and seamlessly use all their assets everywhere to interact anywhere onchain. Users no longer need to understand the intricacies of different chains, tokens, and virtual machines. Nor learn new tools, onboard to new systems, or actively migrate assets to various chains.The below demo shows a chain-abstracted experience using an Orby-powered fork of Rainbow Wallet on Uniswap: A user who has 20 USDC on Ethereum, 6 USDC on Optimism, and 4 USDC on Arbitrum can now connect their wallet to Uniswap and swap for $30 worth of WETH on Base in one click.Orby is designed to maximize compatibility with the existing system and minimize the need for drastic changes to existing user behavior. Orby does not require the use of a new chain, account system, or token standard. It is just a simple integration that removes complexity from an already complicated system. Developers who want to enable chain abstraction can access Orby through the OrbyEngine or the OrbyKit.OrbyEngine is a Smart RPC endpoint that connects to all chains, unifies accounts, and formulates intents to fill in the gaps for user wants. In other words, users make requests, and OrbyEngine figures out how to make them succeed. This process of filling in gaps and figuring things out encompasses many things, including but not limited to:OrbyEngine supports all account types (i.e., External-Owned Accounts, Smart Contract Accounts), and account set-ups (i.e., embedded accounts, MPC wallets, etc.). Unlike other attempts at chain abstraction, it does not require an overhaul of the entire blockchain stack. It also does not require users to move to a new account system or migrate their assets, thereby minimizing the barrier to adoption. All it takes to integrate the OrbyEngine is to swap out your RPC endpoint and change a few RPC calls. For most developers, this is no more than a day\u2019s worth of work.OrbyKit is a Chain Abstraction SDK designed to channel the powers of Orby to applications. It is a frontend integration that allows applications to provide a native chain-abstracted experience to their users, regardless of their wallet.OrbyKit:We are onboarding a limited number of wallets and applications to be the first to offer chain abstraction to their users.

We\u2019re thrilled to be able to offer our community a chance to claim their share of this massive AI infrastructure play (with lucrative token rewards attached)!So what exactly does purchasing a Rivalz node license actually get you? And how can you best monetize it to your advantage?Today we\u2019ll be breaking down the answers to those questions into the simplest possible terms, as well as giving you the lowdown on all the innovative tech that Rivalz are building.We\u2019ll start with\u2026Let\u2019s cover the most important question first: what exactly are you buying when you participate in a node sale? Well, here\u2019s the simplest answer possible: a node license is an NFT which allows you to generate passive income.If we want to get a little more complex: a node license is an NFT which gives you the right to run a node on the Rivalz blockchain. Rivalz validator nodes (zNodes) are the building blocks of the network, which control the authentication and flow of data throughout the ecosystem. As a reward for this service to the network, zNode operators get paid out fees in the form of $RIZ tokens.A full 20% of the total supply is set aside to be distributed to zNode operators across the first 2.5 years after TGE. That means that \u2014 following the mainnet launch in Q3 2024 \u2014 each zNode will generate passive income for a full 30 months. Further rewards will be paid out after this first rewards pool is exhausted.To sweeten the deal even further, a further 2% of $RIZ supply will be airdropped to node sale participants directly at TGE, with 100% unlock!Although the language surrounding nodes might at times sound complicated, actually running a node doesn\u2019t have to be complex. You can simply delegate your node to a third-party node operator service, who will run it for you (for a portion of the fees). Rivalz is partnering with multiple of these service providers to support one-click deployment.Closer to the launch of the mainnet in Q3, we will provide a simple guide on how to go about setting up your node through these service providers (along with a guide on how to run the nodes directly on your own hardware, if you\u2019d prefer to do so).To recap:Now let\u2019s take a deeper look at the nuts and bolts of what Rivalz are actually building: a network for the storage and interchange of data for AI systems. To understand the significance of this mission, we should address the problem they\u2019ve set out to solve.When AI developers build applications, they need access to large datasets in order to generate reliable results. As things stand, the sources of this data are often fragmented, incomplete, or even unethically sourced.Rivalz aims to use the power of decentralized computing to intelligently collate, clean, and index this data into a brand new type of reliable and transparent source: a decentralized, cross-chain hub where AI applications can tap into vast and dependable data resources. This is why they call themselves the \u2018first AI intel layer\u2019 in Web3.This streamlined AI infrastructure can then be used to power myriad kinds of AI-powered applications: AI agents, trading bots, GameFi projects, DeFi protocols \u2014 essentially any project which seeks to implement AI in its tech stands to benefit from integration with the Rivalz data infrastructure.The Rivalz network is made up of two main layers. The first is the Rivalz RollApp \u2014 this is essentially an EVM compatible blockchain, built for plug-and-play access to the Rivalz data infrastructure. Here developers can build and integrate their AI-powered DApps, and connect them cross-chain through the power of EVM interoperability.The second layer is the Rivalz DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure network). Simply put, this is the decentralized network made up of every device around the world running a Rivalz node. It\u2019s here that the data inputted into the network is validated, streamlined, cataloged, stored, and managed.Rivalz nodes are responsible for all of the above processes, as well as controlling the inflow and outflow of information between the DePIN layer and apps built on the RollApp. This is what you\u2019ll be contributing to when you buy and run a node through Samurai Starter!On the Rivalz DePIN storage layer, zNodes (validator nodes) handle the authentication and secure processing of data flowing in and out of the storage layer. These are the backbone of the whole decentralized infrastructure, and receive a high rate of $RIZ reward emissions as a result \u2014 as we mentioned before, 20% of total supply paid out over 30 months, with 2% of the supply airdropped at TGE.That\u2019s why node licenses are required to run a zNode, and why demand for them is so strong. These licenses are non-transferrable for the first year, after which they can be freely traded (although with the rewards on offer, we\u2019re not sure why you\u2019d want to!).Besides those, the Rivalz network also features rNodes (worker nodes) which provide the actual data storage space for the network. These don\u2019t require a node license to run, but pay out a much lower level of rewards as a result.The programmability and inter-chain compatibility of the Rivalz RollApp means that developers will be able to build their tech directly on top of the protocol in order to access its AI data infrastructure. To showcase the power and potential of this system, Rivalz are also developing their own pair of flagship applications which harness the power of their DePIN system.The first is Agentz: a \u2018cross-chain infrastructure AI agent hub\u2019 which enables intelligent programs such as AI trading bots to access the datasets of the Rivalz DePIN storage layer, and operate cross-chain through integration with the Axelar Network.The second is Clonez: the platform where users can \u2018license themselves to the world of AI\u2019 by consensually submitting personal data through the platform (including even their voice or likeness), to be indexed on the Rivalz DePIN. AI firms will then be able to license this data from a central marketplace, with users receiving payouts whenever their information is used.In future, each of these flagship Rivalz DApps will get its own deep dive. For now, suffice to say we\u2019re excited about the possibilities that their platform opens up for the next wave of innovative AI-powered applications!The $RIZ token is the native utility token of the Rivalz network. It will be used for transaction fees on the network, paying out rewards to node operators, and be integrated with DApps building on top of the Rivalz RollApp.The token will go live with the launch of the mainnet in Q3 2024, at which point every node license holder will receive a share of 2% of the total $RIZ supply airdropped to their wallets. This airdrop will be 100% unlocked from day one!Rewards for node operators will also be paid out using the token, in the form of $sRIZ (staked RIZ). When claiming their rewards, operators will be able to choose a vesting schedule of 60, 90, or 120 days for their tokens \u2014 with greater payouts for longer vesting.Aside from the $RIZ token, zNode operators will also enjoy airdrops from partner projects which build on top of the Rivalz network in future, meaning potential exposure to a wide range of innovative AI projects in the months and years to come.Now that you understand why Rivalz is such a strong AI infrastructure play, let\u2019s dive into the details on how to get involved\u2026Node sales are structured a little differently to standard IDOs, with multiple different price tiers offered. This pricing structure means that those who get in early enjoy the best prices, while latecomers are forced to FOMO in at a much higher cost.The total supply of Rivalz node licenses is 68,000. These are split across 20 tiers, each with a different price. However, regardless of price, all node licenses are exactly the same. You can see the breakdown of the price tiers for the entire campaign here:We at Samurai Starter have been able to secure 400 node licenses for our community at great prices: 200 at Tier 3 and 200 at Tier 4. On top of that, we\u2019ve even managed to secure a 10% discount on the listed prices!This means that we\u2019ll be offering 200 nodes at $536 and a further 200 nodes at $616 \u2014 some of the best prices possible.These two different price points mean that those who participate fastest will enjoy the best prices. Read on to make sure you don\u2019t miss out\u2026We\u2019ll be splitting the sale into two rounds. These will be similar to the \u2018guaranteed\u2019 and \u2018FCFS\u2019 rounds from previous sales.For details on the total number of nodes each person can buy in each round, check this quick reference chart:Both price tiers of zNode will be available to buy from the start of Round 1 on a FCFS basis. On the launchpad page, you\u2019ll be able to select the number of nodes you wish to purchase at each price point, and the system will automatically calculate how much USDC to charge.Those who participate the fastest will be able to secure their nodes at the cheaper price point. Once those cheaper nodes are sold out, their input box will be greyed out.You\u2019ll be able to participate in this sale much like any other raise on Samurai Starter:It\u2019s that simple. However, remember that you\u2019ll need to be quick on the trigger: the first 50% of participants will enjoy a cheaper price!And that\u2019s really all there is to it . Now you have a solid understanding of what Rivalz is all about, the value of their zNodes, and how to get your hands on them during our sale.We could spend 10,000 more words diving deeper and deeper into the Rivalz tech \u2014 we\u2019ve really only scratched the surface today!

But you can only initiate a send by authenticating (or signing) the private key, which you alone posses.This top level of wallet ownership is also known as an Externally Owned Account (EOA).One common form of AA gives the user the option to save their private key in the cloud and authenticate it with a username and password.Some may quibble over whether this even qualifies as AA. I would argue that it does in the sense that it removes the need to write down and secure a seedphrase and gives the user a familiar pattern with which to authenticate and recover their private key.A much more sophisticated approach I\u2019m seeing more and more is to leverage a technology called Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS).Using this method, the private key is broken up into multiple \u201Ckey shares,\u201D a certain threshold of which (usually two of three) must be authenticated to reconstitute the whole private key.These wallets represent a few different form factors and common wallet categories.Argent is a mobile app wallet available on iOS and Android, primarily for saving and long term storage of crypto assets.The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Wallet is a browser extension that facilitates access to the Binance Smart Chain and the dapps in that ecosystem.Sequence is a web wallet that supports multiple chains and is purpose built for gaming.With Argent, you have two options for private key management:Option 1\u2014 Save your private key to your iCloud key chain and authenticate with biometrics or PIN.This is very convenient, but if you decide to go this route your private key is stored with Apple and is vulnerable to all the same security weaknesses as your iCloud account.Because of this, iCloud has become a much bigger target for hackers. This guy lost $650,000 in a pretty crude fishing attack because he saved his private key to iCloud.Your privacy is also compromised, in the sense that all the personally identifying information associated with your iCloud account is now associated with your private key. If you use biometrics, you might as well have a DNA sample attached to your private key.Your iCloud and biometrics can also be compelled, just like your blood can be compelled if you are pulled over for a DUI.Raw numbers on the other hand (which is what a private key is) and a combination of words (mnemonic seedphrase) cannot be compelled, and they contain no personal identifying information.Option 2\u2014 Use SSS to break your private key into three or more key shares and save them amongst several guardians.You can use any or all of these entities as guardians:This is perhaps the least bad implementation I\u2019ve seen of v2 account abstraction.Setup takes significantly more effort than iCloud, but you can configure it in a way that is both private and trustless, so long as you use anonymous guardians (like hardware wallets) and you don\u2019t use Argent\u2019s guardian.You can assign as many guardians as you like and define your own threshold, like two of three, three of five or six of ten.I would say the main drawback of using Argent in this way is that unfortunately, the wallet you create isn\u2019t compatible with any other non custodial wallets that use normal wallet standards.Meaning that if you were to store your savings on Argent, go into a coma for 30 years, then come back and try to restore your wallet, you better hope that Argent didn\u2019t run out of VC money and go under, and that the guardian configuration still works exactly the way it did when you created your account.Otherwise you\u2019re SOL. There is no other wallet that facilitates the authentication of key shares and reconstitutes the private key exactly like Argent.Funny enough, Argent also lets you export your seedphrase from settings. If you do that, the seedphrase would be compatible with other BIP-39 standard wallets, but anyone who has the seedphrase can completely bypass the guardians you set up using SSS.The Argent team has empowered users by giving them a ton of options to roll their own custody setup, which I can appreciate.It\u2019s up to individuals to identify the tradeoffs and decide what is the best solution for them.Similar to Argent, Binance Smart Chain Wallet (BSC) gives users the option to save their private key to Google Cloud, or to secure it via SSS.Guardians are called \u201Cauthentication factors\u201D and they work the same way as on Argent, except the user doesn\u2019t get to chose where the key shares are stored:Like Argent, it uses the familiar pattern of username and password to save the private key to Google or a key share to Binance.But the tradeoffs are huge:Connecting with google gives the provider (in this case Binance) access to the personal identifying information associated to that google account.This is a non-starter for me and probably many crypto users.BSC\u2019s implementation of SSS is unique to the BSC Wallet, so a wallet created in this fashion is not going to be compatible with any other.Lastly, the third key share must be saved with BSC, so one more major dependency on Binance.Sequence\u2019s approach to onboarding is to completely obscure the existence of the private key from the user.At the outset, you have a number of web2 oAuth options for login, which first made me think they were saving the private key to the cloud.It wasn\u2019t until I read the Terms that I realized they were using SSS:\u201CThere are three private keys associated with your Wallet, and two private keys are required to access your Wallet at any given time. One private key is stored locally on your device. Another private key is generated using the Login Credentials you provided to open your Account (\u201CAccount\u201D). The third private key is maintained by Horizon. When you log in to your Account\/Wallet with your Login Credentials, you access the account using the private key stored on your device and the private key generated in connection with your Login Credentials.\u201DThis is strait-up shady.For the tiny fraction of users who read the terms, they still won\u2019t know where their second key share is being stored. It says it is generated using login credentials, but doesn\u2019t say where it is stored. So there is no way to know who that third party is.Unsuspecting users might think that if they lose their device, they can simply sign in using their Facebook or Google credentials, not knowing that one of the key shares was on the lost device.Burying these details in the terms and offering zero education during onboarding might seem like a UX win, but the price is that the user essentially knows nothing about their recovery options.Of course when crypto folks talk about AA, almost no one is referring to v1 or v2. They are talking about the mostly theoretical future promise of v3.To understand v3, we need to go one level down the hierarchy of the EOA and there you find the contract account (CA), or the smart contract layer.Think of the CA as an application that lives on the Ethereum network. The CA is programmable and can do all kinds of interesting things, but the one thing it can\u2019t do is initiate transactions.At least not yet.The future vision of account abstraction, described by Vitalik in a blog post is to merge the EOA and the CA, allowing for transactions to be initiated by the contract account.\u201CInstead of [smart contract code] just being used to implement the logic of applications, it would also be used to implement the verification logic (nonces, signatures\u2026) of individual users\u2019 wallets.\u201D \u2014 Vitalik ButerinThis capability theoretically unlocks a whole new world of features, including but by not limited to:Layer 2s are currently leading the charge on this, with zkSync recently deploying a set of tools that facilitate a limited set of AA functionality.Ethereum mainnet doesn\u2019t seem to be too far behind, with an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that integrates AA (EIP-4337) getting a lot of attention from developers and the greater Ethereum community.That being said, the current capabilities of zkSync come with a lot of complexity and overhead, as well as the inherent risks of using any Ethereum Layer 2 chain, which were recently logged by CoinDesk.Layer 2s remain cumbersome from the UX perspective, as most crypto assets are not on a layer 2 by default.Whether you\u2019ve purchased crypto from an exchange or from one of the popular fiat onramps, like Moonpay or Wyre those assets originate on Ethereum mainnet and must first be bridged in order to enjoy any of the benefits of layer 2.Neither EIP-4337 or the much lauded EIP-4844 do anything to address this issue.The first two versions of account abstraction were valiant attempts to address the seedphrase pain point, but when it comes to long term storage of assets these custody models are too fragile for me.Yes, a better solution for the masses will probably emerge at some point, but v1 and v2 basically amount to quasi centralized custody with no backup at all.The reliance on one or more third parties invalidates a key value prop of crypto: No intermediaries.As a practical matter, you have no way of knowing whether a given third party will still be around in a decade or two to help you or your heirs recover your private key.The convenience of having a username and password simply isn\u2019t worth these tradeoffs, imo.As for v3, the progress that has been made is indeed impressive. This next evolution of AA technology is definitely worth keeping a close eye on.However, I think it would be premature to put too much stock in it and I personally will remain skeptical of any project that cites AA as a major differentiator or strategic advantage in the near term.\u2014\nThanks for reading until the end.

It is commonly used in distributed systems, such as distributed databases and file systems, to ensure data consistency and availability.Some real-life applications of the Raft Algorithm include etcd, CockroachDB, and TiDB.First, let's set up a new TypeScript project using Yarn. In your terminal, run the following commands:This will create a new package.json file, install the TypeScript compiler as a development dependency, and create a tsconfig.json file for your project.Before we start implementing the Raft Algorithm, let's define some types and enums to represent the different components of the algorithm.These types and enums will represent the different components of the Raft Algorithm, such as terms, logs, and nodes.First, let's implement the requestVote function that candidates use to request votes from followers. Here\u2019s what that looks like:This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an RequestVoteRPC object as input and returns an RequestVoteResponse object. It checks the RPC term, the voter's current term, and the voter's log to determine whether to grant a vote to the candidate.Next, let the appendEntries leaders use the function to replicate log entries and manage the commit index.This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an AppendEntriesRPC object as input and returns an AppendEntriesResponse object. It checks the RPC term, the previous log index, and term, and the node's log to determine whether to append the new entries to the log.Finally, let\u2019s implement the startElection function, which followers use to start a new election when they have not received any communication from a leader.This function takes a NodeConfiguration object as input and increments the current term, sets the node's state to a candidate, and sends RequestVoteRPCs to other nodes in the cluster.Now that we have implemented the main functions of the Raft Algorithm, let\u2019s add some more functions to complete the implementation.First, let\u2019s add the handleRequestVoteRPC function, which is called when a node receives a RequestVoteRPC.Next, let\u2019s add the handleAppendEntriesRPC function, which is called when a node receives an AppendEntriesRPC.This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an AppendEntriesRPC object as input and returns an AppendEntriesResponse object. It first checks the RPC term and the node\u2019s state and then either returns a response with success set to false or calls the appendEntries function to determine the result.Finally, let\u2019s add the advanceCommitIndex function, which is called when a leader node receives a successful AppendEntriesResponse from a majority of followers.This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an array of AppendEntriesResponse objects as input and updates the node's commit index. It sorts the responses by term and index and then finds the highest index included in most responses.To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript, add the following script to the scripts field in the package.json file:To compile the code, run the following command:You can also use the --watch Flag to automatically recompile the code when any changes are made:To use the functions we implemented in the previous sections, import them into your code and pass in the necessary arguments. For example:To test the functions we implemented in this project, we will use the jest testing framework.First, install jest as a dev dependency:Next, create a tests directory in the root of the project and create a nodeConfiguration.test.ts file inside it.In the nodeConfiguration.test.ts file, import the NodeConfiguration class and write a test to ensure that a new NodeConfiguration object is created with the correct default values:To run the tests, add the following script to the scripts field in the package.json file:Then, run the tests by executing the following command:This will run all the tests in the tests directory and display the results.Next, write tests for the requestVote and handleRequestVoteRPC functions. To do this, create a new file called requestVote.test.ts in the tests directory and add the following tests:There are many more unit tests to add following the same pattern.In conclusion, the Raft algorithm is a powerful tool for achieving consensus in a distributed system. By following the Raft protocol, nodes in the system can agree on a consistent set of commands, even in the face of failures and network partitions.This article has provided a hands-on implementation of the Raft algorithm in TypeScript. While this implementation is just one example of how the Raft algorithm can be implemented, it serves as a useful reference for understanding the concepts behind the algorithm and how they can be applied in practice.We have also included detailed technical explanations and real-life application references throughout the article to understand better the Raft algorithm and its importance in distributed systems.Overall, the Raft algorithm is a key component of any distributed system, and we hope this article has provided a useful resource for understanding its implementation and application.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*wRxluWvpKtI5PYPL","author":"Radovan Stevanovic","title":"Hands-On Implementation of the Raft Algorithm With TypeScript","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/better-programming\/hands-on-implementation-of-the-raft-algorithm-with-typescript-27e9da32094f","tags":[]},{"summary":"EigenLayer recently made headlines with its plans for the EIGEN token\u200A\u2014\u200Athe most talked-about airdrop of 2024. However, this highly\u2026","date":"May 1, 2024","post_content":"EigenLayer recently made headlines with its plans for the EIGEN token \u2014 the most talked-about airdrop of 2024. However, this highly anticipated event was not without its share of controversy. The airdrop, which was supposed to be a straightforward distribution of tokens, was marred with issues such as confusing schedules, non-transferability, and a multi-phase approach. In this analysis, we delve into the complexities of EIGEN, from its airdrop to its utility, and explore the potential implications for the cryptocurrency market.EigenLayer, a restaking protocol, empowers users to re-stake their staked ETH, thereby providing cryptoeconomic security for a diverse range of protocols. This innovative concept transforms ETH into a versatile asset capable of securing entities beyond the Ethereum mainnet, such as oracles, zero-knowledge provers, and Layer 2s. Since its mainnet launch last year, EigenLayer has emerged as the second-largest DeFi protocol, trailing only liquid staking provider Lido, with a staggering total value locked of over $15 billion, or 5 million ETH. This remarkable achievement is largely attributed to their incentivization system, which has rewarded users with points expected to eventually convert into an EigenLayer token.On April 29th, the Eigen Foundation announced the EIGEN token in arguably the most anticipated Ethereum event of the year. Despite the initial excitement about its release and its potential to be valued at over $50 billion and instantly become a top token, the community swiftly turned critical of the tokenomics and the airdrop\u2019s structure. The airdrop will be divided into three seasons of points farming, each with 5% of the total overall supply. The first season will be split into two phases, with phase 1 (90% of tokens) primarily allocated to native restakers and phase 2 (10% of tokens) to complex DeFi users. The second phase will not be released for another month, and the EIGEN token will not be transferable until further notice. These factors and stringent geo-blocking measures that barred access to the claims page for numerous countries and VPNs sparked outrage on Crypto Twitter.Some of this frustration was quelled through further updates, which stated that DeFi users are getting a fair share of the distribution and were not capped at 10% of the supply. Additionally, since this represents the majority of retail depositors, the early whales in Phase 1 will not be able to sell tokens because of their non-transferability. Two issues that have not been resolved are that 55% of tokens go to VCs whose vesting period starts while the token is non-transferable and that it could legitimately be six months to a year until the token is exchangeable. Their stated reason for enacting this limitation is to ensure proper decentralization of the protocol, which we will explore shortly.The EIGEN whitepaper is 43 pages long and provides a detailed explanation of the value and utility of the token. EIGEN will be a work token, meaning that it is rewarded to operators of the network of actively validated services (AVSs) and protocols using EigenLayer\u2019s restaked ETH to secure their protocols. Many other tokens can be classified as work tokens, like ETH or DePIN tokens like Helium\u2019s HNT rewarded to hotspot runners. However, these tokens have two main limitations: first, they are special-purpose and can only be used on a specific application. Second, they can incentivize honest behavior through objective, on-chain attributes like whether or not an ETH validator voted for two separate blocks in the same slot. EIGEN tackles the first problem by allowing for restaking and handles the second through its dual-token approach to truth-seeking. ETH is used as collateral for the system\u2019s objective security concerns and cryptoeconomic security. The EIGEN token will act as collateral for intersubjective security \u2014 that which could not be decided by a distinct rule or piece of code but could reasonably be agreed upon by two humans.To keep the token from going chaotic in the case of potential disagreements about a vote, it has a built-in forking process that keeps the token simple for holders while still providing ultimate flexibility. bEIGEN is the staked version of EIGEN, which can be forked during intersubjective forks. EIGEN is simply a wrapper for this token and will follow the fork of social consensus. The intersubjective process allows someone to put down collateral and state that someone else is acting maliciously. Then, EIGEN holders vote, and if proven correct, that user gets rewarded, the malicious actor gets slashed, and the token forks to a new version that goes to everyone except the malicious entity. Even when the majority is dishonest, the minority token will still exist for people to build on and eventually decide to use as the canonical instance. Given the important role of EIGEN in this process, it can be understood why a tradable token on launch would be messy for the early days of the protocol. Still, this does not excuse the lack of transparency around the unlock process or how VCs get to vest during this period.EIGEN\u2019s token model is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before and unlocks infinite new opportunities for onchain protocols and applications that could previously not be governed. Though the concept is complex, it is abstracted away for EIGEN holders and requires no active maintenance of the token \u2014 the perfect mix of utility and simplicity. Even though the airdrop was initially controversial, and the non-transferability of the token hardly makes this a real airdrop until it\u2019s exchangeable, EIGEN seems to be the next great evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem.By Lincoln MurrFollow Bitpush News on Twitter!","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*bycWMX0OB94ICtby.png","author":"Bitpush News","title":"EIGEN Airdrop: The Evolution of Ethereum","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@bitpushnews\/eigen-airdrop-the-evolution-of-ethereum-e39bb646ac18","tags":[]},{"summary":"Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019ve officially incorporated MelkBot into Neo\u2019s Discord community.

I\u2019m literally sitting here and listening to it, while trying to figure out how to sum\u2026","date":"Dec 27, 2022","post_content":"In 1981, Odyssey released \u201CGoing back to my roots\u201D. I\u2019m literally sitting here and listening to it, while trying to figure out how to sum up a year that has shaken the crypto industry. Every time the industry is shaken, it gives us the opportunity to reiterate why we chose to come here in the first place, what we believe in, and the purpose of what we are trying to accomplish as an industry. Personally, I believe crypto and blockchain is the exchange of value, just like the internet became the exchange of information, and I believe their journey share many similarities. Bitcoin was created out of the 2008 financial crisis as a response to the broken Fiat experiment, which has been running for 51 years now. Bitcoin was created with the belief that the financial system should be better. However, 2022 showed us the ugly truth of when centralized entities are mismanaged and why Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the Bitcoin Network, was smarter than we thought (and we thought he was pretty damn smart in the first place). The industry suffers as a result of becoming the very thing it was created as a response to. It\u2019s time to slam on the brakes, evaluate, and go back to the roots.The year of withdrawal halts \u2014 3AC, Celcius, Voyager and FTX2022 will be remembered as the year of \u201Cwithdrawal halts\u201D. It all started in May with the crash of Terra LUNA, an algorithmic stablecoin, that turned out to be poorly designed and ultimately led to a $60 billion wipe-out of the industry. The contagion quickly spread as a wild fire, ultimately bringing down financial corporations like 3AC, Celsius and Voyager as the biggest entities to suffer from the crash. As a result, the market naturally started to decline in value, removing around $1 trillion of its market-cap in a month. Despite the turmoil, it seemed like we were fine for a couple of months. The market stabilized and sentiments were strong. Remember, these scenarios happen in tech, in finance and even in any industry over time. It\u2019s a part of the maturing process. After all, a revolution of this size takes decades to emphasize. Just look at the impact of the internet that is celebrating its 50th year anniversary next year with the introduction of the TCP\/IP. However, on Nov 9, all hell broke loose because the \u201Csafe, regulated way to buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital assets\u201D declared themselves insolvent, and not just by a bit, but to a degree that makes Enron look like a puppy. Funds at FTX were not safe! At first, it seemed confusing that a spot exchange could be \u201Cinsolvent\u201D? How can a spot exchange that takes in user deposits and lets those users trade and have fun buying shitcoins, and when done, let those users withdraw what\u2019s left - how can that lead to insolvency? It\u2019s not like FTX took users\u2019 funds and operated like some sort of a fractional reserve bank in which they could use funds to leverage the shit off the roof.Except, that\u2019s exactly what they did. Or should I say he. SBF. Sam Bankmann-Fried. FTX took billions of dollars in customer deposits and gave it to its sister company, Alameda Research (the trading company of SBF\u2019s former empire). Alameda then went broke on speculative bets with money they didn\u2019t own, couldn\u2019t pay back the money, and it all fell apart after Binance announced it was selling its pot of FTT tokens due to discrepancies between CZ (CEO, Binance) and SBF. The tweet sparked a massive sell-off in FTT tokens, which, oh by the way, constituted a large portion of the entire FTX balance sheet. Yup, you read it correctly; FTX was largely backed by its own token which it had leveraged to a degree never seen before. If it sounds familiar, this is exactly what happened to Celcius earlier this year, loaning\/leveraging user deposits for speculative bets without disclosing it to their customers. It\u2019s bad and it\u2019s fraudulent and it resonates the main problem that currently shakes the industry to unprecedented scales. However, let me be very clear! 3AC, Celcius, Voyager and FTX all share the same common issue, which is they were all large centralized entities, ruled by bad actors, in which greed and negligence led to their downfall. None of this can be attributed to either Bitcoin nor the blockchain technology itself as a revolutionary innovation. This was systemic risk, build around the technology that failed or, as the new CEO of FTX, John Ray, puts it, \u201CThis is really old-fashioned embezzlement. This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose, not sophisticated at all\u201D \u2014 Wall Street Journal 13\/12\u201322\u201D.Last time I checked, miners on the Bitcoin network were still adding blocks to the chain, and validators on Ethereum were still actively running transactions as nothing happened. Now, as the end of 2022 is approaching, it\u2019s time to leave false narratives as a thing of the past. The collapse of these heavily centralized entities is not an indictment on crypto. Actually, it\u2019s quite the opposite; \u201CIt\u2019s a concrete demonstration of the need for more, better decentralized, trust-free technology\u201D \u2014 Gavin Wood, 25\/11\u201322, Twitter.Centralization failure led to the downfall of all these companies. Blockchain, with its ability to enable decentralization, is the solution, not the problem.Regulation is coming!Never ever have I been this professionally angry with a person as I am with SBF. FTX and SBF had become some sort of white knight for the industry, being the responsible and compliant guy in the room. SBF had ties to the congress of the U.S., given the opportunity to speak with congress and various regulatory bodies such as the SEC and CFTC on future crypto regulation. In other words, he was the man that could move the needle in DC. Now, SBF faces up to115 years in prison if convicted of all charges against him. I\u2019m angry because his greed and negligence has set back the industry, adding fuel to the fire and ultimately made it harder for other honest entrepreneurs and well-managed companies in the space.Obviously, regulators are pissed! They were fooled by a guy in a t-shirt and flip-flops and they are now showing up to the party with a sledge hammer and a message burned into the head of the hammer pointing to the industry. It feels like we did this to ourselves. We gave the regulators a chance to come hard at us. But let\u2019s be clear about something. These examples wouldn\u2019t necessarily have been solved with regulation. These things happen in traditional finance as well, which is heavy regulated. Just look back at the financial crisis in 2008. The only difference here is that in crypto, capitalism rules without any backstop funded by taxpayers to rescue what\u2019s dying. The sad thing in the cases of Terra Luna, FTX etc. is that a lot of people lost their savings, and for them, I feel sorry and hope they get back on their feet.In my view, regulators are far from innocent in what we see in the crypto industry and especially the FTX case. It feels like we, as an industry, are the bad actors, but what about the U.S. government? In the case of the federal reserve, it has doubled its balance sheet during the Covid-19 crisis via quantitative easing, from $4 to $8 trillion. This is what both FTX and Terra Luna tried to do. To print their own private currencies, to prop up their asset-books and valuations, however, they were not sovereign. They could not force anyone to use their currencies under the threat of violence. The state on the other hand can, and the bill always ends up in the hands of the people, either through taxes or inflation. I\u2019m not saying that SBF shouldn\u2019t end up in jail, because I think it is pretty clear from the evidence that he committed fraud. I\u2019m just saying that maybe they learned from the best, and one should be careful about pointing fingers. After all, debt is a game of confidence and at some point that confidence is gone, also in the state.My hope for regulators is that they come together and try to make this right once and for all, and not to ban and over-regulate the space because some criminals took advantage of this new technology. It is about time we get some clarity and just to be clear, I believe regulation is absolutely necessary for the industry if we ever hope to accomplish more than just being some speculative assets you can invest in.As favorable the U.S. government was for the internet in its beginning, as adverse have they been when it comes to regulation for the blockchain space. See this table below on how the Internet vs. Blockchain industry compare in terms of %market-cap and their origin.It is very clear that entrepreneurs in the blockchain space haven\u2019t seen the U.S. as a favorable place to conduct their business like they did in the Internet era and as such, 95% of the market-cap is located outside of the U.S. Crypto regulation in the U.S. has been and still is hard to navigate and so far, regulators haven\u2019t been able to provide any workable framework for how these services can be offered. The SEC, CFTC and other regulatory bodies can\u2019t even agree on what should be determined securities or commodities besides that it is commonly thought that Bitcoin is not a security. Hence, entrepreneurs and builders in the space are afraid to conduct business for fear of litigation. They don\u2019t want to break the rules, but right now they have no clue about what the rules are.What does the future look like for this industry?I have been active in the industry since early 2017 which by now makes me somewhat experienced, even though I wasn\u2019t early to come in. I have seen several bull and bear cycles, and the good thing about these cycles is that there are always learning experiences to be made and to use for the future. So far I have only discussed all the bad things we experienced in 2022, but what about all the positive things we saw? Was it really that bad of a year? Absolutely not! In fact, despite all the negative things that always tend to draw all the medias attention, I\u2019m more bullish and positive in regards to this industry than ever before. Personally, I believe that the biggest event in 2022 was the successful merge on Ethereum with the beacon-chain, removing the Proof of Work consensus mechanism and shifting towards a Proof of Stake consensus instead. This was done on September 15th and went through without any bumps and transactions still running simultaneously. Just to put this in to scope, it\u2019s like changing the engine of an airplane, WHILE IT IS IN THE AIR! Amazing! Ethereum is soon to be a deflationary, yield generating (through staking) and primary base layer for Web3 assets. For anyone interested, I\u2019d suggest you read more about the Ethereum roadmap.I also have to mention Bitcoin as a positive light to a dark year. As I wrote in my intro, Satoshi Nakamoto was smarter than we thought. Despite what the term cryptocurrencies has come to mean and be affiliated with, such as ponzi schemes and joke coins, Bitcoin is not a token issued by any company nor a scheme to create fake value underwriting bad debt. It differs from the rest and should be treated as such. Bitcoin is a scarce, peer-to-peer, censorship resistant digital currency, designed to keep your money safe through any political or economical storm.. Of course, Bitcoin is still volatile in the short term, but historically and in the long term, it\u2019s the best performing asset ever in human history. The question then becomes, are you patient enough to see this play out? Despite the turmoil the industry has been through, it\u2019s still trading around $17.000, which is quite impressive.Remember what I said about learning experiences from various cycles? I think 2022 gave us many very important learnings, however, two aspects really comes to my mind; DeFi and self-custody.It\u2019s actually quite hard to separate the two things, because DeFi can only exist through self-custody and it\u2019s a key metric of using DeFi services. However, the reason why I want to highlight self-custody, is because self-custody does not have to be affiliated with DeFi. It can really just stand alone and be an important reminder of \u201Cnot your keys, not your coins\u201D. In the case of FTX, Celcius and other bankrupt entities, $billions of user funds were lost as a result of customers not being in control of their assets, but instead relied on those entities to safeguard their assets. Instead, user funds could have been self-custodialized and $millions if not $billions could have been safe. Onwards, I think we will see this narrative change and users will become more familiar and safe with self-custody solutions, as the UI experience in wallet providers and DeFi services improves over time. Also, let\u2019s not forget that crypto\u2019s initial promise was to provide people with the choice of being their own bank. I acknowledge that this is not something that will apply to everyone, and for those of us who were privileged enough to be born in a system, where we were granted access to a bank account before we could walk, we will be the last to adopt the narrative of self-custody. However, let\u2019s not forget that approximately 1.4 billion people still remain unbanked, and for those, crypto and hereby self-custody solutions impose life changing opportunities.What about DeFi then? For those of you who are new to this industry, DeFi is short for Decentralized Finance. DeFi really became a thing back in the summer of 2020 and has grown larger ever since, and despite all the hype and projects that have emerged in DeFi, such as the BAYC NFT\u2019s or several \u201CFOMO\u201D yield generating products with unrealistic %APY\u2019s, the idea behind DeFi and blockchain are the answer to many classic centralization risks we saw this year. Why is that? Because DeFi removes the risk of subjective, interest-conflicted and biased human decisions and replaces it with solid, transparent and immutable code. In DeFi, people do not have to trust their counter-party like users did with FTX, when they thought their money was safe. Instead, the rules of engaging with each other are coded into the smart contract. In that way, both parties have transparency and due to the immutable nature, no party can twist or change the \u201Ctruth\u201D of the engagement. The code just executes what both parties signed up to.2022 gave us some real world examples of how DeFi can be used to de-risk the old centralized systems. Both Celcius and BlockFI, which was another lender that went bankrupt, was conducting business with counterparties that invested some of their funds in DeFi protocols. What happened next is the true promise of DeFi; both Celcius and BlockFI were forced by smart-contracts to fulfill their DeFi loans, otherwise their collateral would have been liquidated. This made Celcius prioritize to pay back their DeFi loans up to $400 million due to the nature of the over-collateralization of 150% for taking the loan on several DeFi protocols such as Maker and Compound. If they wouldn\u2019t have paid back their loans, the collateral would have been used to pay back the lenders in the DeFi protocol, making sure no one would have lost their money, except Celcius who didn\u2019t live up to its obligations agreed upon in the smart-contract. In DeFi, a deal is a deal and there is no going back. In the case of the centralized FTX, unfortunately customers are very unlikely to recover their money after being victims of bad human decision-making.Now, as I mentioned earlier, more sufficient regulation could, maybe to some degree, have avoided some of the bankruptcies this year. Centralized exchanges (CEX) will continue to play a significant role in the space, and I do believe we need both alliances, CEX and DEX, in the industry. After all, we still need FIAT on\/off ramps to onboard more customers and custodians for those who are not comfortable with holding their own assets, yet. I think Coinbase, Kraken and Bitcoin Suisse to mention a few, are all very good options and can work great. However, DeFi imposes huge opportunities for the industry to hold itself to higher standards by becoming more self-regulated. In the case of FTX, if the exchange would have been made up by smart contract protocols like we see in DeFi, all activity on the exchange would have been fully transparent, verifiable and auditable by its users and hereby also regulators (hint, hint).I sincerely believe that DeFi is the future of finance even though it still has some growing pains it needs to mature from as with any new technology. It is clear that DeFi impose huge opportunities to solve the risk and limitations we\u2019ve seen throughout this year and with centralized finance of old. It provides transparency, verifiability, auditability and self-custody as a response against poor human decisions, because; \u201CWhen finance is based on the subjective behaviors of men, it will be prone to the failures of men\u201D \u2014 Erik Voorhees, Money and State, 2022.Final thoughtsHistorically, the market bottoms every time Bitcoin and blockchain is dead and the world goes under. I think we are very much in the middle of that narrative at the moment. The truth is, the world is not going under, and Bitcoin or the technology itself isn\u2019t going anywhere. The flood of bankruptcies we saw in 2022, especially with the implosion of FTX, is certainly a setback for the industry on the short-term. However, on the positive note, we get rid of bad actors and hopefully this will accelerate the timeline of crypto-related regulation that we have been waiting for, which makes it essential for builders and entrepreneurs in the space to scale their businesses. Furthermore, DeFi has come out as the big winner from all these series of events, as it shows the unmatched opportunities that lie within the use of it. To be honest, DeFi is the ultimate solution to the problem of trust in financial markets. My prediction is that we will see more innovation and groundbreaking services within DeFi than in any other industry on the planet over the next 5 to 10 years. I know for a fact, that my eyes will be laser-focused on the development of this industry. Oh, and then I haven\u2019t even mentioned zero-knowledge proofs. Well, that\u2019s for another article on its own!Now, it\u2019s hard to come with any predictions as to where this industry is headed in the short term. We still live in an environment with too many uncertainties such as a 40 year high inflation as a result of FED hiking interest rates, increasing energy prices mainly due to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war and just a general hangover from irresponsible Covid-19 policy decisions. These are all indications as to why the crypto winter could last longer this time. However, I still believe that we are in a very different place this time from previous crypto winter cycles. First of all, institutional adoption remains high. We see many take a long-term perspective and realize the opportunity of this industry as such, while also accepting the natural cycles that follows. Looking forward, I believe the evolution of the industry of digital assets will be focused a lot around tokenization, DeFi and Web3 applications. Bitcoin will remain strong, as its core principles haven\u2019t changed, while Ethereum has strengthened their position as the leader of L1\u2019s in a competitive area with many competing for the same users and capital. With its succesful merge and strong community, I believe in a reinforcing Ethereum narrative in 2023 and onwards.As a final note, I\u2019d like to reiterate my initial statement regarding the evolution of the internet era and how it shares many similarities with crypto. Remember what happened in the dot-com era in the 1990's? It was a stock market bubble as a result of massive growth in the use and adoption of internet. The bust resulted in a flood of bankruptcies and transformations across the entire industry. However, I think it is safe to say that the technology \u201Cinternet\u201D survived. Rest is history!Thank you 2022, may we never see you again.Happy new year. 2023 is warmly welcomed.Sincerely,Nikolaj Rosenthal","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*b7DnotcqP9UXeJOsWFZjCA.jpeg","author":"Nikolaj Rosenthal","title":"Going back to the roots.

Rockefeller became the world\u2019s first billionaire, and in the hundred years since we haven\u2019t had a trillionaire. And today, not only do we have a trillionaire, we also have the world\u2019s first quadrillionaire. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology and finance, the world\u2019s richest man alive today also happens to be the richest man in history, and by a substantial margin.Now, there\u2019s debate on who the richest man in history was\u2013how do you mark to market Mansa Musa\u2019s massive empire? How can you estimate the value of all of Egypt under the rule of Augustus? Whether the Roman emperor\u2019s wealth made him a trillionaire in modern USD terms, and whether Mansa Musa was richer than him thanks to his trade in commodities (salt, gold, slaves), it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Because now the richest man in history is, quite literally, exponentially richer than them both.And he\u2019s not dead yet, which is also pretty good for the pocketbook.To show just how much richer the richest person alive is right now, let\u2019s go through some quick numbers. If we accept the old Times article\u2019s estimate that Augustus\u2019s net worth was $4.6 trillion, that is still a good $995.4 trillion less than the world\u2019s richest man. In other words, the wealthiest person alive could buy and sell Augustus and his Egyptian holdings over two hundred times\u2013and still have tens of trillions left over to take a short vacation somewhere.Source: AuthorThanks to the wonders of modern technology, we have entered a new world of once incomprehensible wealth. Financial innovation thanks to cutting edge technologies, from the foundations of the internet and cloud computing to the specialized proprietary technologies of artificial intelligence, DeFi, Web3, and blockchain, has created the kind of illustrious wealth and power that previous epochs would find incomprehensible.We live in a new era of new possibilities. So now, I would like to introduce you to the richest man on the planet and how he earned a net worth of $1,000,000,000,000,000 before anyone else could.It\u2019s me.How I Did ItHello, my name is Michael Foster and I am the world\u2019s first quadrillionaire. I have to admit, I have never been motivated by money, so becoming the richest person of all time is pretty heady. It\u2019s also a little scary\u2013I\u2019ve installed some security cameras at home. I might get a dog.Doing so was neither simple nor easy, and I did not get here alone. I have to thank my business partners, many of whom you will be familiar with. I would like to thank my partnership with Alphabet (GOOG), the Mountain View-based tech firm that has provided the extremely foundational technology that has made this wealth creation possible. Of course, one must also thank Satoshi Nakamoto for being the first domino in this wonderful trip. But there are so many illustrious people to have come before me! Do Kwon, Mark Karpeles\u2026the list really does go on and on.To the innovators! To the crazy ones!But my biggest gratitude goes out to Sam Bankman-Fried, whose innovations in cryptocurrency have changed the rules forever. And while SBF is not the most beloved person on Earth right now, thanks to all of that fraud and stuff, I didn\u2019t lose any money so I can\u2019t blame him too much.And while SBF did a little oopsie and has seen his personal net worth go down from $19 billion to, well, something, his trailblazing is truly a sight to behold in wonder and adoration. Having innovated in the crypto space, SBF is now working towards new innovations in the legal space. While I can\u2019t get into details here too much, so far we\u2019ve seen 100,000 claims against his FTX that could easily turn into over a million, thanks to the very large userbase of FTX. If he is convicted for each claim separately, and if he gets 2 years in prison per conviction, he could be facing a prison sentence of over 2 million years.And for that, I applaud SBF; after inspiring me to innovate in the crypto world to have the largest personal net worth in history, SBF is himself innovating in the world of self-incrimination to have the longest prison sentence in history. This altruism, it must be said, is very effective.I must admit, I have learned from SBF\u2019s mistakes. By taking money from the outside, by allowing people to trade in his cryptocurrency, and by making massive promises of future profits to customers, SBF got himself in some legal hot water. I\u2019ve decided to avoid all of these pitfalls by not selling my token to outsiders. This produces infinite scarcity that is a solid defense against price declines for my token while also giving me complete and total control of its value relative to fiat currencies, other cryptocurrencies, and other stores of value.The token is called Super Buckaroo Fun Coins (SBF Coin) and they are all in my own personal wallet. If you don\u2019t believe me, just take a look at our balance sheet.Source: Author (note how I took a full screenshot so you know there\u2019s nothing hiding anywhere!)Note first how I have learned from SBF\u2019s mistakes. Upon releasing his balance sheet, SBF did not get a good response. Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted that it\u2019s \u201Can Excel file full of the howling of ghosts and the shrieking of tortured souls\u201D. Well, note how my balance sheet is a Google Sheet, not Excel, so clearly different.Note the lack of liabilities, too. Since I hold 100% SBFCoin and have no clients or counterparties, I have no need to ask for a bailout\u2013a problem that is keeping SBF awake (as well as stimulants?) as he reaches out to investors for a potential bailout (sorry, SBF, I have enough to bail out FTX\u2019s missing $8 billion approximately 125,000 times over with SBFCoin, but I\u2019ve got some friends over so I\u2019m a bit too busy to help out).Boring Financial Stuff (go ahead and skip this bit)At its current valuation, the current quadrillion SBFCoins in circulation are worth $1 each, making the total market cap of SBFCoins $1 quadrillion. This also means that SBFCoins are the largest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market cap.Current trading volumes for SBFCoins are massive. I like trading with myself (no kinkshaming, okay?), so I tend to trade about $900b in net worth of my SBFCoins per day, on average. That daily average volume has been increasing lately because bigger numbers are fun, and it\u2019s worth noting that trades execute in a millisecond, much faster than other cryptocurrencies and stocks traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges.Boring Technical Stuff (go ahead and skip this too)SBFCoin is a robust decentralized DeFi platform using cutting-edge Web3 technologies to unlock value and provide extremely fast transactions thanks to an internal proprietary accounting mechanism built on the back of proprietary Google AI-driven SaaS innovations in cloud computing-based database tools (i.e., I\u2019ve got a Google Sheet). It is a cryptocurrency utilizing the following AI-driven DAO-backed gas-free zero-slippage mining-free protocol that is both gasless and offers PoS-backed smart contract executions:t̴̖͙̮͐̿̈̏̃̿͋͆̊͋͘͘͝ḧ̷̟̻̜̜̬́̿̈́̎̌̂̂͌i̷̡̬͎͕͛ş̸̨̯̮͕̣͖̫̜̮̘̟͙͊̀̀̓͗̌͂ ̶̻̫̲̊̊̉ḭ̷̧̧̡͓̪͎̥̦̀̉̾̀̓̔̈́͗̓̉̑̔̌̋̍s̴̛̛̗̹̣͎̻̦̝̙̖͇͑͛̅̅̎̑̾̔̓̆͝͝͝ͅͅ ̴̜̻̹̯̠̜͕̇̀̿́͋̄̿̒̈́̏͘̚͘̕͝ả̸̢̙̹̼̤͖͎̝̭̻͗̄̾͌́͛́͆̎̇̚͝ ̵̬̯̣̲̜̙̙̳̹͕͎̀̓̚͝s̷̢̢̼̤̥̘̻̻͖͙̝̽̊̊͒̆͒̈́̾͘͜å̸̢̫̹̪̘̈́͘ẗ̸͍͇̯̤͉̙̭̘̥͆̔̌̓͊̅ḯ̶͇͎̻͕͚̜̩ŗ̶̞̗̠͇̬͔͛̈́̈̔̉̈́͐ĭ̵̢̦̜̥̞̻̤̟̼͇̪͔̮̈͒̈́̓͌͗̃͜c̵̠̾̆̓̿͂̈́̆̑̏̇͂͆̉ã̵̝̮͙̖̝̫̱̖̫̼͖͓̋̚͠ͅl̶͓̼̞̜̙̣̲̗̜̝̲̟̪̫͂́ ̵͓̬̮̫̘̭̫̒̃̈͐͗́̈̌̓͜ǰ̷̡̬̗̝̰́͒̊̎̈́̒̓̓͛̚͜ͅo̷̧̲̼͓͈͎͍̤̣̹̣̹̔̌͐̃͑́̉̕̕͝ḵ̷̘̅̆̈́̂̃̽͝ȇ̴̪̺̒ ̸̛͖͍̦̈͆̂̇̂͐͋̂͝͠t̸̨͓̹̲͉̘̰̗̘͓̞̑̋͐̉̌̿̈́̌́̎́͛͠ͅo̸̧̢̡̳̞̪̼̗͉̗̥̝̥͋̀̀̒̅̚͜ ̵͍͖͈̘̞̦̅͋̉͐̄̉̕͜ͅp̵̡̜̞̤̱̞͎͗́̇́̍́̃̐̾̌̽ͅǫ̸̭̠͎̈̀͆̃̐̈̆͑̈̕͘͝i̶̢̡͍̬̯͓̼̮̹͈̦͍͍̪̍̀̿̎́n̷̢̛̥̱͋̏̏͊͆̈́͋̾t̵̪̦̲̤̺͚̩̹̤̺̦̟̜̩̼̏̄̓̐̀͝ ̴̡̨̯̱̦͈͛̋͑͛͌̓͋̀̈͋́̈́͘̚͝ͅǫ̵̳̘̱͎̮̗̖͖̘͎͎̣̺́̊̋̓̐̄̒͌̎͛̿̆̚̚ủ̵̧̯̦̭͉̈́̔̾͛͗̐͂͘̕͜ţ̷̰̖̜̘̞̞̦̜̠̤̭̤̋̇̈́͝ ̴̛̳̻̫̩͓͈͕̪͉͒͜h̶̟̙͒̋̅̒ō̷̖͕̤̖͇͚̞̚w̴̨̮̥͙̐ͅ ̶̢̤̰̬͈̐̍̊̄̀̂̂̍̐̂͠͠i̷͚̗͖͕̦̫͖͕̫̝̠̣͒̂̈́̌̂́͗́̚̚̕͝n̵̰̹̪͍͇̖͔̞͎̦̯̺̚ç̶̻̫͊̔͛͋̈ŗ̸̡̡̻̹̗̥͙̼̟͉̣̺̠̜̄͑̑̈́̑́̀̎̔̚̚e̷̦͚̱̒̾͂̉̿̈̉̓͒͆͘͝ͅd̸̯̃̄̀̄́͘̚̕͘̕͝ͅi̸̧͔̞̪͖̾̉̿͒̒̉̏̏͐̾́̎́̚͝b̶̬̜͆̿̄̾̑̈́͘l̴̤̋͒̈́̑̀͛͊́̓̋̚̕͘͝y̴̬̖̼̟͊͊̊̋́̚͝͝ ̶̢̼̥͙͔̤̙̳̲̖͚̓́̊̈́͑̃́̊͊́̒s̸̞̜̖̀̌̓̀͂̄̅̏̀̕t̸̪̣͔̹̤̠̒͋͂ŭ̵̠͎̑̀p̴̨͓͖̖͉̫̺̭͉͔͔̟̫̽̈́͌̌̈́͂̈́̇͆͜i̵͔̍̄̇̚d̴͎̖̤͙̟͙̱̠̦͇͎͆͌̉͌̍͌̑̉͗̅̉͜͝͝ ̴̛̝̬̠̞̗̦͚̮̌̀̉͋́͑̓̄͊͜ͅa̷̻̬̺̖̬͉͉͌̈̆̐̃̒̾͊͗̌̚͠n̴̜̰̹̖̬̹̅͊͌̍͂̌̚͠͠d̷̘̹͚͔͉̫̼̻̈́̍͌̀̃̋̿̔͐̕͠͠ ̸̡̛͔͇̹̫̱͍̜̩̞͖̋̄̓̄̈́̅̽͠͝ŏ̷̼̰͗͆̾̾̔̑̚b̴̞̥̝̯̱͔̮̳͈̪̪͓̖̈́v̵̢̢̛͇̞̭͍̾̋̈́̓̅̃̌̕í̸̛̛̛̦͍̮͕̭̗̺̇͛̇͋͑̊̉̾̈͝͠ơ̷̥̜̂͌̋͒̎̅̈̍͛͆̄̇̅̕u̶͇͂̾͋̑s̷̗͍̰͈̥͖͖̻̦̟͕̙̳̳̆̄͗̅̐l̸̥̩̺͎̰̒͒͂͌͐͝͝y̴͈̮͎̼̙̌͑́͘ ̶̤̼̻̥̩̪̗̭̹̮̤̺̀̇f̶͔̦̻͊̄̅̉͛r̴̛̩̩̟̺̝̻̪͚͉̼̟̭̂̀̌̏̈̌̏̉͘͠͝ͅa̸̧̢̛͕̳̗̮͎̻̩̝̯̝̤̗u̸̡͍̟̩̳͍̪̱̲͔̪͊̈́̈́͛̔̔̈͗̊̋̊̽̕͜͝ͅd̵̡̢̦̮̫͚̖̹̼̞̅͗́̋͊̒̈̀͆̏̍́̍͜͠û̵̘̣̈́͊̈̈́͗̆̀͜͝l̴̲̫̖͍̣̳͂ͅȩ̴̨̞͙̝̯̮̜̤̖͈̤̞̜̗͂́̂̇̈̔̐̀͝n̷̢̨̮̼̩̼̘͚͉̖͉͈̎͐̐̃͂͜ͅt̸͔͍͕̞̮̲͕́̎͘ͅ ̴̡̛͕̱͔̹̦̇͌̏̿̅̂̂͊̿̕͜ê̴͉̮̓͒͆̒̈̽̾͛̎͗̑͛v̶̗̖̯̫͌͆̅̈́̽̏͆̏͆̿̐͠ḛ̷̮̪͗̇̍̾̉̒͝r̵͓̳̦̪͔͈̂̐̍̉̔̔͛̾̿͆̆̉ȳ̶̨̖̬̫̜̤̘͇̂̽̋̍̈̔́̓͘͘͘ͅt̶̢̧̞͙̺̥̠̥̜͕́̄̆̏͐̄͜h̷̢͓̮̘͇̥̣̖̪̼̩̀̂̈̅̆̈́̅͘̕ỉ̶̢̩̻̦̪͍͎͚̼̬̂͐̆̓̅̈́͑̐͐̄̋ͅn̴͕͎̘̹̗̳̑̈̓͛́͠g̸̟̬͓̻̭̲̣̿̽͌̂ ̶̥͙̠͈̯͖̗̬̜͓̘̯̲͆̉̓͒͊̒̍̈̄͛̕͘͝ì̴̡̧̮͖̲͇͙͕̖̱̦̣̦̐̇n̵̢̧̺͈̲̬̜̠͎͔̈́͑̂̊̓̆̈́̋͜͝ͅ ̶̬̳̥̬̬̼̰̘̱̏͗͌͠t̴̛̩̼̜̏̃̊̀͛ḩ̴̺̦͉̌̐̈́̊̆͂͂̀͠e̴̙̤̟̗̝̺͙̍̀̈̈́̀̐͂̎͂̅͒̒̚ ̵̨̙̖̼̣̦̠̙̱͋́͌̍̿̾̐͋̚c̶̼̫̖̹̜̟͙̲̙̪̮̫̾̋͛̽̊͛̅̓̐́͂͘̕͜͠ͅr̷̤̤͌̆̃͂̔y̷̡̲̬̜͌ͅͅp̵̧̼͚̯͍͓͖̘̗̭̯̪̜̿̊͝ͅt̶̨̡̨̩̟̩̲̺̲̱̻̼̽͛̇̈́̃̊̄̌̈̏̿̄͘̚ơ̶̳̹̄͂͊̇̿́̈́̐͂͆̋́̕c̶͚̳̣͉͍̯̪̜̩̙̞̑̍̀u̶̱̝̦͓͖̗̠̞̺͛̒͘̕ŕ̷̡͇͖̱̰̻͈̜͔͒̀͐̄͑̄̐͘͝͝r̶͚̻͆͐̂̈͒͜͠ͅę̶̛̤̯̯̠̖̔̽͠ṋ̴̞̝̤͉͖̥̬͖͔̬̭̱͓̌̈̐̏̍͗̅̆̿͊̈́̂͝c̸̟̠̘̳͚͕̞̍̾̅̉͗̓̾̽͘ͅy̵̨̧̩͕̫̭͕̳̩̦͂̏̀̈́̐̈̿̐̽̀͠ͅ ̷̛̗̲͔̟͖̻̔̍̎̓̈́̕͘w̴͔̝̬̟̺̬̉̅͊ờ̶̝̲̅̆̇̈̌̇̕̚r̴̨̨̡̹̭̤̝͍̞͎̞̾͗̈́̄̀́̐͑͘l̶͇̪̜̱̘̻̀̂̎d̴̢̡̲̖̻̹̳̳̭̙̺̏ ̴̙̗̞͂̽͌͐̃͑̀͒͌̋͌̓͛͛̿h̷̨͍͙͎̭͒̀͗̄́̏̿͂̃́͌͠͝ͅa̶̼̳̭̰̝̘̭̎͗̊͐̊̕͠ș̷̛̹̥͖̤̺̜̥̫̳̜̤͖̂́͊͆͒͋͆̍͗̈́̕͜ ̴̘̳͊̀͌̀̇̓̾͌͒͋̚͝͝b̶̙̰͕̜̼͙̞͓̖̮͕̠͕̬͍̑̏̇̈́̅́̃͊̏̈́̇̎͝e̶̡͖̹̮̟͔̣̝̠͍̺͕͊̾̽̾͗̅̀̉̀̃͆̕̕c̴̢̢͔̠̩̝̺̰̥̦̘͎̿͂̌̉̿́̌͆̿͂̍̕̕͜͜͜͝o̷̢̢͚͕̮̙͕̻͇͖͚͇̪͊͆̆̀̿̅͑̃̉͂́̈́m̸̧͓̼̠̫̆́̀͋̃͗͜͝ͅę̵͉͚͇͎̪̟̪̒,̷̘͙̭̦̤̺̲̝͇̬͙͊ ̵̱͎̪̺͚̪̠͔̖̌̀͜͜ą̸̗̖̓͊̈͐̈̈̽͆̃̌̊̚̕s̷̨̧̛̺̑͒̄̋̍͛̈́͝ ̶̡̹̞̳̼̮͎̻̪̼̲̉̓̆̍̿̊̈́͋́̓̌͘̚Ḯ̷͙̝̣̯͕̿̊͂̕ ̵̡̞̘͍̞͉͔͓̹̯̙̪͊̑͋̽̐͌͠͝ẁ̷͔̳̬̲̖̂̊̃͂ͅr̷̞͉͈͕̃ͅợ̶̯̪̽̊̅̏̓̀̽̽̕͝ẗ̶̡͍̫́̀̈́̉̑̌͌e̴̮̜̠̦̊̎͛̑͘̕ ̵̙̱͔̫̪̤̫̙̉̓̐į̶̖̱͓͍̮͔̟͇͍͉̣̥̒͌̀͗n̵͈͈͕̥̯̖̮͔͇͐̎̒̆͊̏̍̾͊͛͜ͅ ̸͔͇̐̿̂́̂̔͒̊̈̽̄́̕͘͘2̴̨̝̬̘̲̫̤̯̣̜̇̄̊̆̍͒͆̈̒̏̐̄͜0̵̨̢̳̳̞̞̝̱̈́1̴̞̭̺͖̩͕͇̰̖̍́̀̑̓8̴̗̗̦̲͚͚̻͕̝͆́͛̎̀̈̉͗,̷̭̜͇͙͕͑̿͆̍̇͝ ̶̡̛̼̪̋͌̃̂̊̐̿̾̓̌̈́͛͛a̷̙̱͖̳̰̗̭̟̱͇̥̙̗̓̏̔͆̂̊̕͘͜͜͝n̸̢̬͈̈̈̊̃̔͐͌̉d̶͉̫̬̮̞͙̞͈̩̬̟͈̺́͋̊͗̄͒͆͒͗̃̈́̂̚͜͝ͅ ̴̡̭̭̱̞͇̲͎͇̣̦̞͐̎͒̃̽̌̆̀̈́̀͊̚͜͜ǐ̷͇̳̞̰͕̰͊͐͆̈́̎̈̃͊̓̚f̵̧͖͍̙̼͕̬̘͂̌̓̋̚̚͝ ̷̲͔͇͂̎͝y̶̡̢̧̝̯̭͇̞̻̦̙̥̜̰̬̽̈́̓̈̑̐̇̏͘͝͠ö̸͉̞͇͍͙́̐̋ų̵̧̭͕̰̱̭̺̰́̓ ̵̧̛̣̳̞͍̭̣̼̤̙̖͈̲̗̓̀̀̓̈́̈̈́̋͗̀̆̆͜a̵̧̟͎͗̊̎̑͠r̷̞͖̰̦͚͇̻̰͚͔̫̬̗̓̇̍̎̍͂͛͐͊͐͊̏̀͗ḙ̴̠̲̖̣̐̓͂̿̈́͛ͅ ̵̢͍̺̦̺̻̒͠s̸̯͉̞͋͂̇̀̈́̃͋͛̐̿t̵̥̟͓͇͉̱̔̇i̶̻̦̍̂̏̍͛̓̌́̚̕̚͠ḻ̵̡̧̛̤̠̜̦̮̲̳̙̻̦̏̍͊̈́͐̒͂̍̌͝l̴̡̨̢̡̧̬͕͈͙̘̣̞͓̇̂̅̂͊̐͛̓̉̀̅͝ ̷̛̺̤̠͈̰̤̖̥̘͍̀̈́̐͐̽̏̚͝i̴̧̩̞̣͎̝͒̓͝n̶̢̛̑̉͂̈ ̵̨̲̪͕̻̰̞͚̹̓̽c̷̡̹̜̝̯̭̝̄̀͌̾̅͋́̕r̸̭̈́͋̒͗̎͋͆̈́͝͠y̴̡̛̹͈̼̍̍͋͊̆̽͗͒͒̈̆̉͝p̸̰̞͎̏t̴̢͚̘̟̰̹̬̠͇̪͒̐͐̔o̷̡̧͔̥͖̝͖̬͔̤͙̤̒̈́̓͐͘ ̷̯̤̇͌͐̇̈́̀̈̂̿͆͝t̴͚̰̼̜̞̘͈̹̼̓͂͐̓̈́͆̑̂ǫ̷̛͍̭̖̮͖̞͆ͅḑ̷͎̜͓͎̣͍̦̘̳͓̯̤͎͆͒́͜à̵̻́̊̾̿͗̓̈́ỹ̴͓̣̠̈́́͛̋͋̌̉̕͠ ̷̣̥͕̳̙̓̾͊̾̈́̈́͆̊͠Ḭ̵͍̰̳̦͕́ ̸̧͕̹̯̳̤͚͉͖͕͊̃h̴̤̳̄̀̉̇̆̉̓̄̕o̴̲̳̬̽̉͗̂̈́͛̊͋̕͘͝͠n̶͓͛̍̃̿͋͝͝ẻ̵͌̎̿̅́̈́̾͐͘ͅs̶̞̩̝̞͔͍̬̓̎̏̐͠ͅţ̸̰̼͖̥̤͗̾̎̍̅̃̃̅́͂̍͝͠͝͝l̷͚̖͓̇̏̍͋̑͐̆̓̕͝͠y̴͍̖̑͛͐̈́͗̀̋ ̷̢̢̧̢̣̹̱͈͔͓̬͍͉̈́t̵̩̪̥̦̦̯̦̫͙͖̗̀̑̄̈́̈́ͅh̵̛̥͚̩̙͉͚͊̃͑͆̉̇̐̉̿̅̚ͅi̴̡̛͇̞̖͕̤͖͔̟̖͋̂͂̂̍̈͗͠ņ̵̡̨̡̨̠͎̦̲̱̺̠̥̤̀̀̚k̵̛̛̖̗͇̫̮̪̜̱͙̏̈́̉̀͒̂́̈́̕͘͝͝ ̴̡͎̤͈͇̹̗̲͈͈̑̂̾́͑͗̽̅͐͜ͅͅỹ̴̙̹̋̊͘ͅȏ̶̥̫͒̇͛͌̆̓̽́̿͒͝͠u̶̖̻͐͌̃̏͋̐̽͑͂́́͗̕͠ ̵̨̭̞̣̬̳̉̈́̊̀̐͘͘͠͠͝å̴̢̪̦̰̤̟͉̽̄̐̋́̽̄͛̋̒̾ŗ̵̨̦͓̬̘̮̑́͆̔̽̊̔̒̊͂́͋̕͝͝ȩ̶̭̖͕̱́̈͌̽͂̇̑͋́̂̆͜ ̴̨̙̘̲͕͙̥̹͙̹̺̳̏̆̊̎͌b̸͙̲̯͇̳͍̙̐̈́̐̑͂̿͊̂͠e̴̡̡̬̺̲̩͈̺̰͍̳̒̉ỹ̶̡̧̢̻̥̲͖̭͈͚̭̺̅o̴̥̔̈́̄̈́̒͊̚ͅn̷̳̘̪̼̯͍̝͔̑̿͗͋̋̄̏̐́̄̓̚͠͠d̸̝̝͉̙͎̭͙͉͋͌́̅͝ͅ ̵̲̯̳̫̦̟͔̫̬̥͛͐̓̋̋̍̏̈́́̈̆h̴̢̢̻̼̠̜̗̞́͗̃͌͂̈́̉͛͗͆͒̿̀ͅè̷̱̄̉̀͝ḽ̴̬̘͓͕̇̈́͝͝ṕ̸̫͕̟̀̽̓͌͆͗͆̊̿̀͂̕̕̚.̴̢̯̳͇̞̬̫̖̙͒͒͒́͜͠Few understand.How You Can ProfitI am not selling SBFCoins for fiat, both to avoid the risks of millions of years in jail time and also to preserve the value of SBFCoins.

I asked myself several questions and below are the answers I got so far.1: Will AGI Be A Reality? If Yes, When?It depends on how we define AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). To me AGI means human-like reasoning, learning, problem solving and continuous improvements. It\u2019s a matter of when not if, though I won\u2019t spend too much time speculating about the timing.As a matter of fact, in the past 18 months or so, one branch of AI \u2014 Large Language Models (LLMs) \u2014 have made major technology and adoption breakthroughs. ChatGPT reached 100M users in just 2 months, the prior fastest one was Tiktok in 9 months. On the flip side, hallucination remains a major technical gap, besides all these ethical, societal, regulatory and geo-political concerns.I fine-tuned and run a few open source models myself locally on my Apple M2 silicon, even the most performing one \u2014 LlaMa3 (8B) \u2014 often responded to me with \u201Clogical but wrong\u201D hallucinating answers.Obviously there is more work to do before AGI, it might take years or even decades. Nevertheless AI gets more powerful everyday, it can do more types of work and do them more intelligently, see a diagram from The Internet of Agents by Davide Crapis.2: What Are The Roadblocks To AGI?We often hear from people like Sam Altman and Elon Musk that AI scaling law will soon or eventually be constrained by compute, energy and\/or training data before AGI. For sure we need a longer term vision and roadmap to revolutionize the GPU and energy industry (e.g. fusion energy), and (using AI to) generate unlimited, diversified, high quality synthetic training data.However, these seemingly new problems can potentially be solved or at least mitigated by existing solutions. In the short to mid term, to me this is an efficiency game in every step of the AI process. We should and must do performance profiling and optimization on training, fine-tuning and inference, e.g. more efficient data and model parallelization, cutting every waste in GPU memory and bandwidth consumptions, quantization, batch and offline inference processing etc. The good news is, Meta\u2019s recent well received LlaMa3 LLM is a perfect example of efficiency meets performance.Another seemingly new problem around the globe GPU \/ energy shortage, my understanding is it\u2019s more of a distribution problem than an overall supply problem. We should and can find an existing solution to take advantage of all those idle GPUs across data centers and energy across regions, without a longer term GPU rearchitect and revamping of the globe energy network. Crypto could help here (see later discussion).In addition, there are broader ethical, social, regulatory, geopolitical and interdisciplinary implications and challenges, which I will leave to future discussions.3: Large Or Small Language Model?Large Language Models are getting larger and larger. GPT4 has 1.75 trillion parameters, fed with 15 trillion tokens and was trained by 25,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The soon to come GPT5 will certainly out number these, people were speculating massive $2.5B training cost for GPT5.However, models don\u2019t always have to go bigger. Instead of a monolithic approach, we could adopt a modular approach just like any other modern computer systems. We could use a handful of medium\/large size models, e.g. LlaMa3 70B, as base models, and build much smaller domain specific incremental models on top of them. During inference, these incremental models can share and connect through the same base model. In this way, one application can access multiple incremental models and base models at the same time. Hence not all these companies have to build their own super, costly and largely overlapped generalized model, instead we can keep expanding the overall model capability with an open community, building and sharing base models and incremental domain specific models on top of each other. (see the below diagram)Moreover, companies like Apple and Microsoft are experimenting in a different direction. Instead of LLMs, they are building SLMs (Small Language Models), e.g. Apple OpenELM (270M, 450M, 1.1B, 3B) and Microsoft Phi-3 Mini (3.8B), both trying to balance model size and performance. They may not be as powerful and general as LLMs like ChatGPT 4, Claude 3 Opus, let alone the incoming GPT 5\/6, but they could be very suitable for cases like edge AI on smaller IoT devices without reliable internet connection, or privacy sensitive scenarios like Amazon Alexa or Google Home or certain highly regulated industry where data needs to be kept on premises. SLMs inference can be 100% hosted on edge like a mobile device, without touching any remote servers or internet at all.4: Does AI Need Crypto? And Vice Versa.While AI does not inherently \u201Cneed\u201D crypto to function, and vice versa, the integration of these technologies could lead to significant advances in both fields. Each can enhance the capabilities and address the limitations of the other, potentially leading to more robust, efficient, and trustworthy systems.What can Crypto do for AI?What can AI do for Crypto?5: What Are The Challenges To Bring AI On-chain?Let\u2019s start with a quick comparison between AI and Crypto for their default settings:As you can see, AI and Crypto defaults are different or even quite opposite in most dimensions. Bringing AI on-chain presents a set of unique challenges that stem from the fundamental differences in how these technologies are designed and operated. Here are some of the key challenges and possible solutions:Conclusion: (Generated by chatGPT)As we stand at the crossroads of two revolutionary technologies, AI and crypto, the potential for transformative change is immense. The integration of AI\u2019s deep learning capabilities with blockchain\u2019s secure and decentralized framework promises to redefine how we handle data, execute transactions, and build trust in digital interactions. However, as outlined, challenges such as scalability, verifiability, data privacy and regulatory compliance remain formidable but not insurmountable.While the technical hurdles are significant, the opportunities \u2014 for efficiency, security, and new business models \u2014 are profound. Innovations like intent-based smart contracts and enhanced security for crypto platforms highlight just the beginning of what\u2019s possible when these technologies converge. However, as we push forward, a balanced approach that considers ethical, social, and economic implications is crucial.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*gX19A58nVxJN2f7O","author":"Shenghu Yang","title":"AI meets Crypto, a view from crypto and infra background","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@shenghuyang\/ai-meets-crypto-a-view-from-crypto-and-infra-background-162f3e8fad90","tags":["Blockchain","Large Language Models","Artificial Intelligence","Cryptocurrency"]},{"summary":"The crypto industry is obsessed with figuring out if digital assets are actually backed by anything, but they should be careful what they\u2026","date":"Dec 21, 2022","post_content":"","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*Z7uPuyqULl5bRACti-ifbw.jpeg","author":"Patrick Tan","title":"Binance\u2019s Billions are Backed, but You\u2019re Probably Asking the Wrong Question","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/chainargos\/binances-billions-are-backed-but-you-re-probably-asking-the-wrong-question-df7c19e652ae","tags":[]},{"summary":"Cryptocurrency mining has evolved, and with the right apps, you can streamline the process significantly.

In Q3, the sector that received the largest amount of VC dollars according to the ETI report was Web3 with nearly $900 million. That\u2019s more than fintech, biotech, security, ecommerce, gaming, and dozens of other mainstream industries.And Q3 wasn\u2019t the first time that Web3 topped the ETI report. In fact, Web3 has led the ETI rankings for 5 consecutive quarters now. Over the past 12 months, there has been over $6.5 billion of ETI capital invested into Web3, which is more than double that of the next highest category of fintech at $2.7 billion.Even with all the ongoing challenges across cryptocurrency, which has seen its combined market capitalization decline by 2\/3 since last November, investment interest in the sector remains stronger than other industries. Why? Because entrepreneurs still want to start Web3 companies.Building a good Web3 startup is hard. Explaining what makes a startup Web3 in the first place is even harder. Here are a few attempts. Leading Web3 investor A16Z describes Web3 as \u201Cthe internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens\u201D. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3, describes it as \u201Can alternative vision of the web, where the services that we use are purely algorithmic things hosted by everybody\u201D.

Pretty confusing right?Here\u2019s a simpler definition: a Web3 startup interacts with data stored on a blockchain. That\u2019s it. Read from Ethereum via an RPC provider? You\u2019re a Web3 company. Send a transaction on the Solana network? Web3. Implement a Connect Wallet button on your website? Same. Blockchains, the public shared ledgers of information, are the data building blocks of Web3, and if you use any of this data in your product, then you\u2019re part of Web3 too.Now why is this interesting to entrepreneurs? Because we haven\u2019t had free access to data in a long time.All consumer products need data. If you\u2019re building a restaurant discovery website, you need reviews. If you\u2019re building a shopping app, you need a product catalog. If you\u2019re building a photo or music or video sharing service, you need (obviously) photos or music or videos. Sure you can get users to create that data for you \u2014 after all, users authoring data is the core tenet of Web2. But it takes a lot of users to create a useful amount of data, and until then the product experience for those few initial users will be incomplete or simply bad, which is then an impediment to acquiring more users. So you\u2019re stuck in not a vicious cycle, but a stagnant cycle.For entrepreneurs from a decade plus ago, data used to be readily available online. You could crawl it (ex. Airbnb crawling apartment listings from Craigslist), or subscribe to it via RSS feeds that publishers were widely distributing. Platforms like Facebook and Google were also generous with their data providing robust API access (remember all the social games that used Facebook\u2019s Graph API?). There was once even an entire category of products called mashups predicated around this idea of shared data that was composable.Unfortunately for entrepreneurs today, data is no longer easily accessible. RSS has been largely abandoned, most sites prohibit crawling and will sue to prevent it, and platform APIs from Facebook and others have either been shut down entirely or severely limited. More than ever, the web is a collection of walled data gardens controlled by a handful of gatekeepers and for good reason: the data and the infrastructure running that data is incredibly valuable. Gartner last year reported that 80% of the global cloud infrastructure market is controlled by just 5 companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, and Huawei. It\u2019s no coincidence that these are 5 of the most valuable technology companies in the world.The \u201Chaves\u201D (companies with data) generally no longer want to share with the \u201Chave nots\u201D (startups), which is why Web3 has become so attractive to entrepreneurs: you get to build with data in Web3. With blockchains, data is freely available to everyone. There are no gatekeepers to blockchain data because ownership is decentralized across tens of thousands of individuals or entities running their own shared copies of the data. You can spin up your own Ethereum node in a matter of minutes and download the entire blockchain onto about 1TB of storage. That would fit on many laptops so there\u2019s not a lot of expensive infrastructure you need either.Because of blockchain ledgers, data access in Web3 is equal. Every startup has access to the same tokens, wallet addresses, transaction history, etc. and can build as complete a customer experience as any other company. We\u2019re all \u201Chaves\u201D in Web3, but is what we have useful? In other words, Web3 startups can now build new products that are filled from day one with all of this public blockchain data. But does this public blockchain data help make products that customers actually want to use?There has been one dominant customer value proposition for all Web3 startups this year. One powerful use case that all of their Web3 products \u2014 from games to art to fitness tracking \u2014 have been helping customers with: making money. During the last crypto bull market, every Web3 product became a speculative asset, and making money became the only scenario Web3 companies had to think about. When your product promises to generate positive returns for customers, it doesn\u2019t have to promise much else.Take for example NFTs, which rocketed in popularity this year with millions of people owning them. In the bull market, NFT startups focused all their energy on helping those million users make money because the primary use case for NFTs was financial speculation. In their pursuit of driving up the price, most NFT product innovation centered around building reward systems for holding onto NFTs (i.e. staking) as well as creating walled gardens around NFT ownership (i.e. token gated content). But those features came at the expense of investments into arguably more interesting product explorations like being able to do things with NFTs and have them interact with other projects.Remember, NFTs are stored on blockchains where the data is freely accessible by anyone. Therefore, Web3 entrepreneurs should be building all sorts of novel, interoperable experiences with NFTs, just like Web2 entrepreneurs did with mashups. But because everyone was so obsessed with just the floor price, NFT projects built entire products designed to keep people from doing anything with their NFTs or having them interact with any other project. The pursuit of financial speculation above all else took data that was inherently open and made it closed.But now we\u2019re in a downmarket where returns are negative. Web3 products can no longer rely on just the use case of making people money, and have to provide other value to earn the time and patronage of customers. We\u2019re going to see a lot of entrepreneurial time and energy shift from innovating on financial speculation to pursuing new ideas for what you can do with data stored on shared ledgers besides making money. Will customers find these new scenarios valuable? Will products filled with public blockchain data be useful?Who knows for sure. But because entrepreneurs still want to build Web3 startups and investors want to fund these companies, we\u2019re about to find out.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*Bx8uLnqHSGpbqZUm","author":"Eric Feng","title":"Why are there so many Web3 startups?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@efeng\/why-are-there-so-many-web3-startups-43a150379d52","tags":[]},{"summary":"I\u2019ve been in crypto for years now, I saw it all\u200A\u2014\u200Athe highs, the lows, and the memes.

That milestone would unfortunately begin a three year downturn across the entire Internet sector. The NASDAQ would go on to fall 50% by the end of 2000, and continue dropping before bottoming out at 1,114 on October 9, 2002.During the dotcom bubble as the NASDAQ was soaring, usage of the technology powering the dotcom bubble \u2014 the Internet \u2014 was also soaring. The number of Internet users doubled from 150 million at the beginning of 1999 to 300 million in March 2001 as the NASDAQ peaked. But when the NASDAQ crashed, Internet usage did not follow suit. During the period when the NASDAQ plummeted to its low point in October 2002, the number of Internet users doubled again to 600 million.So for the runup of the dotcom bubble, pricing of Internet technology (as measured by the NASDAQ) and usage of Internet technology (as measured by the number of Internet users) was directly correlated. As the NASDAQ went up, so did the number of Internet users. But when the dotcom bubble popped, pricing and usage became uncorrelated. As the NASDAQ fell, the number of Internet users actually grew. This growth would go on to fuel and even greater peak for the NASDAQ many years later.The lesson here? Pricing is only one measure of success.On November 8, 2021, the global cryptocurrency markets reached an all time high of a combined $2.9T in market capitalization. Like the dotcom bubble, cryptocurrency also grew an astounding 6x during this crypto bubble, but accomplished that feat not in 5 years but in only 1 year. It was the equivalent of the entire inflating of the dotcom bubble happening in just 12 months.Over the next 8 months, the crypto bubble would pop sending the cryptocurrency market cap plummeting by two-thirds to below $1T, and triggering disastrous events like the crash of the Terra stablecoin, the bankruptcy of Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, and the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celcius along the way. Across the board, the prices for all the major Layer 1 blockchains fell significantly from their highs from November 2021: Bitcoin from $68.7k to $20k, Ethereum from $4.9k to $1.5k, Solana from $260 to $30, and so on.But as the crypto bubble popped, what has happened with usage of the blockchains, which is the technology that powered the crypto bubble in the first place? As the price of blockchain technology (as measured by cryptocurrency market cap) has fallen, has usage of blockchain technology fallen too? Let\u2019s find out.First, let\u2019s look at usage of the Bitcoin blockchain, which represents almost 40% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. During the runup of the crypto bubble from 2019 to 2021, Bitcoin payments per day (which is one measure of Bitcoin usage) was directly correlated with the price of Bitcoin \u2014 as price went up and down, so too did the number of payments. But starting this year as Bitcoin price has fallen by half, the number of Bitcoin payments has held steady. In 2022, Bitcoin price and Bitcoin usage have become uncorrelated.A similar trend is also happening with Ethereum, the second largest blockchain representing almost 20% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. Before 2022, Ethereum price and Ethereum usage (this time measured by active addresses, which is similar to active users of Ethereum) were directly correlated. But despite the crash in Ethereum\u2019s price in 2022, the number of active addresses has not fallen this year. Again, usage becoming uncorrelated with price.There are more signs of price and usage becoming uncorrelated in other crypto markets. Crypto development company Alchemy published a recent blog post observing that developer usage of blockchains (as measured by downloads of popular development libraries Ether.js and Web3.js) is up 178% this year, the fastest rate of growth ever. And that\u2019s despite the crypto pricing downturn.According to DappRadar, leading Solana NFT marketplace Magic Eden has seen rapid growth in transaction volume this year, growing from an average of 230k daily transactions in January to over 880k daily transactions now. As the price of Solana has dropped over 80% this year, Solana usage (as measured by NFT trading activity on Magic Eden) is up 280%, another sign of blockchain pricing and usage becoming uncorrelated.This is not to say that all is well with the cryptocurrency market. There has been a lot of real pain caused by the downturn, and there is still a lot of uncertainty ahead. But so was the case in the year 2000 with the Internet when pricing crashed. Yet from that crash, usage of the Internet, uncorrelated from pricing of the Internet, would grow and from that growth spark a rebound. It would take 15 years before the NASDAQ recovered to its dotcom bubble highpoint. But when the NASDAQ did eventually reach those highs again, it would then go on to triple them over the next 6 years.Like with the Internet, it may take years if not a decade for crypto pricing to recover. But in the meantime, there are signs that cryptocurrency usage, uncorrelated from cryptocurrency pricing, is continuing on or even growing. Usage that may lead to exciting new products, services, and scenarios for cryptocurrency. Usage that provides a reason for some much needed rational optimism for cryptocurrency.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*VkQ-PZtSOkNC2-SH","author":"Eric Feng","title":"Rational optimism for crypto","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@efeng\/rational-optimism-for-crypto-968104c08e7f","tags":[]},{"summary":"How to earn passive income with nodes and how NodeX helps you to do it really passively.","date":"Feb 1, 2024","post_content":"How to earn passive income with nodes and how NodeX helps you to do it really passively.Node operators in the blockchain industry can earn money through various mechanisms, primarily focusing on generating passive income. This income is derived from the essential roles these nodes play in maintaining and securing blockchain networks. Here\u2019s a detailed look at how node operators can earn passive income:Block Rewards and Transaction FeesNode operators can earn money through block rewards and transaction fees. Block rewards are given for successfully validating a new block of transactions and adding it to the blockchain. This process is central to proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms, where miners (in PoW) or validators\/stakers (in PoS) compete or are chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks. Transaction fees are paid by users to have their transactions included in a block and validated by the network. These fees can vary based on network congestion and transaction complexity[1][12].Staking RewardsIn networks that utilize a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, node operators can earn staking rewards. Staking involves holding a certain amount of the network\u2019s cryptocurrency in a wallet to support network operations, including transaction validation and network security. The staked assets essentially act as collateral that helps ensure the honesty of the node\u2019s operations. Rewards are typically proportional to the amount staked and the duration for which it is staked[1][5].Masternode RewardsMasternodes are a special type of node that perform additional network functions beyond transaction validation, such as enabling instant transactions, participating in governance, and more. Operating a masternode usually requires a significant upfront investment in the form of a collateral deposit of the network\u2019s cryptocurrency. This deposit, along with the node\u2019s operational performance, earns masternode operators higher rewards compared to regular nodes or stakers[3][12].Passive Income CharacteristicsRunning a node can provide a steady stream of passive income. This is particularly attractive in the cryptocurrency industry, where other forms of investment may require more active management or entail higher risk. The passive income from nodes comes from the automated processes of validating transactions, creating blocks, and participating in the network\u2019s consensus mechanism. However, it\u2019s important to note that while the income can be passive, node operation may require initial setup work, ongoing maintenance, and monitoring to ensure the node remains online and functional[4][5].Factors Influencing ProfitabilityThe profitability of running a node depends on several factors, including the type of node, the specific blockchain network, the cost of hardware and electricity, and the current rewards structure of the network. For example, networks with higher transaction volumes may offer more opportunities to earn transaction fees, while networks with lucrative staking or masternode rewards can provide significant passive income streams. However, potential operators must also consider the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which can affect the value of rewards[1][10].In summary, node operators in the blockchain industry can earn passive income through block rewards, transaction fees, staking rewards, and masternode rewards. The profitability of these ventures depends on various factors, including the type of node, the network it supports, and the costs associated with running the node.NODEx gives participants access to Nodes. By combining assets NODEx ensures marekt power and invests strategically into Nodes of different projects that are operating through Node operations.Contributor Funding:Participants contribute funds to NodeX to support the project\u2019s operations. These funds are used to acquire and maintain the necessary infrastructure for running nodes.Node Acquisition and Operation:NodeX uses the contributed funds to purchase and operate nodes within a blockchain network. This participation in the network could involve activities such as transaction validation, block creation (in the case of mining nodes), or other network functions, depending on the chosen blockchain protocol.Revenue Generation from Node Operations:The nodes operated by NodeX generate revenue as part of their normal functioning within the blockchain network. This revenue could come from various sources, such as transaction fees, block rewards (in Proof-of-Work networks), or other mechanisms depending on the specific consensus algorithm in use.Buyback and Burn Mechanism:The unique aspect of NodeX is the commitment to using the revenues generated from node operations to buy back $NODEX tokens from the market. The bought-back $NODEX tokens are then burned, meaning they are permanently removed from circulation. The burning process reduces the total supply of $NODEX tokens in existence.Token Appreciation Strategy:The buyback and burn mechanism is designed to create scarcity by reducing the supply of $NODEX tokens. According to economic principles, a decrease in the supply of a token while demand remains constant or increases could potentially lead to an appreciation in the token\u2019s price over the long term.Long-Term Value Proposition:NodeX positions itself as a project with a long-term value proposition, suggesting that the combination of node operations, revenue generation, and token buyback and burn will contribute to the sustained appreciation of the $NODEX token.NodeX is a project that leverages contributed funds to operate nodes within a blockchain network. The unique aspect of the project is its commitment to using the generated revenues to buy back and burn its native $NODEX tokens, aiming to create long-term value and potentially contribute to the appreciation of the token\u2019s price.Citations:\n[1] https:\/\/www.blockchain-council.org\/blockchain\/blockchain-nodes\/\n[2] https:\/\/bitkan.com\/learn\/best-nodes-for-passive-income-can-i-really-get-profits-from-them-14487\n[3] https:\/\/www.altcoinbuzz.io\/masternode\/how-to-earn-crypto-setting-up-your-node\/\n[4] https:\/\/tradewise.community\/crypto-nodes-passive-income-generating-revenue-through-cryptocurrency-participation\/\n[5] https:\/\/moneymade.io\/learn\/article\/crypto-validator-node-passive-income\n[6] https:\/\/tokentax.co\/blog\/passive-income-crypto\n[7] https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/blockchain-node-operators-how-work-shridhar-vatharkar\n[8] https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Flnifkc4tw\n[9] https:\/\/coinpedia.org\/guest-post\/how-to-start-own-business-as-a-crypto-node-operator\/\n[10] https:\/\/tradewise.community\/what-crypto-nodes-are-profitable-identifying-lucrative-opportunities-in-cryptocurrency-node-operation\/\n[11] https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/learn\/what-is-a-bitcoin-node-a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-nodes\n[12] https:\/\/www.okx.com\/learn\/crypto-passive-income","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*sSuXUFokusNPZpx5uUGx0Q.jpeg","author":"NodeX","title":"Earn Passive Income With Nodes.","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@nodexfinance\/earn-passive-income-with-nodes-46c5ed74a026","tags":["Crypto","Cryptocurrency","Investing","Passive Income","Blockchain"]},{"summary":"Hello, dear community!","date":null,"post_content":"Hello, dear community!To enhance our communication, we\u2019ve decided to start weekly updates on the Reality Metaverse ecosystem. This is our inaugural edition, and I would love to hear your feedback. What would you like to see in future updates? In this edition, I\u2019ll cover some recent milestones, delve into our latest development updates, discuss some challenges we\u2019re facing, and share our outlook for the future.I\u2019m thrilled to announce that the Weather Challenge Staking has reached 100% completion! We are now gearing up for the Genesis Event, initially planned for May 13th, but now rescheduled to May 15th.We\u2019ve also set up a brand-new Twitter account specifically for this initiative. Feel free to follow us here for real-time updates.Additionally, our Hold to Earn event has been the talk of the community. While it\u2019s currently active, we may need to adjust the rewards based on its performance. This event has been a valuable learning experience, teaching us important lessons for future planning.As highlighted in yesterday\u2019s article, the Hold to Earn event has been a mix of popularity and controversy. While I won\u2019t rehash the specifics that didn\u2019t go as planned, rest assured, we\u2019ve learned valuable lessons from this experience.On the $RMV token front, we recognize the current market trends aren\u2019t favorable. Our chart isn\u2019t looking as strong as we\u2019d like, and we\u2019re actively working on strategies to improve this for potential future investors. However, it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re committed to thoughtful progress, not rushed solutions. The market determines the value of our project; our role is to enhance our offerings through targeted marketing, new listings, strategic collaborations, and engaging events like the Weather Challenge Genesis Mint.Feedback from our community indicates that Landlord GO is experiencing gameplay challenges. Though this game is managed by Reality Games and not directly by us, we are planning strategic initiatives with our sister company to enhance user acquisition and restore the engaging gameplay that appeals to a broad audience, not just a niche.In terms of overall development, we recognize that progress may seem slow. We are tackling many projects, and despite market noise and some delays, major development sprints are nearing completion. Our focus is steadfast: to build and innovate continuously. We are excited about the upcoming announcement of an AAA game, which we believe will elevate our project to new heights. I am profoundly grateful for our community\u2019s loyalty and patience, understanding that achieving greatness takes time.As we near the completion of our current projects related to the marketplace and the Reality NFT portal, we are excited to share what lies ahead. Next week, I plan to unveil a detailed multi-year roadmap for the Reality Metaverse, but let me give you a sneak peek into one of our daring upcoming initiatives:$RMV Reduction: By reducing the circulating supply of $RMV, we aim to stabilize and potentially increase its value. The tokens removed from circulation will not only help fund further development and marketing but also adjust the balance of rewards across royalties, events, staking, and Genesis collections.Value Recompensation: Although $RMV will be deducted, stakers will receive monthly NFTs whose value exceeds the lost tokens. Additionally, stakers will earn $TRUMPET coins at a higher rate relative to their staked $RMV, along with other perks like potential spots on the Genesis whitelist.Example Staking Scenario: (Note: Actual figures may vary)Your initial investment of 10,000 $RMV could yield:If the staking took 6 months, you would end up with 6 x NFTs airdrops, 7000 of $RMV, and $TRUMPET at a very high APR + $RMV worth of 4500 in $TRUMPET coin.We believe this innovative approach will propel our ecosystem forward, but your feedback is crucial. Let me know your thoughts before this goes live \u2014 we value your input and want to ensure our community is on board with these bold moves.As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the utility of $RMV, we are introducing flexible and time-specific staking options. These options are designed not only to reward our community members but also to strategically manage the supply of $RMV over time. Here\u2019s how it works:Stakers can choose from several fixed periods for locking in their $RMV:Each period offers a unique staking APR, which is set to decrease as more users participate. This tiered approach ensures that early stakers benefit from higher APRs, encouraging prompt participation. Here\u2019s an illustrative example of how APRs will adjust based on $RMV price targets (note: actual APRs will differ, and do not worry, they will not be that high):Until $RMV reaches $0.04:Until $RMV reaches $0.07:Until $RMV reaches $0.10:This structured reduction in APRs is designed to align with our strategic goals of sustaining long-term value and demand for $RMV, by adjusting the rewards as the token appreciates. This approach not only helps in managing the economic model of $RMV but also provides clarity and predictability for our stakers.While a detailed article on Genesis NFTs is scheduled for tomorrow, I\u2019d like to give you a brief preview today. Currently, these NFTs are significantly undervalued, and we are committed to elevating their floor price to much higher levels in the near future.Utilities of Genesis NFTs:Stay tuned for the comprehensive details in tomorrow\u2019s article, and prepare for an exciting journey with Genesis NFTs!A quick snapshot of the upcoming Weather Challenge Genesis NFT:As we look to the future of the Reality Metaverse, our plans are not only ambitious but designed to significantly enhance user engagement and expand our ecosystem. Here are the key initiatives we plan to implement:These mid-term initiatives are designed to propel our growth and ensure that we continue to provide a dynamic and enriching environment for our community.As we look further into the future, our plans for the Reality Metaverse become even more visionary and expansive. Here\u2019s what we plan to implement in the long term:These long-term initiatives are designed not just to expand the Reality Metaverse but to fundamentally transform how users interact with digital and real-world environments, leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a truly immersive experience.I hope you found this detailed article insightful. Your questions and feedback are invaluable to us, so please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Next week, I\u2019ll be prepared to address your inquiries and share insights directly with everyone.

And you want to know how Blockchains work\u2014the fundamental technology behind them.But understanding Blockchains isn\u2019t easy\u2014or at least wasn\u2019t for me. I trudged through dense videos, followed porous tutorials, and dealt with the amplified frustration of too few examples.I like learning by doing. It forces me to deal with the subject matter at a code level, which gets it sticking. If you do the same, at the end of this guide you\u2019ll have a functioning Blockchain with a solid grasp of how they work.Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that they\u2019re chained together using hashes.If you aren\u2019t sure what a hash is, here\u2019s an explanation.Who is this guide aimed at? You should be comfy reading and writing some basic Python, as well as have some understanding of how HTTP requests work, since we\u2019ll be talking to our Blockchain over HTTP.What do I need? Make sure that Python 3.6+ (along with pip) is installed. You\u2019ll also need to install Flask and the wonderful Requests library:Oh, you\u2019ll also need an HTTP Client, like Postman or cURL. But anything will do.Where\u2019s the final code? The source code is available here.Open up your favourite text editor or IDE, personally I ❤️ PyCharm. Create a new file, called blockchain.py. We\u2019ll only use a single file, but if you get lost, you can always refer to the source code.We\u2019ll create a Blockchain class whose constructor creates an initial empty list (to store our blockchain), and another to store transactions. Here\u2019s the blueprint for our class:Our Blockchain class is responsible for managing the chain. It will store transactions and have some helper methods for adding new blocks to the chain. Let\u2019s start fleshing out some methods.Each Block has an index, a timestamp (in Unix time), a list of transactions, a proof (more on that later), and the hash of the previous Block.Here\u2019s an example of what a single Block looks like:At this point, the idea of a chain should be apparent\u2014each new block contains within itself, the hash of the previous Block. This is crucial because it\u2019s what gives blockchains immutability: If an attacker corrupted an earlier Block in the chain then all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.Does this make sense? If it doesn\u2019t, take some time to let it sink in\u2014it\u2019s the core idea behind blockchains.We\u2019ll need a way of adding transactions to a Block. Our new_transaction() method is responsible for this, and it\u2019s pretty straight-forward:After new_transaction() adds a transaction to the list, it returns the index of the block which the transaction will be added to\u2014the next one to be mined. This will be useful later on, to the user submitting the transaction.When our Blockchain is instantiated we\u2019ll need to seed it with a genesis block\u2014a block with no predecessors. We\u2019ll also need to add a \u201Cproof\u201D to our genesis block which is the result of mining (or proof of work). We\u2019ll talk more about mining later.In addition to creating the genesis block in our constructor, we\u2019ll also flesh out the methods for new_block(), new_transaction() and hash():The above should be straight-forward\u2014I\u2019ve added some comments and docstrings to help keep it clear. We\u2019re almost done with representing our blockchain. But at this point, you must be wondering how new blocks are created, forged or mined.A Proof of Work algorithm (PoW) is how new Blocks are created or mined on the blockchain. The goal of PoW is to discover a number which solves a problem. The number must be difficult to find but easy to verify\u2014computationally speaking\u2014by anyone on the network. This is the core idea behind Proof of Work.We\u2019ll look at a very simple example to help this sink in.Let\u2019s decide that the hash of some integer x multiplied by another y must end in 0. So, hash(x * y) = ac23dc...0. And for this simplified example, let\u2019s fix x = 5. Implementing this in Python:The solution here is y = 21. Since, the produced hash ends in 0:In Bitcoin, the Proof of Work algorithm is called Hashcash. And it\u2019s not too different from our basic example above. It\u2019s the algorithm that miners race to solve in order to create a new block. In general, the difficulty is determined by the number of characters searched for in a string. The miners are then rewarded for their solution by receiving a coin\u2014in a transaction.The network is able to easily verify their solution.Let\u2019s implement a similar algorithm for our blockchain. Our rule will be similar to the example above:To adjust the difficulty of the algorithm, we could modify the number of leading zeroes. But 4 is sufficient. You\u2019ll find out that the addition of a single leading zero makes a mammoth difference to the time required to find a solution.Our class is almost complete and we\u2019re ready to begin interacting with it using HTTP requests.We\u2019re going to use the Python Flask Framework. It\u2019s a micro-framework and it makes it easy to map endpoints to Python functions. This allows us talk to our blockchain over the web using HTTP requests.We\u2019ll create three methods:Our \u201Cserver\u201D will form a single node in our blockchain network. Let\u2019s create some boilerplate code:A brief explanation of what we\u2019ve added above:This is what the request for a transaction will look like. It\u2019s what the user sends to the server:Since we already have our class method for adding transactions to a block, the rest is easy. Let\u2019s write the function for adding transactions:Our mining endpoint is where the magic happens, and it\u2019s easy. It has to do three things:Note that the recipient of the mined block is the address of our node. And most of what we\u2019ve done here is just interact with the methods on our Blockchain class. At this point, we\u2019re done, and can start interacting with our blockchain.You can use plain old cURL or Postman to interact with our API over a network.Fire up the server:Let\u2019s try mining a block by making a GET request to http:\/\/localhost:5000\/mine:Let\u2019s create a new transaction by making a POST request tohttp:\/\/localhost:5000\/transactions\/new with a body containing our transaction structure:If you aren\u2019t using Postman, then you can make the equivalent request using cURL:I restarted my server, and mined two blocks, to give 3 in total. Let\u2019s inspect the full chain by requesting http:\/\/localhost:5000\/chain:This is very cool. We\u2019ve got a basic Blockchain that accepts transactions and allows us to mine new Blocks. But the whole point of Blockchains is that they should be decentralized. And if they\u2019re decentralized, how on earth do we ensure that they all reflect the same chain? This is called the problem of Consensus, and we\u2019ll have to implement a Consensus Algorithm if we want more than one node in our network.Before we can implement a Consensus Algorithm, we need a way to let a node know about neighbouring nodes on the network. Each node on our network should keep a registry of other nodes on the network. Thus, we\u2019ll need some more endpoints:We\u2019ll need to modify our Blockchain\u2019s constructor and provide a method for registering nodes:Note that we\u2019ve used a set() to hold the list of nodes. This is a cheap way of ensuring that the addition of new nodes is idempotent\u2014meaning that no matter how many times we add a specific node, it appears exactly once.As mentioned, a conflict is when one node has a different chain to another node. To resolve this, we\u2019ll make the rule that the longest valid chain is authoritative. In other words, the longest chain on the network is the de-facto one. Using this algorithm, we reach Consensus amongst the nodes in our network.The first method valid_chain() is responsible for checking if a chain is valid by looping through each block and verifying both the hash and the proof.resolve_conflicts() is a method which loops through all our neighbouring nodes, downloads their chains and verifies them using the above method. If a valid chain is found, whose length is greater than ours, we replace ours.Let\u2019s register the two endpoints to our API, one for adding neighbouring nodes and the another for resolving conflicts:At this point you can grab a different machine if you like, and spin up different nodes on your network. Or spin up processes using different ports on the same machine. I spun up another node on my machine, on a different port, and registered it with my current node. Thus, I have two nodes: http:\/\/localhost:5000 and http:\/\/localhost:5001.I then mined some new Blocks on node 2, to ensure the chain was longer. Afterward, I called GET \/nodes\/resolve on node 1, where the chain was replaced by the Consensus Algorithm:And that\u2019s a wrap... Go get some friends together to help test out your Blockchain.I hope that this has inspired you to create something new. I\u2019m ecstatic about Cryptocurrencies because I believe that Blockchains will rapidly change the way we think about economies, governments and record-keeping.Update: I\u2019m planning on following up with a Part 2, where we\u2019ll extend our Blockchain to have a Transaction Validation Mechanism as well as discuss some ways in which you can productionize your Blockchain.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*zutLn_-fZZhy7Ari-x-JWQ.jpeg","author":"Daniel van Flymen","title":"Learn Blockchains by Building One","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@vanflymen\/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46","tags":["Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin","Python","Software Engineering"]},{"summary":"The Project","date":null,"post_content":"The TRICK project, supported by the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 program, aims to promote sustainable practices in Europe\u2019s textile, clothing, and food industries through a digital platform.Within the architecture of the TRICK platform, the Quadrans Foundation with the continued support of Truebit Team has developed a unique tool to enable verified textile traceability information to be provided to the end consumer.Quadrans, with its global accessibility, emerged to serve the intricate needs of industries and supply chains. It offers automated processes through traceability and smart contracts, thereby lowering costs and bolstering security and enables seamless collaboration and cross-border transactions.Quadrans is an open-source Blockchain ecosystem derived from Ethereum, retaining elements like the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The platform has evolved to integrate unique features while maintaining interoperability with Ethereum, supporting seamless transitions of existing solutions. Looking ahead, Quadrans plans to implement a hybrid consensus protocol combining Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to enhance security and efficiency.For those reasons Quadrans was chosen by the TRICK consortium as the reference public blockchain and data plane where information regarding production processes to consumers and stakeholders can be saved.The Identity-Manager Smart Contract provides a decentralized mechanism on the blockchain for managing and verifying the associations between user identifiers and their corresponding public addresses. It supports functions like adding or editing identities and retrieving associated public addresses or user IDs. It ensures controlled access by allowing only a designated IdentityManager address to modify identities, enhancing decentralization by eliminating reliance on a centralized database for storing these associations.The Portability Smart-Contract on the public layer stores all public documents for each instance of the portability process. The smart contract is designed to allow write access solely to its owner, enhancing security by ensuring that only the owner can add data, and upon completion, ownership can be relinquished to a null address to seal the data permanently. This design prevents unauthorized data alteration even if the private key is compromised. In brief, the smart contract can handle the following data:Data portability empowers users by allowing them to transfer their data across various services or platforms, thereby avoiding vendor lock-in and enhancing competition among providers. This flexibility is especially important in the blockchain ecosystem, where it supports the interoperability of decentralized applications and aids in operational efficiency and disaster recovery. A number of alternative solutions were examined before implementing portability on blockchain via Truebit:The Quadrans Team has developed a key component called the Verifier Agent that allows the authenticity and integrity of data to be verified before it is published on Portability Smart-Contract.In the TRICK Project, the NFTs represent individual products, enhancing their authenticity, traceability, and security by embedding a uniqueProductID that links back to centralized systems. Additionally, each NFT has a meta-data file stored on IPFS, detailing the product\u2019s attributes and ensuring transparency.The activity of testing and adapting the product to real business needs is ongoing. Pilot projects are currently being conducted by major textile companies such as Fratelli Piacenza S.p.A and the Customs and Monopolies Agency, among others. The expectation is to release the first apparel samples associated with Quadrans NFT by the end of 2024.Stay tuned","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*kJNFmvqx9Q6CzubhiQj5Mw.png","author":"Davide Costa","title":"Quadrans and Truebit revolutionizing Textile industry","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/quadrans\/quadrans-and-truebit-revolutionizing-textile-industry-3aecd7a74a86","tags":["Blockchain","Fashion","Smart Contracts","Quantum","Cryptocurrency"]},{"summary":"In the dynamic world of blockchain technology, innovation is the key to success.

I sat down to write this article and instead found myself generating random Chihuahua images until I got \u201Cthe one.\u201D It involved a lot of trial and errors, and I got to a point where I could start to understand how the AI model worked under the hood, and what prompt works the best for my purpose.Similarly, building MEV bots is also enjoyable, and it also involves grinding and understanding why our bot works or doesn\u2019t. But it\u2019s slightly different from AI, because we can actually lose money while we\u2019re testing our strategies. This is why we should analyze our competitive edge very carefully and test everything out before we start running our system.Today, we are going to continue from where we left off last week:We had built a system that could detect sandwich opportunities from Uniswap V2 forked DEXs. And we would like to see if we can really profit from sending bundles on-chain.For readers that haven\u2019t read through the code yet, here\u2019s the code:Before we get started though, I\u2019ll ruin the fun for you a little bit, and mention that this system isn\u2019t profitable yet. But it can be.Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll take a deeper look at the system and try to add more optimizations to the code so that it\u2019ll become more competitive.Integrating these additional features will significantly increase the likelihood of the system succeeding in real trades.However, it\u2019s important to note that this exercise shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a shortcut to profiting in the MEV market, as there truly isn\u2019t one. By the time you\u2019ve successfully implemented all the features and stayed with me until the end, you\u2019ll realize the considerable effort required to transform your system into a winning one.I hope that these open-sourced guides can assist individuals in comprehending the nature of MEV, aiding them in uncovering genuine opportunities in the market.Before we move on, I\u2019d like to mention one thing.There\u2019s a question I constantly get from a lot of people:And I never really give them a straight-forward answer, because the system can be profitable in the hands of someone who understands the system very well, and at the same time be useless in another\u2019s.There\u2019s a character I used to like very much in One Piece, Robe Lucci.For those of you that aren\u2019t familiar. Robe Lucci trained his body to become a weapon itself. And his skill, Shigan 👉, is capable of lethally striking an armed man with his index finger alone.Likewise, I believe that all our systems can become like Shigan. It will become competitive if you understand the core logic very well. But it\u2019s just a fragile finger if you don\u2019t train yourself for it.We\u2019ll be going through some interesting topics in today\u2019s article.And if you ever get stuck anywhere, please feel free to reach out and ask others if they\u2019re experiencing similar issues from the Discord server 🙏:Let\u2019s get started! 🏎To see if we have a chance at winning real sandwich trades, we\u2019ll start running our code from where we left off in the previous article.The snapshot of the code is on a different branch of the Github repository, you can go to phase1 branch for this:Try running the code by doing:The program will update new pools and tokens that were launched on Uniswap V2 since our last run, and start monitoring for sandwich opportunities.We let it run for a while 😴.And we detect our first sandwich after 5 blocks:We can see that the transaction of the victim is as follows:0xd1a41244a9aab38f41ce5fb54ce5ba3bcd20e07afb439bc968b720f5031feb80It\u2019s a transaction that is making a trade using the Universal Router.The optimized token in amount was 2.0 WETH, and we could expect to earn a profit of 0.0516 WETH from the sandwich bundle.However, this is only if we don\u2019t consider gas costs. We are using:and the base fee is at 22.27 gwei, so our total gas costs end up being within the range of:0.00475 ~ 0.00498 ETHThere can be a slight difference on the gas costs, because of gas refunds and how foundry-evm calculates this, so we\u2019ll go with the value we get from our simulation engine, which is 0.00475 ETH.Then our revenue is expected to be:Let\u2019s see if our sandwich bundle is competitive.Using Gambit Labs\u2019 Auction Stats service, we can figure out how many people were submitting bundles to capture this opportunitiy, and see how much bribe they are sending to builders.Paste in the transaction hash from Auction Stats tab and let\u2019s see how competitive we were:You can see that there are a lot of fellow searchers trying to capture the same opportunity:The top briber on Gambit Labs was using 0.058102 ETH as the bribe. And our revenue after factoring in gas costs is 0.0469 ETH, so we can see that we need to optimize our contract a little more to win.This time, let\u2019s go to Eigenphi and see which searcher actually won this trade:And the winner is Jared. No surprises there, but we\u2019d like to know how he did it.His frontrunning transaction looks like this:and his backrunning transaction like this:First, we check if our optimizations were done correctly. And it does seem like it is:Jared got a value of 2 something WETH as the optimized amount in value as well.However, this is the part where you\u2019ll start to get confused. You\u2019ll see that Jared has other trades in his frontrun and backrun transactions. And because of this, he is able to generate more profits compared to other sandwich bots.The revenue we could have expected is:0.0469 ETH * $2,300 (current ETH price) = $107.87wherease Jared is able to generate $160.This is because Jared is also doing arbitrage in his frontrun \/ backrun transactions.Let\u2019s briefly take a look at what he\u2019s doing in the frontrunning transaction:You can see that Jared is doing a 2-hop arbitrage between Uniswap V3 and V2. He was able to spot an arbitrage opportunity on dogwifhat pools in the two DEXs and add that in his frontrun transaction.How do we know that this is an arbitrage opportunity?Because Jared is trading on two pools:they are both paired up with:Well, that\u2019s a bummer\u2026because we can never win Jared now unless we implement arbitrage in our system as well.No need to get disappointed just yet, because it\u2019ll only get worse once you see how he\u2019s exiting out of his initial RSTK tokens (what the victim was trying to trade on Universal Router).His backrun transactions are quite complex as well. But it\u2019s a combination of sandwich and arbitrage just like the frontrunning transaction.Now, that\u2019s strange. I thought we only needed to exit out of the RSTK position using the initial Uniswap V2 pool, right?Not really, because if you think about it, there can be price differences on any different pools paired up with the same tokens, that means that an arbitrage opportunity might exist among these pools.And that\u2019s exactly what Jared is doing. Jared\u2019s bot detects a price discrepancy between Uniswap V3 and V2 RSTK pools and performs an arbitrage and get\u2019s an extra profit out of it.With this, he is able to earn at least $50 more on the same opportunity that we spotted.📍 There\u2019s so much more to learn from Jared actually. He is also doing:\n1. JIT liquidity provisioning in his frontrunning transactions, 2. picks up multiple victim transactions to sandwich them, 3. buys memecoins and performs non-WETH sandwich strategies using these tokens. But these are for after we\u2019ve mastered the art of simple sandwich + arbitrage strategies.I hope that this can give you an idea of how competitive you have to be to win in the Ethereum sandwich market nowadays.Let\u2019s try running our sandwich bot a bit longer:We can see that we\u2019re seeing sandwich opportunities every few blocks. And I hope you can try doing the same and run comparisons on:This will give you a very clear idea about how much more we have to optimize our code.In this section, we\u2019re finally going to try and send some real bundles to builder endpoints. As you have seen in the previous section though, our sandwich bundle will not be competitive yet, so don\u2019t expect you\u2019ll land bundles until we\u2019ve optimized the code a bit more.We\u2019ll still see how we can broadcast our bundles to multiple builders and see for ourselves how competitive this basic strategy is from Gambit Labs. We\u2019ll look at:The first step to take before we submit our bundles is to deploy our smart contract on the mainnet. We\u2019ll be using Foundry for this.Before we really deploy the given contract here:We\u2019ll quickly run some tests and see if all the functions work as intended.👉 First, let\u2019s see if we can send ETH and ERC-20 tokens to our contract and recover them back. One mistake I made when I was first starting out was forgetting to add this function and I had to look at my ETH get locked up in the contract. Hopefully we know that this won\u2019t happen with the Sandooo contract.Start an Anvil process by doing:I\u2019ll start a fork of the mainnet and run Anvil on port 2000.Next, write the test function for the contract as follows in sandooo\/contracts\/test\/Sandooo.t.sol:and run:and check the logs we get:You can see that we can safely recover our funds after we\u2019ve sent them to our contract.👉 Next, we\u2019ll try to make a simulated swap on a Uniswap V2 pair and confirm that our contract indeed works.Try adding this to the test function we wrote earlier:We\u2019ll try to buy some USDT using WETH.Try running the test with the command:and we\u2019ll get:We can see that the test succeeds.Now that we\u2019ve tested out our contracts and have seen that all our functions work well, we can deploy to mainnet.Luckily, this contract is very simple, so the compiled bytecode amounts to this: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\u2019s very short, don\u2019t you think?I tried deploying this on mainnet using the command:and I used 181,016 in gas, and at:used 0.00246 ETH to deploy the contract. That\u2019s $5.67.Try pulling from Github and you\u2019ll now see that the phase2 branch has been merged to our main branch.And there\u2019s the execution.rs file in sandooo\/src directory:If you\u2019re planning to test this out, please double check all the logic and take care! There\u2019re so many ways a contract deployment can go wrong, I always take extra steps to ensure I\u2019m not missing anything. (🛑 Also, don\u2019t trust what I tell you in this article, confirm the logic yourself before you can try things on the mainnet. As a matter of fact, don\u2019t trust anyone 🛑)Change the DEBUG field in .env file so that the code can run using real WETH in the contract:Make sure to add the real BOT_ADDRESS and PRIVATE_KEY of the address that was used to deploy the bot contract.I tried sending 0.5 WETH to the contract to test out my logic.With this, we can try running our bot:Now we wait, and pray everything goes well. 🙏I ended up sending one bundle 8 blocks after I started the system.We want to focus on the \u201CBundle sent\u201D part of our log this time:We see that we\u2019ve successfully sent to Gambit Labs, Flashbots, Rsync, Penguin Build, Titan Builder, Builder0x69, and Beaverbuild.We are interested in Gambit Labs, so let\u2019s head over to their website and check out the transaction hash and see what the competition is like:0x1924235bfe061560fd9725320cf4c26825422ea1aff42ec913a76e53370d7199This is the victim\u2019s transaction hash:You can checkout the auction status here, and our bundle is at the bottom of the competition:Compare our bribe amount to the top bidder who paid 0.009547 ETH as bribe. The top bidder is paying twice as much as we are.To see why this may be the case. Head on over to Eigenphi this time and see what the optimized amount in value was. Our value 0.39728 WETH.But our simulation is still fast enough as you can see from here:Our bundle is being sent well within a second and so we can conclude that network latency isn\u2019t the issue here.

Don\u2019t worry, we will. Our system is only doing Uniswap V2 sandwiches right now, and we can only handle single sandwich per bundle, so if we were already earning profits, then the market will be very boring.In the following 2 ~ 3 articles, we\u2019ll try to optimize this system as much as we can by adding:and see if we can compete with this system.Hint: We still can\u2019t. 🤣 But we\u2019ll get very very close.

I ignored the Monday Night Football game on TV and the conversation next to me about the day\u2019s writers\u2019 conference workshop because I was glued to a Twitter group chat called Fin\u2019s Beach Bar and Back Patio. The person sitting next to me must have noticed how much I was snickering as I scrolled my phone. \u201CYou look like you\u2019re having a great time,\u201D they said. \u201CWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201DDo I even try and explain? I wondered. \u201CJust my friends,\u201D I replied. I left out the part about the imaginary bar by the beach.In sociology, the term \u201Cthird places\u201D describes the places people spend time between home (\u201Cfirst\u201D place) and work (\u201Csecond\u201D place). Third places are where people gather primarily for social reasons and to build relationships. For many of the 200+ people across 3 group chats, our shared memes, creations, and inside jokes make Fin\u2019s a third place. We\u2019ve grown into a community with a unique culture and identity and we\u2019re ready to evolve. But before Fin\u2019s opens it\u2019s doors to more people, it\u2019s a good time to reflect and share:For the most part, Twitter group chats are spam: if you can DM someone, you can add them to a group chat without them having to accept the request. The feature itself is also hard to use\u200A\u2014 there\u2019s no search or reply context for example. Pretty quickly it became clear our chat needed a purpose \u2014 a reason to exist.Ultimately, the goal was to help connect people in the doodles\u2019 community with each other. But meaningful connections don\u2019t magically happen when you put people in a group chat together, so I needed something more \u2014 a structured approach that would help people come together. I set out to create an experience, based on a smart contract on the blockchain.Because the majority of the group came from the doodles community, I decided to \u201Creward\u201D everyone who stayed in the chat with a series of ERC1155 collectibles related to both the doodles\u2019 universe and the bar. I announced I\u2019d be air-dropping NFTs to people in the chat and began to collect wallet addresses. Interest grew, and before long a second group chat had formed \u2014 the line to get in to the bar.Belonging to a Fin\u2019s chat meant acting the part \u2014 for folks in the bar, they celebrated like VIPs who skip past the velvet rope at the hottest clubs. Fictitious drink specials were announced nightly. The people in the line complained about the wait, the rain, and the lack of food options. So far, the project was an improvisational exercise and everyone seemed into it.While I was writing a smart contract to effectively govern the rules of our social game, the group was vibing and memeing. One of the earliest group efforts was editing everyone\u2019s profile picture into a template of the doodles shark suit holding a Fin\u2019s sign. We also temporarily adopted the phrase \u201CIYKYK\u201D, adding them to our tweets with a shark emoji. The template was shared between both chats and resulted in a proliferation of shark-themed profile pictures on Twitter:With help from the geniuses at West Coast NFT, I developed a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain that effectively set up the rules for the game. The contract made it possible for me to send a maximum of 150 tokens each round for ten rounds. These tokens were designed to be \u201Cburned\u201D as a full set in order to redeem one final, ultimate token.This feels like a good time to emphasize how much it really helps to have a creative friend and partner. NFTSantana helped scheme out the possible evolutions of this project at every step of the way. He is the reason this was not all a complete flop by week 2.Because Fin\u2019s had two group chats of 75 people, we decided to gamify the distribution of the 150 tokens in a way that rewarded trust, cooperation, and helped people make new connections. Each week, I changed the mechanics of the airdrop:Because the distribution was unpredictable but the goal of obtaining one of each had been made clear, people found trading partners, made deals, and maneuvered their collections to accumulate full sets of these collectibles. (There was even a google spreadsheet created by the community to track token trades!) I didn\u2019t use rarity or scarcity to drive speculative value, which made it entirely possible to accumulate a full set by simply trading and participating and without spending any money (although there was a small amount of sales volume on secondary).After the first ten tokens had been issued, I designed a burn-to-redeem function that allowed people to submit a full set\u2014exactly one of each token \u2014 in exchange for a final, ultimate token.Over the 10 weeks Fin\u2019s was officially running, we had collaborations\/partnerships with a couple of different artists in the web3 space, including:These partnerships emerged organically, they weren\u2019t just allowlist spots. We worked with these teams to connect the creators and artists with the people in Fin\u2019s. Some brought templates; others airdropped NFTs to everyone in the bar and line. Many weeks, we welcomed the artists as guests to the chat and got to know them and learn about their work. Check out our zipsharks collab:For a while, I considered a future where Fin\u2019s was focused on launching and marketing projects. Would it be possible to tokenize grass-roots, organic marketing? It felt like a good idea \u2014 but this isn\u2019t what REALLY made Fin\u2019s a success. It was the relationships and sense of belonging that our shared purpose had helped grow and made us an effective partner. People weren\u2019t here to participate in a coordinated marketing campaign \u2014 they were here to have fun.I made a lot of adjustments over the course of the project. For example, one early goal was to create a 3D space that people could visit in their browser or in VR. Getting the exact details right was hard, and so I had to really reduce the scope of the art. I was also tempted to lean into the early hype and considered accelerating the project\u2019s timetable a lot.The initial concept was to \u201Cbuild\u201D Fin\u2019s in sections. Over a period of ten weeks, I\u2019d airdrop 10 different sections as NFTs. Together, they\u2019d assemble the full bar. This process ended up being a lot more difficult than I anticipated, because it was really hard to convey the concept of doodles-themed objects and get it done in a compressed amount of time.For example, one of the first pieces I commissioned was a single alley scene. But the more I gave feedback around color and perspective, the more the artist increased the project\u2019s scope. I had been very clear that I wanted a single wall in an alley \u2014 but what I got was a full city block:I also attempted to build a full composite of Fin\u2019s. And while I thought this artist was excellent at taking feedback, the scene just felt like it was missing something.I started to feel the hype kicking in. People were filling my DMs with requests to join Fin\u2019s. We had secondary sales after the first drop, and the art was well-received. I resisted leaning into the hype for a couple of reasons:Ultimately, I built the experience into an episodic series of weekly art drops and collaborations. Having a scheduled start and end helped set clear expectations. Spacing our project over 10 weeks had an affect on our art, too: because we weren\u2019t rushed, there was time to review and revise art with artists on a reasonable schedule and incorporate the emerging culture of the bar into some of the pieces.When I look back at the memory of eating dinner while I scrolled Fin\u2019s group chat, I realize that while I was physically in a bar lobby I was also in Fin\u2019s. But what made it a \u201Cthird place\u201D for so many of us?This is the closest we are to the metaverse today: it\u2019s possible to be one place physically while making memories with friends who are scattered around every corner of the globe at that same moment.So many NFT projects never end. They raise a lot of money and make large promises about utility or other products they\u2019ll deliver, which in turn drives the speculative value of their tokens. But Fin\u2019s was designed as a fun, social experience with an endgame in mind \u2014 because every good story eventually comes to an end.If you\u2019re curious about what\u2019s next for Fin\u2019s or would like to join us, you can get more information here:www.fins.wtf","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*y4T0LB0F9SybrtXPEH61lw.png","author":"deepbluesteeve","title":"The Bar at the Edge of the Metaverse","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@deepbluesteeve\/the-bar-at-the-edge-of-the-metaverse-9d1cee2b90c7","tags":["Nft","Blockchain","Nft Collectibles","Social Media","Twitter"]},{"summary":"Chamath Palihapitiya\u200A\u2014\u200A\"I'm a Warren Buffett disciple, but he's wrong about Bitcoin.\"","date":"Apr 22, 2024","post_content":"Everyone has a blind spot now and then.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*BEsgHnFkQeBoYlPd","author":"Jayden Levitt","title":"Billionaire Finance Expert Delivers Most Profound Response to Warren Buffett's Bitcoin Scepticism\u2026","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/gitconnected\/billionaire-finance-expert-delivers-most-profound-response-to-warren-buffetts-bitcoin-scepticism-b74d585822d6","tags":[]},{"summary":"TRENDING: Economic downturn is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, These are Factors behind the Market Downturn ..","date":null,"post_content":"The current economic downturn is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, including global market conditions, geopolitical events, and domestic policies, these are Factors behind the Market Downturn:","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*KOzm1wK51_5U-whHOs23lA.jpeg","author":"Izdnhussin","title":"Why Bitcoin Dump?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/izdnhussin\/why-bitcoin-dump-b12b33ed718d","tags":[]},{"summary":"As another big player collapses, trust is being eroded","date":"Nov 16, 2022","post_content":"The crypto market has just witnessed \u201Cone of history\u2019s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.\u201DI won\u2019t claim to fully understand the complexities of the saga involving the FTX exchange, Alameda Research and recently dethroned Crypto Golden Boy Sam\u2026","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*bqiK1RL0ejC2m_4O2JS5IQ.png","author":"Stephen Moore","title":"The Crypto Winter Is About to Become a Crypto Ice Age","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/entrepreneur-s-handbook\/the-crypto-winter-is-about-to-become-a-crypto-ice-age-9d12d71e4b10","tags":[]},{"summary":"UPDATE [April 25, 2024]: It appears that the 0g-evmos repository has been removed, making it no longer possible to set up the 0g-evmos\u2026","date":"Apr 13, 2024","post_content":"UPDATE [April 25, 2024]: It appears that the 0g-evmos repository has been removed, making it no longer possible to set up the 0g-evmos node. However, you might consider setting up a 0g-storage-node instead. As I don\u2019t currently have a guide for this, I recommend consulting the official documentation available here: 0g-storage-node Setup DocumentationA\nfter a brief break, I\u2019m back exploring exciting cryptocurrency projects, and today I\u2019m introducing 0G, short for ZeroGravity, a project that\u2019s developing a modular AI blockchain designed to transform AI dApps. This platform offers an easy-to-use environment for developers by using a scalable Data Availability (DA) layer that separates data handling into two parts: data publishing and data storage. This setup helps avoid bottlenecks and ensures that large data volumes can be managed efficiently and securely.0G stands out because it has a scalable system that doesn\u2019t just store data but also ensures it is easily accessible for anyone who needs it. This is important for applications that rely on fast and reliable data retrieval, such as AI technologies and advanced Layer 2 networks.The system works by allowing nodes to earn rewards not just for storing data but for proving that data is accessible when needed. This encourages nodes to perform well and helps the network scale effectively. 0G also supports a variety of data types, thanks to its multi-layer storage system that includes both unstructured and structured data management.Basically 0G.ai is not just creating a data storage solution; it\u2019s enhancing the accessibility and usability of data in blockchain applications, making it an exciting project to watch in the growing landscape of Web3 and decentralized technologies.0G Labs, the team behind 0G.ai, has successfully raised $35 million in a pre-seed funding round with support from notable investors like Alliance, Animoca Brands, Delphi Digital, Samsung Next, Symbolic Capital, and OKX Ventures. This funding highlights the strong interest and confidence in the project\u2019s potential.The project has already launched its Newton Testnet on April 10th, allowing for testing and further development. 0G Labs is also preparing for a significant step forward with the planned launch of its Mainnet in the third quarter of 2024, which will bring the platform fully online.To get started with installing your node, you\u2019ll first need to rent a VPS (Virtual Private Server). Using a VPS offers several advantages, such as enhanced performance, scalability and reliability. I\u2019ll guide you through the process of renting a VPS at a lower cost, and show you how to configure it. Follow the steps below to get your VPS ready for the node installation.Research VPS providers: Take some time to explore different VPS providers available in the market. Consider factors like pricing, reputation, and customer reviews to find the right fit for your needs. Look for plans that offer the appropriate amount of resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to support your node. Contabo is my preferred choice due to their combination of affordable pricing, reliable performance, and user-friendly interface.I personally use and trust Contabo for my blockchain nodes. I\u2019ve recently joined their affiliate program to recommend their services. If you decide to use my affiliate links for Contabo, you\u2019ll be supporting my work at no extra cost to you.

Thank you very much for your support!Minimum hardware specifications needed for this node:In setting up the node, we\u2019ll follow the recommended hardware guidelines and choose the Cloud VPS 2 package.I will initially select a rental period of 1 month, with the flexibility to extend it later if needed:Make sure to choose the option \u201CEuropean Union (Germany)\u201D:For the best storage solution, I recommend selecting the 400GB SSD storage type:Navigate to either the \u201CPopular\u201D or \u201COS\u201D tab and choose the standard Ubuntu 20.04 image from there:To prioritize security, I highly recommend to generate a password and securely store it to ensure maximum protection:For the final step, it\u2019s recommended to leave the sections titled \u201CObject Storage\u201D, \u201CNetworking\u201D, and \u201CAdd-Ons\u201D in their default state without any modifications. If you are new to Contabo, please create an account; otherwise, login using your existing credentials. Provide your personal data by filling in the required fields. Complete the remaining fields with your personal information, and click the \u201CNext\u201D button to proceed with the payment. After successfully completing the payment for your order, you will receive an initial email. Within approximately 15\u201330 minutes, you will receive a second email containing all the information needed to connect to your VPS.Download and install most recent edition of PuTTY by visiting the official website:You will find the IP adress of your VPS in the second email. Launch PuTTY, enter the IP address of your VPS and click \u201COpen\u201D:Once the server interface is open, you will be prompted to provide login details; simply enter \u201Croot\u201D as the user and use your chosen password:Congratulations! You are now successfully logged into your server:To continue, we can update the packages by running the following commands in the terminal. The first part of the command updates the package lists for upgrades, and the second part actually performs the upgrades with the \u201C-y\u201D flag allowing for automatic confirmation of prompts during the upgrade process:In this step, we\u2019re preparing the system by installing essential build tools. Specifically, curl and git are used for downloading and managing code repositories, jq for processing JSON data, lz4 for compression and decompression, and build-essential for compiling software from source etc.Make sure you install the latest version of GO, whether it\u2019s a fresh installation or an update:To install the latest version of the 0G-evmosd project from 0G Labs, you\u2019ll first need to download the project\u2019s source code from GitHub and then compile it:Check the releases page to see if there is a newer version than v1.0.0-testnet. If there is, replace v1.0.0-testnet with the latest version in the following command:Once you\u2019ve built the binaries for the 0G-evmosd project, you\u2019ll need to organize them for use with Cosmovisor, a process manager for Cosmos SDK applications:These steps ensure that your0G-evmosd binary is properly stored and managed for easy upgrades and maintenance using Cosmovisor. This setup helps in simplifying the update process and keeping your node operational with minimal downtime.To ensure the 0G-evmosd binary is easily accessible and managed effectively with Cosmovisor, we will create symlinks. These links will help in switching versions and managing the binary execution paths more efficiently:Cosmovisor is a important tool for managing updates and processes for Cosmos SDK applications like 0G-evmosd. It ensures seamless upgrades by automatically restarting the application with the new version without manual intervention:To ensure that your0G-evmosd node runs as a resilient and automatically restarting service, it's effective to configure it using systemd, a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. This setup allows the 0G-evmosd node to start at boot and keep running even if it encounters errors:To finalize the setup and ensure your0G-evmosd node service is operational and configured to start automatically when your system boots, follow these steps:To configure your node for operation, you\u2019ll need to set several parameters. This involves specifying the chain ID, keyring backend, and the node endpoint. These commands are important for properly configuring your node to interact with the network, manage keys securely, and communicate with other nodes effectively:To start setting up your node, we need to initialize it with a specific node name and chain ID. Before running the command, decide on a unique name for your node. This name will identify your node within the network. Replace YOUR_NODE_NAME with the actual name you\u2019ve chosen for your node:This command sets up the basic configuration for your node, including generating the necessary directories and files for operation. The --chain-id parameter ensures that your node is set up to connect to the specific blockchain network identified as zgtendermint_9000-1.The genesis file is a fundamental component of any blockchain network. It contains the initial configuration and state of the blockchain. For your node to correctly join and sync with the specified network, we need to download and place the genesis file in the correct directory:After downloading the genesis file, it\u2019s good practice to check that the file is not corrupted and is correctly placed. If the genesis file has been downloaded correctly and is complete, you can exit the text editor by pressing CTRL + X:To fully integrate your node into the network and configure it for proper communication, we\u2019ll need to update its configuration with the correct peers, seeds, and port numbers:Before making changes like a reset, it\u2019s important to backup the validator state. This file contains the state of your node\u2019s validator at the last block it signed:Download the latest blockchain state from a snapshot to quickly sync your node up to a recent block. This command streams a compressed snapshot file and extracts it directly into your .evmosd directory:After the snapshot is extracted and your node data is essentially reset, restore your original validator state to avoid any potential issues with block signing:To make sure that your service is updated with any configuration changes and is running smoothly, follow these steps:Many thanks to the Core Node Team for providing this snapshot. Their support has significantly reduced our setup time. Check them out on Twitter.To monitor the real-time logs of your service, you can use the journalctl command. This tool is part of the systemd suite and provides a powerful interface for querying and displaying logs from systemd and the services it manages, which is useful for troubleshooting and ensuring that your node is operating as expected:To create a new wallet on your node, you will need to use the following command. Replace YOUR_WALLET_NAME with your chosen wallet name in the command below. Decide on a name for your new wallet. For this example, I suggest using \u201Cwallet\u201D as the name to keep things straightforward:This command generates a new wallet including a public\/private key pair and gives you access to the associated address on the blockchain network.After you define a keyring passphrase, make sure to securely store the output, especially your mnemonic phrase, as it is essential for recovering your wallet if needed:To extract and convert your wallet address to the Ethereum hex format, you can use a combination of evmosd commands and shell utilities. If your wallet name is \"wallet\", here\u2019s how you should format your command:To export your wallet\u2019s Ethereum-compatible private key from the node, you\u2019ll need to use the unsafe-export-eth-key command. This command extracts the Ethereum private key from your Evmos wallet in an unencrypted format. Make sure you handle and store any output securely:To obtain testnet tokens, access the Faucet Page. Now, input your wallet address in the Ethereum hex format that you prepared earlier and complete the captcha. Next, click on the \u201CRequest A0GI Token\u201D button to initiate the token transfer.Once the transaction is processed, you should see a \u201CTransaction Successful\u201D message indicating that the tokens have been transferred to your wallet:Check the Sync Status: To verify if your node has completed syncing with the blockchain, use this command:When catching_up is false, your node is fully synced and ready for the next steps. This indicates that your node is up-to-date with the latest blockchain state and can participate in the network. The output will look like this:Before you proceed with creating your validator, make sure that you have received the testnet tokens in your account. You can check your wallet\u2019s balance by using the following command:Expected output:Now you\u2019re set to run the create-validator command. Make sure to replace YOUR_MONIKER with your node\u2019s name. If you have a website, replace YOUR_WEBSITE with its URL; if not, you can leave it empty. Then, replace YOUR_DETAILS with information about yourself as a node operator:Expected output:To delegate tokens to your node, use the command provided below. As of this writing, you must delegate a minimum of 1 A0GI to rank within the top 500. Your ranking is determined by the amount of aevmos you delegate. Here\u2019s how the conversion works:To check your validator status you can run this command, which will also display your operator address:Next, navigate to the ⚡┃node-status channel on the 0G Discord server and type !val followed by your operator address. For example:You should see an output similar to the example below. Please be aware that as of this writing, you need to delegate a minimum of 1 aevmos for your status to change to \u201Cactive\u201D:Next, import your wallet into Metamask by using the private key you exported earlier in Step 16. For detailed guidance on importing an account into Metamask, you can read the instructions here. Then, visit the 0G scan and connect your wallet.

In the recent\u2026","date":null,"post_content":"Trust, efficiency and verifiability are significant blockers to the widespread use of decentralized AI compute and inference. In the recent past, techniques leveraging zero-knowledge proof (zkML) or optimistic assumptions and fraud proofs (opML) have emerged as potential solutions to these problems, but each of these has drawbacks that make it economically infeasible, technically impractical or both.Today, following months of collaboration with our research partners at UC Berkeley and Columbia , Hyperbolic is proud to introduce the first practical solution to this growth blocker based on a new verification mechanism we call Proof-of-Sampling, or PoSP for short.Read the full paper hereProof of Sampling (PoSP) uses sampling techniques and game theory to ensure security and efficiency by creating a system where all participants are incentivized to act honestly. At the heart of this method is an incentive structure that rewards actors for acting honestly and penalizes those who do not. By randomly selecting and verifying transactions, PoSP reduces the computational burden on the network, making it a scalable solution for decentralized systems.Read a detailed breakdown of PosP hereHere\u2019s how PoSP works:The same philosophy also exists in the real world. In the Swiss bus system, instead of checking every passenger\u2019s ticket on every trip, inspectors conduct random checks. The penalty is so high that no one will try to avoid paying for the tickets.The Hyperbolic research team conducted rigorous mathematical analysis and showed that as long as the probability of challenge is higher than a certain threshold based on the parameters of the setup, this PoSP achieves what is known in game theory as a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. It\u2019s a state where all participants in the network are incentivized to act honestly because any other strategy would be less beneficial. In other words, when the system is set up correctly, with rewards and penalties balanced against the probability of being challenged, the most rational and profitable approach for all nodes is to compute the result accurately.Building on the principles of PoSP, Hyperbolic has developed spML, an implementation of PoSP designed specifically for decentralized AI inference. SpML addresses the limitations of existing verification mechanisms, such as opML (which relies on fraud proofs) and zkML (which uses zero-knowledge proofs).OpML is theoretically secure provided there is at least one honest validator verifying the outcomes. However, the absence of an incentive mechanism to ensure the presence of such a validator renders it susceptible to undetected fraud. ZkML, on the other hand, enhances security and privacy but suffers from high computational overhead, limiting scalability and efficiency.SpML utilizes an effective method to ensure both rapid processing and high security without the computational overhead associated with zkML or the vulnerability to fraud seen in opML. With spML, the protocol enhances security by randomly challenging the outcome by another validator. The asserter is unaware of whether their results will be challenged or which validator will be selected to perform the challenge, ensuring an unbiased verification process. If their outputs match, the transaction is considered valid, and the servers are rewarded. If there\u2019s a discrepancy, the network votes to resolve the issue, maintaining system integrity and trust.Read a detailed breakdown of spML hereSo, spML improves on opML and zkML by synthesizing their strengths and effectively addressing their weaknesses. It offers better security than opML by reducing the probability of undetected fraud, while maintaining scalability and efficiency. Compared to zkML on the other hand, spML provides a more scalable and efficient solution by reducing the computational overhead associated with zero-knowledge proofs, while still ensuring a high level of security through its sampling-based approach.By combining the best aspects of both opML and zkML, spML provides a simple, practical and effective solution for decentralized AI applications.PoSP and spML have a significant impact on decentralized AI systems. By providing scalable, secure, and efficient verification mechanisms, these solutions enable the development of decentralized AI networks that can handle large-scale operations without compromising trust or performance.One of the key applications is in decentralized AI inference, where users can be confident that the correct model is being used. This ensures that they receive high-quality, trustworthy results without relying on a single centralized entity. This technology has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields where trustworthy AI is essential, including virtual assistants, robotics, content creation, and on-chain transactions.Moreover, spML\u2019s sampling-based approach enables the creation of decentralized AI marketplaces, where providers can offer their AI models and services in a trustless and permissionless manner. This opens up new opportunities for AI developers and researchers to monetize their work and collaborate with others in the field, driving innovation and accelerating the progress of AI technologies.In the future, the PoSP protocol has significant potential for use in various decentralized systems. As suggested in the paper, it could improve the security of blockchain layer 2 solutions by ensuring pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. The protocol is also ideally suited for Actively Validated Services (AVS), enhancing security and reliability in restaking protocols like EigenLayer or Exocore. This exploration will result in innovative applications that leverage the strengths of PoSP to create robust, scalable, and secure systems.At Hyperbolic, our mission is to make AI accessible to everyone by advancing decentralized technologies through novel solutions like PoSP and spML. We\u2019re building secure, scalable, and efficient verification mechanisms for decentralized AI systems that will enable anyone with an idea to harness the power of AI.By creating an open-access AI ecosystem, we aim to democratize the field and unlock the untapped potential of people from all over the world. Our goal is to break down the barriers preventing many from engaging with AI technology, creating a more inclusive and collaborative approach to AI development.We\u2019re excited about the possibilities PoSP and spML open up for the future.

Such technology in recent years is obviously that of blockchain, which has seen significant growth with its promise and potential for decentralized transaction processes and a new level of efficiency and security. It particularly impacts sectors like financial services, insurance, and supply chains. And its ability to facilitate monetary exchanges and communication between parties without the need for intermediaries is what makes it invaluable. Moreover, blockchain enhances data integrity and process transparency \u2014 qualities that are crucial in managing today\u2019s complex supply chains characterized by pressing needs around traceability and integrity.Effective supply chain management is a major differentiator in the competitiveness game for all companies, involving intricate coordination between producers, suppliers, distributors, and government bodies. Managing these relationships requires not only innovative technology like blockchain but also a strategic approach to overcome the complexities and minimize costs effectively.The onset of COVID-19 dramatically reshaped consumer expectations and exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains. If before the pandemic, consumers enjoyed the luxury of two-hour delivery windows for a wide array of products, the new set up that the pandemic brought highlighted the critical importance of efficient supply chain systems as delays became commonplace, affecting essential and leisure products alike.The challenges extend beyond pandemic-related disruptions. Supply chains today also grapple with geopolitical tensions, cyber threats, environmental changes, and more. These factors compel companies to reevaluate their strategies, moving away from just-in-time models to more resilient approaches.According to a Deloitte report, within this new level of complexity of the markets, supply chain executives are prioritizing three key areas to enhance supply chain resilience:Blockchain technology serves as a decentralized ledger that not only enhances transparency but also secures data against tampering, making it ideal for complex supply chains where traditional trust mechanisms falter.For instance, in resource-heavy industries, blockchain facilitates detailed tracking of Scope 3 emissions, allowing companies to manage their environmental impact more effectively. Additionally, by ensuring data integrity and transparency, blockchain enhances trust among various supply chain participants, from producers to end consumers.The rapid evolution within tech demands a deep understanding of these innovations, especially their capability to handle and process data effectively. Despite extensive advancements, numerous challenges persist in supply chain management \u2014 issues such as transparency in transportation processes, supply, and information management remain largely unaddressed.Yes, blockchain\u2019s attributes \u2014 transparency, decentralization, verifiability, and traceability \u2014 are, indeed, drawing attention. Yet, there\u2019s a crucial need for robust tools to implement these technologies effectively across different sectors to maximize their benefits, including enhanced monitoring, auditing, and compliance capabilities.Scalability Challenges: The expansion of blockchain applications highlights the need for scalable solutions that can handle increased transaction volumes without compromising speed or security. Public blockchains, in particular, struggle with these demands due to their larger network size.As we previously emphasized, data visibility and trust are often lacking in today\u2019s complex world of supply chains, which translates as big problems for businesses and consumers alike. SourceLess blockchain technology aims at solving this type of challenges by enabling supply chain partners to share verified data through secure, permissioned blockchain solutions. At the same type the company has been working on solving the interoperability, scalability, security and privacy challenges presented above with its patented technologies and hybrid blockchain platform.In our era marked by frequent major disruptions like global pandemics and trade conflicts \u2014 the ability to verify product authenticity and ensure responsible sourcing has become top priority. Consumers increasingly demand transparency from brands, while businesses seek to minimize disputes and enhance operational efficiency.SourceLess Blockchain helps supply chain leaders to harness data effectively, not only to manage current disruptions but also to build long-term resilience. By facilitating trusted data exchange and improving transparency, blockchain solutions lay the foundation for a more reliable and reliable supply chain ecosystem.As factories evolve towards smarter systems, traditional network security solutions no longer meet the complex requirements of modern business and user needs. Blockchain\u2019s inherent security features, ensuring data credibility and global state consistency, offer a compelling solution.For more information on how SourceLess Blockchain can revolutionize your supply chain, visit www.sourceless.io.Additional references:\nScienceDirect \u2014 Blockchain for Supply Chain Management: A Literature Review and Open Challenges","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*R-bfvrPtUog7lIZVgtqKVQ.png","author":"SourceLess","title":"Blockchain in Supply Chains: Enhancing Transparency, Reducing Risks","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@sourcelessblockchain\/blockchain-in-supply-chains-enhancing-transparency-reducing-risks-b925f4b429f2","tags":[]},{"summary":"This article is meant to provide an overview of the project and to help you make an educated decision on whether to invest your\u2026","date":null,"post_content":"C\nARV Protocol is a modular data layer that facilitates data exchange and value distribution across the gaming and AI sectors.

Leveraging Miner Extractable Value (MEV), the bot strategically exploits opportunities by analyzing and capitalizing on transaction ordering variations that can occur due to miner influence.This automated tool aims to optimize profits by identifying and executing trades in a way that maximizes gains from MEV. MEV Arbitrage Bots play a crucial role in the competitive landscape of DeFi, providing traders with a powerful means to navigate and capitalize on the dynamic nature of blockchain transactions.MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bot strategies encompass a variety of techniques and approaches to exploit profit opportunities within blockchain transactions, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Here are some common types of MEV bot strategies:》 Front-Running:MEV bots observe pending transactions and quickly submit their own transactions with higher gas fees to get executed before the original transactions. This strategy is often employed to take advantage of anticipated price movements caused by the initial transaction.》 Back-Running:In contrast to front-running, back-running involves submitting a transaction after a known transaction has been submitted but before it is confirmed. MEV bots may exploit situations where they anticipate a market movement caused by the original transaction.》 Sandwich Attacks:Sandwich attacks involve placing two transactions around a target transaction to maximize profit. MEV bots submit a transaction before and after the target transaction, taking advantage of price movements caused by the target transaction.》 Arbitrage Opportunities:MEV bots identify and exploit price differences between different decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, or markets. They execute trades quickly to capture the price discrepancy before it normalizes.》 Flash Loans:MEV bots use flash loans to borrow a large sum of assets and perform a series of transactions within the same transaction block. This strategy allows them to exploit market inefficiencies and repay the loan in the same block.》 Smart Contract Manipulation:MEV bots interact with smart contracts in ways that allow them to extract additional value. This may involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the contract code, manipulating the order of execution, or taking advantage of conditional statements within smart contracts.》 Transaction Insertion:MEV bots may insert their own transactions into the pending transaction pool, strategically positioning them to take advantage of market movements. This can involve predicting the outcome of certain transactions and opportunistically inserting their own to capitalize on the market impact.》 Liquidation Sniping:MEV bots monitor and exploit opportunities to liquidate positions in decentralized lending and borrowing platforms. They can quickly trigger liquidation events by submitting transactions at the right moment to profit from the resulting price movements.》 Oracle Exploitation:MEV bots may target decentralized applications relying on external data or oracles. By manipulating the timing of transactions based on oracle updates, they can exploit discrepancies and gain advantages in trading or other financial activities.It\u2019s important to note that the landscape of MEV bot strategies is dynamic, and new approaches may emerge as blockchain technology evolves. Additionally, the development of countermeasures and improved transaction ordering mechanisms is an ongoing area of research within the blockchain community.The features of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bots are characterized by their capabilities to identify, exploit, and maximize profit opportunities within blockchain transactions, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments. Here are key features associated with MEV bots:⇏ Transaction Monitoring:● MEV bots continuously monitor the mempool (the pool of pending transactions) to identify potential opportunities for profit. They analyze incoming transactions to determine which ones can be strategically exploited.⇏ Real-Time Decision-Making:● MEV bots operate in real-time, making rapid decisions based on the constantly changing conditions of the blockchain network. This allows them to quickly respond to market movements and execute transactions within the same block.⇏ Gas Fee Optimization:● MEV bots are programmed to optimize gas fees, submitting transactions with higher fees to increase the likelihood of being included in the next block. This is crucial for front-running and other time-sensitive strategies.⇏ Front-Running Capability:● Front-running is a key feature of MEV bot development, enabling them to place transactions ahead of others in the queue to take advantage of anticipated market movements and secure more favorable prices.⇏ Back-Running Capability:● MEV bots can also engage in back-running, submitting transactions after a known transaction but before it is confirmed. This strategy allows them to profit from predicted market reactions.⇏ Sandwich Attack Execution:● MEV bots are capable of executing sandwich attacks by strategically placing buy and sell transactions around a target transaction. This tactic aims to capitalize on price movements caused by the target transaction.⇏ Arbitrage Execution:● MEV bots identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities by quickly executing trades to capitalize on price differences across different decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, or markets.⇏ Flash Loan Utilization:● Some MEV bots utilize flash loans, enabling them to borrow and repay a large sum of assets within the same transaction. This strategy allows for the execution of complex trades and arbitrage opportunities without the need for substantial capital.⇏ Smart Contract Interaction:● MEV bots interact with smart contracts, exploiting vulnerabilities or manipulating the order of execution to extract additional value. This may involve taking advantage of specific conditions within smart contracts.⇏ Adaptability to Network Conditions:● MEV bots are designed to adapt to varying network conditions, adjusting their strategies based on factors such as gas prices, network congestion, and the overall market environment.⇏ Efficient Use of Blockchain Data:● MEV bots efficiently analyze and utilize blockchain data to make informed decisions. This involves tracking transaction histories, market prices, and other relevant information to optimize their strategies.It\u2019s worth noting that MEV bot strategies and features may evolve over time as new developments in blockchain technology and DeFi ecosystems emerge. Additionally, efforts are being made to develop mechanisms to mitigate the impact of MEV on decentralized systems and promote fairness within blockchain transactions.While Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bots have been a subject of controversy due to their potential for manipulating decentralized systems, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that the development of MEV bots comes with certain perceived benefits for users and developers. However, it\u2019s crucial to consider these benefits in the context of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem:It\u2019s important to note that while these potential benefits exist, MEV and MEV bots have raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community. Issues such as unfair advantages, the potential for market manipulation, and the negative impact on the decentralization ethos of blockchain networks are among the challenges associated with MEV.Developers, regulators, and the community continue to explore ways to address these concerns and promote a fair and transparent environment within blockchain ecosystems. Solutions include the development of alternative transaction ordering mechanisms, the implementation of fee models that mitigate MEV incentives, and ongoing research into governance and protocol changes to create more equitable systems.In conclusion, embarking on the journey to build a MEV Arbitrage Trading Bot from scratch offers more than just a technical accomplishment; it opens doors to a nuanced understanding of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain dynamics.

The software I\u2019ve written has been used by millions of users, hundreds of\u2026","date":"Jan 15, 2016","post_content":"I\u2019ve spent more than 5 years being a Bitcoin developer. The software I\u2019ve written has been used by millions of users, hundreds of developers, and the talks I\u2019ve given have led directly to the creation of several startups. I\u2019ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.From the start, I\u2019ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. So don\u2019t invest what you can\u2019t afford to lose. I\u2019ve said this in interviews, on stage at conferences, and over email. So have other well known developers like Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked \u201Csystemically important institutions\u201D and \u201Ctoo big to fail\u201D has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there\u2019s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.Think about it. If you had never heard about Bitcoin before, would you care about a payments network that:I\u2019m going to hazard a guess that the answer is no.In case you haven\u2019t been keeping up with Bitcoin, here is how the network looks as of January 2016.The block chain is full. You may wonder how it is possible for what is essentially a series of files to be \u201Cfull\u201D. The answer is that an entirely artificial capacity cap of one megabyte per block, put in place as a temporary kludge a long time ago, has not been removed and as a result the network\u2019s capacity is now almost completely exhausted.Here\u2019s a graph of block sizes.The peak level in July was reached during a denial-of-service attack in which someone flooded the network with transactions in an attempt to break things, calling it a \u201Cstress test\u201D. So that level, about 700 kilobytes of transactions (or less than 3 payments per second), is probably about the limit of what Bitcoin can actually achieve in practiceThe reason the true limit seems to be 700 kilobytes instead of the theoretical 1000 is that sometimes miners produce blocks smaller than allowed and even empty blocks, despite that there are lots of transactions waiting to confirm \u2014 this seems to be most frequently caused by interference from the Chinese \u201CGreat Firewall\u201D censorship system. More on that in a second.If you look closely, you can see that traffic has been growing since the end of the 2015 summer months. This is expected. I wrote about Bitcoin\u2019s seasonal growth patterns back in March.Here\u2019s weekly average block sizes:So the average is nearly at the peak of what can be done. Not surprisingly then, there are frequent periods in which Bitcoin can\u2019t keep up with the transaction load being placed upon it and almost all blocks are the maximum size, even when there is a long queue of transactions waiting. You can see this in the size column (the 750kb blocks come from miners that haven\u2019t properly adjusted their software):When networks run out of capacity, they get really unreliable. That\u2019s why so many online attacks are based around simply flooding a target computer with traffic. Sure enough, just before Christmas payments started to become unreliable and at peak times backlogs are now becoming common.Quoting a news post by ProHashing, a Bitcoin-using business:ProHashing encountered another near-miss between Christmas and New Year, this time because a payment from an exchange to their wallet was delayed.Bitcoin is supposed to respond to this situation with automatic fee rises to try and get rid of some users, and although the mechanisms behind it are barely functional that\u2019s still sort of happening: it is rapidly becoming more and more expensive to use the Bitcoin network. Once upon a time, Bitcoin had the killer advantage of low and even zero fees, but it\u2019s now common to be asked to pay more to miners than a credit card would charge.Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.Why are they not allowing it to grow? Several reasons. One is that the developers of the \u201CBitcoin Core\u201D software that they run have refused to implement the necessary changes. Another is that the miners refuse to switch to any competing product, as they perceive doing so as \u201Cdisloyalty\u201D \u2014and they\u2019re terrified of doing anything that might make the news as a \u201Csplit\u201D and cause investor panic. They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.And the final reason is that the Chinese internet is so broken by their government\u2019s firewall that moving data across the border barely works at all, with speeds routinely worse than what mobile phones provide. Imagine an entire country connected to the rest of the world by cheap hotel wifi, and you\u2019ve got the picture. Right now, the Chinese miners are able to \u2014 just about \u2014 maintain their connection to the global internet and claim the 25 BTC reward ($11,000) that each block they create gives them. But if the Bitcoin network got more popular, they fear taking part would get too difficult and they\u2019d lose their income stream. This gives them a perverse financial incentive to actually try and stop Bitcoin becoming popular.Many Bitcoin users and observers have been assuming up until very recently that somehow these problems would all sort themselves out, and of course the block chain size limit would be raised. After all, why would the Bitcoin community \u2026 the community that has championed the block chain as the future of finance \u2026 deliberately kill itself by strangling the chain in its crib? But that\u2019s exactly what is happening.The resulting civil war has seen Coinbase \u2014 the largest and best known Bitcoin startup in the USA \u2014 be erased from the official Bitcoin website for picking the \u201Cwrong\u201D side and banned from the community forums. When parts of the community are viciously turning on the people that have introduced millions of users to the currency, you know things have got really crazy.If you haven\u2019t heard much about this, you aren\u2019t alone. One of the most disturbing things that took place over the course of 2015 is that the flow of information to investors and users has dried up.In the span of only about eight months, Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners. This transformation is by far the most appalling thing I have ever seen, and the result is that I no longer feel comfortable being associated with the Bitcoin community.Bitcoin is not intended to be an investment and has always been advertised pretty accurately: as an experimental currency which you shouldn\u2019t buy more of than you can afford to lose. It is complex, but that never worried me because all the information an investor might want was out there, and there\u2019s an entire cottage industry of books, conferences, videos and websites to help people make sense of it all.That has now changed.Most people who own Bitcoin learn about it through the mainstream media. Whenever a story goes mainstream the Bitcoin price goes crazy, then the media report on the price rises and a bubble happens.Stories about Bitcoin reach newspapers and magazines through a simple process: the news starts in a community forum, then it\u2019s picked up by a more specialised community\/tech news website, then journalists at general media outlets see the story on those sites and write their own versions. I\u2019ve seen this happen over and over again, and frequently taken part in it by discussing stories with journalists.In August 2015 it became clear that due to severe mismanagement, the \u201CBitcoin Core\u201D project that maintains the program that runs the peer-to-peer network wasn\u2019t going to release a version that raised the block size limit. The reasons for this are complicated and discussed below. But obviously, the community needed the ability to keep adding new users. So some long-term developers (including me) got together and developed the necessary code to raise the limit. That code was called BIP 101 and we released it in a modified version of the software that we branded Bitcoin XT. By running XT, miners could cast a vote for changing the limit. Once 75% of blocks were voting for the change the rules would be adjusted and bigger blocks would be allowed.The release of Bitcoin XT somehow pushed powerful emotional buttons in a small number of people. One of them was a guy who is the admin of the bitcoin.org website and top discussion forums. He had frequently allowed discussion of outright criminal activity on the forums he controlled, on the grounds of freedom of speech. But when XT launched, he made a surprising decision. XT, he claimed, did not represent the \u201Cdeveloper consensus\u201D and was therefore not really Bitcoin. Voting was an abomination, he said, because:So he decided to do whatever it took to kill XT completely, starting with censorship of Bitcoin\u2019s primary communication channels: any post that mentioned the words \u201CBitcoin XT\u201D was erased from the discussion forums he controlled, XT could not be mentioned or linked to from anywhere on the official bitcoin.org website and, of course, anyone attempting to point users to other uncensored forums was also banned. Massive numbers of users were expelled from the forums and prevented from expressing their views.As you can imagine, this enraged people. Read the comments on the announcement to get a feel for it.Eventually, some users found their way to a new uncensored forum. Reading it is a sad thing. Every day for months I have seen raging, angry posts railing against the censors, vowing that they will be defeated.But the inability to get news about XT or the censorship itself through to users has some problematic effects.For the first time, investors have no obvious way to get a clear picture of what\u2019s going on. Dissenting views are being systematically suppressed. Technical criticisms of what Bitcoin Core is doing are being banned, with misleading nonsense being peddled in its place. And it\u2019s clear that many people who casually bought into Bitcoin during one of its hype cycles have no idea that the system is about to hit an artificial limit.This worries me a great deal. Over the years governments have passed a large number of laws around securities and investments. Bitcoin is not a security and I do not believe it falls under those laws, but their spirit is simple enough: make sure investors are informed. When misinformed investors lose money, government attention frequently follows.People problems.When Satoshi left, he handed over the reins of the program we now call Bitcoin Core to Gavin Andresen, an early contributor. Gavin is a solid and experienced leader who can see the big picture. His reliable technical judgement is one of the reasons I had the confidence to quit Google (where I had spent nearly 8 years) and work on Bitcoin full time. Only one tiny problem: Satoshi never actually asked Gavin if he wanted the job, and in fact he didn\u2019t. So the first thing Gavin did was grant four other developers access to the code as well. These developers were chosen quickly in order to ensure the project could easily continue if anything happened to him. They were, essentially, whoever was around and making themselves useful at the time.One of them, Gregory Maxwell, had an unusual set of views: he once claimed he had mathematically proven Bitcoin to be impossible. More problematically, he did not believe in Satoshi\u2019s original vision.When the project was first announced, Satoshi was asked how a block chain could scale to a large number of payments. Surely the amount of data to download would become overwhelming if the idea took off? This was a popular criticism of Bitcoin in the early days and Satoshi fully expected to be asked about it. He said:It\u2019s a simple argument: look at what existing payment networks handle, look at what it\u2019d take for Bitcoin to do the same, and then point out that growth doesn\u2019t happen overnight. The networks and computers of the future will be better than today. And indeed back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that, as he said to me, \u201Cit never really hits a scale ceiling\u201D even when looking at more factors than just bandwidth.Maxwell did not agree with this line of thinking. From an interview in December 2014:The idea that Bitcoin is inherently doomed because more users means less decentralisation is a pernicious one. It ignores the fact that despite all the hype, real usage is low, growing slowly and technology gets better over time. It is a belief Gavin and I have spent much time debunking. And it leads to an obvious but crazy conclusion: if decentralisation is what makes Bitcoin good, and growth threatens decentralisation, then Bitcoin should not be allowed to grow.Instead, Maxwell concluded, Bitcoin should become a sort of settlement layer for some vaguely defined, as yet un-created non-blockchain based system.In a company, someone who did not share the goals of the organisation would be dealt with in a simple way: by firing him.But Bitcoin Core is an open source project, not a company. Once the 5 developers with commit access to the code had been chosen and Gavin had decided he did not want to be the leader, there was no procedure in place to ever remove one. And there was no interview or screening process to ensure they actually agreed with the project\u2019s goals.As Bitcoin became more popular and traffic started approaching the 1mb limit, the topic of raising the block size limit was occasionally brought up between the developers. But it quickly became an emotionally charged subject. Accusations were thrown around that raising the limit was too risky, that it was against decentralisation, and so on. Like many small groups, people prefer to avoid conflict. The can was kicked down the road.Complicating things further, Maxwell founded a company that then hired several other developers. Not surprisingly, their views then started to change to align with that of their new boss.Co-ordinating software upgrades takes time, and so in May 2015 Gavin decided the subject must be tackled once and for all, whilst there was still about 8 months remaining. He began writing articles that worked through the arguments against raising the limit, one at a time.But it quickly became apparent that the Bitcoin Core developers were hopelessly at loggerheads. Maxwell and the developers he had hired refused to contemplate any increase in the limit whatsoever. They were barely even willing to talk about the issue. They insisted that nothing be done without \u201Cconsensus\u201D. And the developer who was responsible for making the releases was so afraid of conflict that he decided any controversial topic in which one side might \u201Cwin\u201D simply could not be touched at all, and refused to get involved.Thus despite the fact that exchanges, users, wallet developers, and miners were all expecting a rise, and indeed, had been building entire businesses around the assumption that it would happen, 3 of the 5 developers refused to touch the limit.Deadlock.Meanwhile, the clock was ticking.Despite the news blockade, within a few days of launching Bitcoin XT around 15% of all network nodes were running it, and at least one mining pool had started offering BIP101 voting to miners.That\u2019s when the denial of service attacks started. The attacks were so large that they disconnected entire regions from the internet:In other cases, entire datacenters were disconnected from the internet until the single XT node inside them was stopped. About a third of the nodes were attacked and removed from the internet in this way.Worse, the mining pool that had been offering BIP101 was also attacked and forced to stop. The message was clear: anyone who supported bigger blocks, or even allowed other people to vote for them, would be assaulted.The attackers are still out there. When Coinbase, months after the launch, announced they had finally lost patience with Core and would run XT, they too were forced offline for a while.Despite the DoS attacks and censorship, XT was gaining momentum. That posed a threat to Core, so a few of its developers decided to organise a series of conferences named \u201CScaling Bitcoin\u201D: one in August and one in December. The goal, it was claimed, was to reach \u201Cconsensus\u201D on what should be done. Everyone likes a consensus of experts, don\u2019t they?It was immediately clear to me that people who refused to even talk about raising the limit would not have a change of heart because they attended a conference, and moreover, with the start of the winter growth season there remained only a few months to get the network upgraded. Wasting those precious months waiting for conferences would put the stability of the entire network at risk. The fact that the first conference actually banned discussion of concrete proposals didn\u2019t help.So I didn\u2019t go.Unfortunately, this tactic was devastatingly effective. The community fell for it completely. When talking to miners and startups, \u201Cwe are waiting for Core to raise the limit in December\u201D was one of the most commonly cited reasons for refusing to run XT. They were terrified of any media stories about a community split that might hurt the Bitcoin price and thus, their earnings.Now the last conference has come and gone with no plan to raise the limit, some companies (like Coinbase and BTCC) have woken up to the fact that they got played. But too late. Whilst the community was waiting, organic growth added another 100,000 transactions per day.Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, the two of five Bitcoin Core committers who support a block size increase (and the two who have been around the longest), both have a stellar reputation within the community. They recently wrote a joint article titled \u201CBitcoin is Being Hot-Wired for Settlement\u201D.Jeff and Gavin are generally softer in their approach than I am. I\u2019m more of a tell-it-like-I-see-it kinda guy, or as Gavin has delicately put it, \u201Chonest to a fault\u201D. So the strong language in their joint letter is unusual. They don\u2019t pull any punches:Failing to speak plainly, as they put it, has become more and more common. As an example, the plan Gavin and Jeff refer to was announced at the \u201CScaling Bitcoin\u201D conferences but doesn\u2019t involve making anything more efficient, and manages an anemic 60% capacity increase only through an accounting trick (not counting some of the bytes in each transaction). It requires making huge changes to nearly every piece of Bitcoin-related software. Instead of doing a simple thing and raising the limit, it chooses to do an incredibly complicated thing that might buy months at most, assuming a huge coordinated effort.One problem with using fees to control congestion is that the fee to get to the front of the queue might change after you made a payment. Bitcoin Core has a brilliant solution to this problem \u2014 allow people to mark their payments as changeable after they\u2019ve been sent, up until they appear in the block chain. The stated intention is to let people adjust the fee paid, but in fact their change also allows people to change the payment to point back to themselves, thus reversing it.At a stroke, this makes using Bitcoin useless for actually buying things, as you\u2019d have to wait for a buyer\u2019s transaction to appear in the block chain \u2026 which from now on can take hours rather than minutes, due to the congestion.Core\u2019s reasoning for why this is OK goes like this: it\u2019s no big loss because if you hadn\u2019t been waiting for a block before, there was a theoretical risk of payment fraud, which means you weren\u2019t using Bitcoin properly. Thus, making that risk a 100% certainty doesn\u2019t really change anything.In other words, they don\u2019t recognise that risk management exists and so perceive this change as zero cost.This protocol change will be released with the next version of Core (0.12), so will activate when the miners upgrade. It was massively condemned by the entire Bitcoin community but the remaining Bitcoin Core developers don\u2019t care what other people think, so the change will happen.If that didn\u2019t convince you Bitcoin has serious problems, nothing will. How many people would think bitcoins are worth hundreds of dollars each when you soon won\u2019t be able to use them in actual shops?Bitcoin has entered exceptionally dangerous waters. Previous crises, like the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, were all to do with the services and companies that sprung up around the ecosystem. But this one is different: it is a crisis of the core system, the block chain itself.More fundamentally, it is a crisis that reflects deep philosophical differences in how people view the world: either as one that should be ruled by a \u201Cconsensus of experts\u201D, or through ordinary people picking whatever policies make sense to them.Even if a new team was built to replace Bitcoin Core, the problem of mining power being concentrated behind the Great Firewall would remain. Bitcoin has no future whilst it\u2019s controlled by fewer than 10 people. And there\u2019s no solution in sight for this problem: nobody even has any suggestions. For a community that has always worried about the block chain being taken over by an oppressive government, it is a rich irony.Still, all is not yet lost. Despite everything that has happened, in the past few weeks more members of the community have started picking things up from where I am putting them down. Where making an alternative to Core was once seen as renegade, there are now two more forks vying for attention (Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited). So far they\u2019ve hit the same problems as XT but it\u2019s possible a fresh set of faces could find a way to make progress.There are many talented and energetic people working in the Bitcoin space, and in the past five years I\u2019ve had the pleasure of getting to know many of them. Their entrepreneurial spirit and alternative perspectives on money, economics and politics were fascinating to experience, and despite how it\u2019s all gone down I don\u2019t regret my time with the project. I woke up this morning to find people wishing me well in the uncensored forum and asking me to stay, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve moved on to other things. To those people I say: good luck, stay strong, and I wish you the best.[I wrote a short followup addressing some of the sillier conspiracy theories that have surfaced in the wake of this article]","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*gFnW6w5ThG0MiyL3IBndPw.png","author":"Mike Hearn","title":"The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/mike-hearn\/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7","tags":[]},{"summary":"These chart patterns will help you to identify and anticipate future market moves.","date":null,"post_content":"One key fundamental skill every crypto (and stock trader) needs to be fully conversant in is the art of reading chart patterns.If you are just getting started, this article will help you identify the most common chart patterns and for everyone else, it\u2019s a refresher :)The Head and Shoulders pattern is a classic reversal pattern signaling a trend shift from bullish to bearish or vice versa. It consists of three peaks: the first and third (the shoulders) are of similar height, while the middle peak (the head) is higher.The neckline, formed by connecting the troughs between the peaks, acts as a support or resistance line. When the price breaks through this neckline, it indicates a reversal is underway.Usage: Traders can capitalize on this pattern by short-selling at the breakout of a bearish Head and Shoulders pattern, or buying at the breakout of an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern.These patterns signal potential trend reversals, resembling a \u201CW\u201D (Double Bottom) or an \u201CM\u201D (Double Top). In a Double Top, prices rise to a resistance level twice, failing to break through, and then reverse downward. A Double Bottom occurs when prices hit a support level twice, failing to drop further, and then reverse upward.Usage: Traders can look for these patterns at market extremes. A breakout below the neckline of a Double Top signals a potential short position, while a breakout above the neckline of a Double Bottom signals a buying opportunity.Triangle patterns signal consolidation, often leading to continuation or reversal of a trend. They can take three forms:Usage: Traders can take positions in the direction of the breakout, or consider symmetrical triangles as a potential signal for trend continuation or reversal.These patterns typically indicate a continuation of the existing trend after a brief consolidation period.Usage: When prices break out from a Flag or Pennant, traders can enter positions in the direction of the primary trend.This bullish continuation pattern resembles a teacup, with a rounded \u201Ccup\u201D followed by a smaller \u201Chandle.\u201D The handle indicates a minor consolidation, often leading to a breakout in the same direction as the initial uptrend.Usage: Traders can look for a breakout above the handle\u2019s resistance level to enter a long position, anticipating a continuation of the previous uptrend.Learn how to identify each of the top 20 crypto chart patterns and download your own Chart Patterns PDF for quick reference.Knowing your crypto trading patterns is an invaluable tool for crypto traders, helping to provide insight into potential reversals or trend continuations.Mastering these five key patterns can significantly enhance your ability to navigate the crypto market\u2019s volatility.

It also holds the key to unlocking AI\u2019s full societal potential by enabling a truly open AI. In a world of AI solutions relying on performance battles of pre-trained AI models, ChatDKG stands for freedom of choice. A truly open AI approach allows anyone to define the trusted knowledge as the foundation for their AI solutions. It further extends the freedom of choice from trusted knowledge to multimodal support of a plethora of different AI models. For creators ready to take the plunge into the truly open AI future, an inception program is available to onboard them to ChatDKG.The currently prevalent approach in creating AI solutions is a siloed one \u2014 either in the shackles of a single AI model or a walled garden of external sources provided by a single organization. ChatDKG is breaking down those walls with an inclusive and open approach to creating AI solutions. Leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), it creates a neutral, inclusive knowledge foundation. As anyone publishes their knowledge to the DKG, their addition gets equipped with a timestamp, their identity, ascribed ownership, and verifiability proofs ensuring their knowledge is kept intact. Through a framework of decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), such knowledge is made available to any AI model as input to produce outputs that both have information provenance and respect data ownership. As trusted knowledge inputs become mission-critical for AI solutions, it ignites a knowledge economy where your knowledge network is your net worth.In addition to building trusted AI solutions with ChatDKG, participants in this new knowledge economy can get involved in growing the DKG in knowledge domains important to them. New types of autonomous knowledge networks can appear in any domain, narrow or wide, such as:Launching an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO) allows anyone to open up their mission to others who would like to join creating a knowledge foundation in that domain. Through an IPO, a paranet operator also ensures incentive rewards for participants that will add useful knowledge \u2014 knowledge miners. By accessing NeuroWeb network incentives for mining new knowledge, the paranet\u2019s trusted knowledge grows in a crowdsourced way.The ChatDKG\u2019s truly open AI does not only lower dependency on any single AI company, the freedom of choice of AI also ensures that any development in the field of AI models, prompt engineering, agent frameworks, or similar, is making your solution stronger. By putting the trusted knowledge foundation in the driving seat, the tech giants working on advancing AI systems are working in your favor as you are always able to use your knowledge network with the latest AI technologies.Those looking to build the next big thing with ChatDKG\u2019s trusted AI solution or launch an Initial Paranet Offering can submit their application for the ChatDKG inception program to receive additional support from the OriginTrail team.

I was a college student with no money for rent, food, bills, or anything really. I was waiting for the clock to turn midnight when the monthly student welfare would be paid to my bank account. When the day officially changed, I withdrew a couple hundred euros from an ATM. But it wasn\u2019t for bills or food. That money was earmarked for gassing up the car and driving to another city in the middle of the night to buy a used graphics card. Getting that card ASAP was my top priority in life.F\nast rewind a couple of weeks back, a friend of mine asked me if I had heard of something called Bitcoin. There was supposedly this Internet currency that had been rapidly gaining value, and anyone could mine it on their computer. Bitcoin was trading at about 15 euros a piece and it got me interested enough to read up on it and to figure out how mining works. To mine Bitcoin, you must harness your computer\u2019s processing power in the quest of solving extremely complex mathematical problems.Other miners in the network are doing the same and the Bitcoin protocol automatically rewards the first one to get to the correct answer with Bitcoins. Due to the difficulty of the calculations, every miner in the network is essentially trying to guess the answer. The more guesses your machine can do per second, the more likely you\u2019ll get it right. As more miners join the network, the problems get more difficult and earning coins slows down. Here\u2019s a more in-depth explanation of the process.After some rough calculations, my computer\u2019s hashing power would have yielded only 0.05 Bitcoins (0.75\u20AC) per day, which would not be worthwhile considering the cost of electricity. But there was another cryptocurrency, Litecoin that stole our attention. It was marketed as the \u201Csilver for Bitcoin\u2019s gold\u201D with faster transaction times, cheaper price and much faster mining due to it\u2019s lower popularity. There were Cryptocurrency exchanges online enabling you to trade Litecoins for Bitcoins, euros and dollars. Mining Litecoins was far more profitable and my computer was able to eke out almost two Litecoins (5\u20AC) in a day. I started thinking about ways to scale the operation up as much as possible!The main component used in mining was the computer graphics card. Motherboards, processors and RAM memory did not play an important role at all. As long as your hardware had a PCI-E slot for a graphics card and a power supply capable of running it at full power, you could efficiently mine cryptocurrencies. I used to buy and sell a lot of computer hardware, so I had extra motherboards and other components lying around, but only a few graphics cards.I whipped up an improvised secondary computer from spare parts and took it as a test to my friend\u2019s student dormitory where the electricity was \u201Cfree\u201D. Upon returning home, I rounded up all my computer parts and concluded that I could immediately run a total of five graphics cards spread across three computers at home. I just needed more cards, but there was an issue: I was completely broke, with overdue bills and the rent a few weeks late.I\nwas living on student welfare, totalling to about 500 euros per month. I also owned a car which was a luxury I really couldn\u2019t afford. At the end of the month I was always scrambling for money, late on my bills and hoping I could find a way out of it. Mining cryptocurrencies seemed like a real opportunity to finally \u201Cmake it\u201D. I firmly decided to spend all of my money not on the rent, nor on my overdue bills, but on more graphics cards from nearby online sellers. I now had a total of three cards mining Litecoins day in, day out, yielding about 12\u20AC of profit per day. The income already almost equaled my student welfare and I had no intention to stop expanding!Next up, my eyes were firmly set on a very specific date: March 4th, 2013. At midnight that day, I would receive my next student welfare payment. I had arranged the pickup for a new card for that night at 1:00 AM, just an hour after the money would land on my account. With my car running on fumes, I drove to a gas station, pulled the money out of an ATM and gassed up my trusty steed for the nightly drive. One more card, check!I spent the rest of the money next day to buy that fifth card with a cash deal in the city center. I tried to set aside some money for food and bills, but knew very well it wasn\u2019t going to get me even through the rest of the week. Having food to eat was a minuscule goal compared to maxing out my mining specs.Mining cryptocurrencies requires a lot of power, which equates to a lot of heat. Running my miners at full power caused extreme overheating and I didn\u2019t want to limit their speed. I did what any crypto-crazy miner would have done: I stripped out all the components from the miner cases and laid them on a table, bare, with all wires connected. I shoved the table against my kitchen ventilation window so the components could bask in the chilly air flowing inside.It looked like a true fire hazard with no cases, cables hanging everywhere and everything exposed. Instead of being able to press the power button of a computer case, I was now turning the computers on and resetting them by short-circuiting the motherboard pins with a screwdriver. But man did they run cool. Even at peak power, the card temperatures were far below the max, making them work for prolonged periods without crashing.By\nnow I was making a profit of about 20 euros per day. To expand, I would have to acquire even more base components and graphics cards. I sold all my valuable belongings and the mined coins as soon as they were coming in. With these and the help of buy now, pay later services, I was able to buy new top-end motherboards, second hand graphics cards to fill them up and the hefty power supplies required to run them. I was also able to rack up a pretty admirable debt in the process!I crammed yet another miner on the kitchen table, one next to the backyard door and a third one in the middle of my living room floor. No cases, propped up on cardboard boxes and operated via my trusty screwdriver. There were a total of 14 graphics cards mining coins, yielding about 55 euros of profits every single day. The cash flow was hard to argue against so I kept reinvesting everything on mining.I upgraded all my cards to the newest HD7900 series, which brought about a 50% boost in hashing power. I then populated even my bedroom with a mining rig, shooting up my profits to 80 euros per day! I had installed TeamViewer on my smartphone to fine tune my miners, even when I wasn\u2019t home. It felt like doing an on-call shift 24\/7 with multiple incidents occurring every single day, just to maximize my profits.Upgrading the cards had raised my farm\u2019s total power consumption to over 5 kilowatts. I had already distributed the miners to multiple areas in the apartment before to avoid blowing individual easy-to-replace fuses, but now it didn\u2019t matter where the miners were located anymore. Mining at full power and flipping on the stove or going to the sauna could have blown the main fuse of the apartment. I couldn\u2019t add a single card more.It\nwas July 2013 and the warmest month of the year in Finland. Ambient temperatures in my crib eventually crept up to a shocking 43 degrees celsius (109°F) during daytime. I didn\u2019t have to worry about going to the sauna anymore, I was living in one.The combined noise of all the cards\u2019 fans spinning at 100% was deafening and resembled the sound of operating a vacuum cleaner, times three. I asked my neighbors if they had heard any noise, just to be sure I wouldn\u2019t bother them. I myself was already numb to it.To optimize my miners, I started running them slower during the day and cranked em\u2019 up at night. I now kept switching between different cryptocurrencies, depending on which one was the most profitable to mine at any given moment. I may have woken up mining Litecoin and switched to Worldcoin or Feathercoin by lunch. It was the only way to maintain high profitability. I even set up an alarm system for any price changes and it sure kept me on the edge day and night.W\nhen the summer was nearing its end, the weather cooled down and the living conditions in my apartment became humane again. I was able to run my miners at acceptable speeds again, especially at night.The influx of new people entering the crypto mining game during the summer had dropped my daily mining profits to 30\u201340\u20AC per day. Meanwhile, my monthly electricity bill was hovering somewhere around a thousand euros. I was barely breaking even, but I kept on going, hoping to mine the right coin at the right time.Once winter officially arrived, I cranked up my miners to full speed. Even so, the ambient temperature in my apartment was only 10 degrees celsius (50°F) with all doors and windows open. I was dressed in full winter clothing to fight the cold and wore shoes because the floor was close to freezing temperature.I slept my nights on the living room couch with the aforementioned alarms blaring in case a miner had crashed or if I had to switch the mined coin. I was enjoying some of my greatest profits so far, gaining a good 100 euros per day on average, but I was also battling a new foe: snow.Yes, the spring, summer and autumn rains were a blessing when it came to temperatures, but snow is floaty. Snowflakes of all sizes would fly in through the doors and windows and land on my mining clusters. Snow and electricity don\u2019t mix well, so I devised various types of plastic and cardboard shelters, under which the miners could hide. But it wasn\u2019t enough.I woke up to a crashed miner alert. It had been snowing heavily and the snow had landed on the miner shelter next to the backyard door. The melted snow accumulated into enough water to drip through the cover and crash the miner. I dried up the components and used my screwdriver to short-circuit the start button pins; maybe it could still work?My action was immediately met by a negating flash of fire originating from the miner\u2019s 700 euro Radeon HD7990 dual GPU graphics card. It seemed as if someone had lit a big fat match inside of my crown jewel card, rendering it into trash metal. It cost me a big bunch of my profits, but times were good so I was able to recoup the losses in no time.E\nven though mining was extremely profitable, there were new FPGA and ASIC miners being developed in China, which would soon render graphics card mining futile. They were purpose-built pieces of hardware dedicated to mining cryptocurrencies, constantly driving down coin prices due to increased hash rates. I decided to hang tight as long as mining was even slightly profitable. There was still bread for the taking. And then something big happened: the release of Dogecoin.It was based on the wildly popular doge meme and had no real use cases or purpose. Being a huge fan of doge, I directed all my hashing power over to mine it, even though you couldn\u2019t even sell it anywhere yet. I was betting hard on the fact that a useless meme coin had immense potential to go viral and end up precious.I managed to mine millions and millions of Dogecoins before it was inevitably listed on an online exchange. I welcomed the opening price with open arms and proceeded to unload them all for a profit of almost 10,000 euros. It was the big fish I had been waiting for. This was followed by a few more months of gradually lowering mining profits, after which I decided to call it quits.I sold whatever equipment I still could, trying to recoup as much money as possible from my battle-worn miner army. I paid off all my debts, bills and rent, and the cold realization hit me: I had nothing left over to show for it. A year of full-time effort spent, living in inhumane conditions, becoming a nervous wreck. And nothing?Back then it did indeed feel like nothing. But now those experiences are cherished memories of boldly jumping into the unknown, self-discovery and never staying stagnant in the progress of technology.And hey! At least I got a nice story to tell about it.If you enjoyed the story, feel free to follow my account for more goodness in the coming weeks ❤️","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*X5Eo76vzSv-D68UA","author":"Lemon King","title":"I was a crazy crypto miner","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@thelemonking\/i-was-a-crazy-crypto-miner-dabebc276306","tags":[]},{"summary":"Thesis: The blockchain trilemma claims that a network can only implement and maintain two of the three properties at any given time\u2026","date":"Jul 13, 2023","post_content":"Thesis: The blockchain trilemma claims that a network can only implement and maintain two of the three properties at any given time: decentralization, security, and scalability. Building upon Nakamoto Consensus through BlockDAG theory¹ solves the blockchain trilemma. Solving the trilemma implies two things, a) Satoshi\u2019s peer-to-peer electronic cash system can be realized, and b) the most efficient layer-1 infrastructure can be created. Nakamoto Consensus alone cannot efficiently handle orphan blocks and is limited by a synchronous model, limiting its scalability and security. However, I will show how BlockDAG theory unlocks the full potential of Nakamoto Consensus.Within this essay, I will explain 1) what Nakamoto Consensus is, 2) why it has difficulty scaling, and 3) how implementing BlockDAG technology scales Nakamoto Consensus. I will explain 3) by providing a history of BlockDAG theory. This history will primarily cover the following protocols: GHOST, Inclusive protocols, SPECTRE, PHANTOM, GHOSTDAG, and DAGKNIGHT. Lastly, I will conclude how BlockDAG theory fulfills the three properties of the blockchain trilemma for Nakamoto Consensus.Nakamoto Consensus is a proof-of-work² consensus mechanism for the algorithmic ordering of a blockchain. Let\u2019s cover some jargon: proof-of-work, blockchain, and algorithmic ordering. Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor initially introduced proof-of-work in their work, Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail³, to combat Denial-of-service attacks; however, Nakamoto proof-of-work is primarily useful to combat Sybil attacks (an attack where one or a few gain disproportionate influence over decisions made in the network by obtaining an abundance of computing resources). To combat Sybil attacks, participants (otherwise known as miners) in a proof-of-work system solve challenging computational proofs to confirm blocks within the network (i.e., the confirmation of transactions) to receive a reward. Moreover, the nature of computation allows the network to quantify how much work a given proof contains.Blockchains are distributed systems that are run in a decentralized manner by nodes that do not need to trust one another. These systems must agree on a history or state of the world through a consensus. Moreover, these consensus orderings must satisfy certain properties to obtain \u201Ccorrectness.\u201D Nakamoto Consensus\u2074 adopts the correctness theory proposed by Leslie Lamport in Proving the Correctness of Multiprocess Programs\u2075. Lamport argued that both liveness and safety properties must apply to achieve correctness. Safety is the inability to revert a decision, while liveness is the inability to delay a decision.Blockchains work according to a total ordering on which a miner appends an entry (otherwise known as a block of transactions) atop a previous entry known as a reference (previous block hash). Within a total order, events have an exact order based on which event occurred first, creating a chain.Chains may also form natural forks where a second one-directional chain is built alongside the main chain. This happens when two miners create blocks at approximately the same time. When forks occur, the previous chain \u2014 known as an orphan chain \u2014 is no longer useful as the network decided to move forward with the new chain. Miners determine which blockchain to work on based on the Nakamoto consensus ordering algorithm, the longest chain rule. According to the longest chain rule (well, it actually works on a heaviest chain rule, but I am sweeping this detail under the rug for simplicity), miners must choose the chain that has computed the most-accumulated proof-of-work by analyzing the difficulties of each block in that specific blockchain (i.e., a more computational effort has been expended to verify and confirm blocks within the network on one chain than another). For simplicity\u2019s sake, it\u2019s assumed that the longest chain by height correlates to the longest chain by aggregate work\/hashes computed.It\u2019s important to note that once a fork is resolved, transactions on the losing blockchain are invalidated unless they were simultaneously included in the winning blockchain.\u2076 This wastes electricity and computational power and slows down the network.The longest chain rule also adheres to a block delay, L, whereby L continuously updates to keep block arrivals (otherwise known as the block creation or confirmation time)\u2077 in ~10 minutes. The combination of L and proof-of-works computational power fulfills liveness and safety, as network users can assume with high probability that it is infeasible to reverse transactions after some number of blocks. Thus, Bitcoin functions according to a synchronous model, which assumes an agreed global upper bound on the network delay.The longest-chain rule, however, is vulnerable to history rewrites if an attacker mines a chain longer than the honest chain. A history rewrite (otherwise known as a reorganization or reorg) can be used for fraud \u2014 for example, let\u2019s say that a participant, person A, purchases a rare guitar from another participant, person B, for 2 BTC. Person A sees the transaction is included in block D and, thus, hands over the guitar. However, person B decides to mine two consecutive blocks, E and F, on top of block C, using the same funds they used to buy the guitar to pay themselves. All miners will abandon block D and start extending block F due to the longest chain rule, and person A is left without 2 BTC and their guitar. This is called a double-spend attack.Person A can protect themselves from such an attack by waiting for a few blocks after block D before they give person B the guitar, reducing the chance that person B will succeed in building a competing chain. Typically, a transaction is considered confirmed once six blocks have passed (resulting in a confirmation time of 60 minutes). This default time is based on the assumption, α, that an attacker has 10% of the network\u2019s total hash rate and a risk, ε, of <0.1% a node is willing to absorb\u2078. However, if person B has 51% of the mining power, they can implement a reorg regardless of how long person A waits. This is because person B\u2019s block creation rate is higher than the other miners\u2019 creation rates combined. Thus, proof-of-work systems assume that at least 50% of the honest mining power must belong to honest participants. More specifically, a 49% attack is prevented by math, and a 51% attack is prevented by money. The probability of a 49% attack to succeed decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations. A 51% attack has a chance to win if it can run long enough; however, the cost of such an attack is huge.In their paper, Secure High-Rate Transaction Processing in Bitcoin\u2079, Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar proved how increasing Bitcoin\u2019s throughput \u2014 either by increasing the block creation rate λ, or the block size, b \u2014 could reduce the 51% attack threshold to implement a reorg.Increasing the block size. Sompolinsky and Zohar studied the work of Christian Decker and Roger Wattenhofer in Information Propagation in the Bitcoin Network¹\u2070, taking a large sample of network nodes from height 180,000 to 190,000 of the public ledger. As shown below, it was discovered a linear relationship between block size and propagation time; the larger the block size, the longer the propagation time. The linear increase occurs because of the verification time \u2014 i.e., if a block is five times larger, it takes a node five times longer to verify the block before rebroadcasting it.For example, let\u2019s say the Bitcoin community wants to scale the network to Visa levels to process 2,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin\u2019s current throughput is about 7 transactions per second due its current block size of 2 MBs. Thus, Visa levels would require a block size 285 times larger, equalling 570 MBs. With a network delay of 285 seconds (assuming the network delay is linear) and a block creation rate of one block every 600 seconds (10 minutes), there is a 285\/600=0.475 chance that another block will be created \u2014 meaning almost 50% of the blocks will belong to forks. This allows an attacker to maintain a reorg attack simply by creating blocks faster than the main chain.Increasing the block creation rate. Bitcoin\u2019s network delay is about 1 second, and as we know, a new block is created on average every 600 seconds (10 minutes). Because the average block\u2019s creation time is 600 times bigger than the network delay, it\u2019s improbable that a block will be mined while another block is still propagated.¹¹ However, the likelihood increases once the block creation rate increases. If the block creation rate increases, more blocks will be created while the most recent block in the main chain is propagated. This will cause more forks as the likelihood of every miner not being up to date will also increase. Similarly, as in the case of increasing block sizes, attackers can execute reorg attacks by creating blocks faster than the main chain with less than 51% hash power, as shown in the illustration below.When an attacker sees a fork trying to be resolved (causing a temporary slowdown of the main chain), the attacker will use that time to outrun the main chain to create a longer chain (known as selfish mining)¹². The longer chain will start as a secret chain until it\u2019s long enough to be announced and adopted by the other miners. Moreover, the attacker can do this with less than 51% of the hash power. Why? Because if half of the blocks are forked, only two-thirds of them will go into the main chain \u2014 meaning an attacker only needs 50%×(2\/3)=33% of the hashing power to sustain an attack. Moreover, electricity and computational costs are more significantly wasted, increasing the cost for new miners to enter the network and, thus, causing further centralization.GHOST (The Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree)¹³ paved the way for BlockDAGs, as it resolved forking conflicts by using forks for the protocol\u2019s advantage \u2014 thereby increasing throughput and security, as attackers can no longer outpace the network. The topology of Nakamoto Consensus changes with GHOST as aggregate work is viewed with a 2-dimensional view instead of a 1-dimensional view via tree graphs.¹\u2074Instead of following the longest rule at each fork, GHOST proposes to follow the heaviest subtree. In other words, the protocol will follow the path of a subtree with the combined hardest proof-of-work or difficulty.Let\u2019s take a look at the following illustration above. As we can see, multiple forks have been generated alongside the main chain (either by increasing the block creation rate or size); by the second layer, there is a three-pronged fork, and another by the 3rd layer. The attacker\u2019s chain (6 blocks) is longer than the main chain of the network ending in 5B and would assume the place of the main chain under the longest-chain rule. However, under GHOST, the main chain selected is the one with the most combined work.Thus, GHOST considers all blocks within the network and incorporates forked blocks within the main chain; this saves electricity and computational power and also increases throughput as the block creation rate or size can increase without harming security. Sompolinsky and Zohar provided data to demonstrate this, by simulating the network with 1,000 nodes according to several uniform parameters. As the block creation rate increases, security remains constant for blockchains.Ethereum, as a proof-of-work blockchain, was able to increase its throughput higher than Bitcoin (roughly 20 transactions-per-second compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 7 transactions-per-second) and decrease wastage by implementing a variant of GHOST, as an inclusive protocol, from the work, Inclusive Block Chain Protocols, by Yoad Lewenberg, Yonatan Sompolinsky, and Aviv Zohar.¹\u2075In an Inclusive protocol, the following properties are obtained: (1) new blocks reference multiple predecessors; (2) non-conflicting transactions within blocks outside of the main chain are included in the ledger; and (3) miners of blocks outside the main chain receive a portion of the block reward. Within Ethereum, however, transactions in referenced forked blocks are not included in the ledger, and miners of these transactions do not receive transaction fees. Only referenced orphan block (otherwise called Ommer blocks) miners receive a portion of the block reward.¹\u2076However, while GHOST made headway to increase the scalability and security on top of Nakamoto-generalized protocols, it still had its flaws. First, improved security comes at the expense of slightly slower time resolving forks; for example, GHOST couldn\u2019t scale to, say, 1 second blocks. Or it can be said that the more \u201Cinclusive\u201D you are (in the sense of how distant a cousin has to be from the main chain to be included), the worse your confirmation times become. Secondly, miners who are better connected to the network could gain rewards greater than their fair share. Lastly, the ability to form secret chains still remains possible with selfish mining.GHOST introduced graph theory with subtrees¹\u2077 as a generalized Nakamoto Consensus mechanism. SPECTRE¹\u2078 took the idea further by implementing a full BlockDAG to build upon Nakamoto generalization. In other words, in GHOST, trees were leveraged to solve Nakamoto\u2019s orphan rate problem, and SPECTRE leverages a BlockDAG to solve the orphan rate problem. Moreover, SPECTRE provides greater scalability than GHOST or basic Nakamoto Consensus by implementing weak liveness.What is a BlockDAG? DAG stands for direct acrylic graph; meaning (1) it is a data structure moving in one direction; (2) the data structure is non-cyclical, and therefore cannot return to a previous state from the current state; and (3) it is structured as a graph, G=(V, E), with vertices and edges. In typical DAG structures, transactions are documented as vertices without the implementation of blocks, and edges provide direction for each vertex. However, vertices within BlockDAGs are blocks, which reference multiple predecessor blocks (or parent blocks) instead of a single predecessor. In other words, to extend the ledger within a BlockDAG, blocks reference all tips of the graph (that their miners observe locally) instead of referencing the tip of the single longest chain. A DAG built of blocks decreases the forking dilemma of Nakamoto Consensus, as the main chain can now point to forked blocks; more so, work is no longer discarded when facing an attacker.The topology of a BlockDAG is such that if U and V are connected by the edge e=(U →V), U comes before V in the ordering, O. In other words, if a path exists from block V to block U in the DAG, block U was created before block V and should precede V in the global order. However, a defined ordering is needed when blocks are created in parallel \u2014 i.e., a set of blocks without a path connecting them, as in the case of forks. This is where SPECTRE comes in. SPECTRE is an ordering algorithm that eliminates transactions in conflict with previous ones.SPECTRE\u2019s ordering is conducted through a pairwise voting mechanism to determine how likely transactions will be reversed. For each pair of blocks U, V, a vote must determine whether U defeats V or V defeats U, denoted by U>V or V>U. Moreover, within a set of transactions, a transaction embedded in U is accepted if block U defeats all blocks containing conflicting transactions¹\u2079. This is quite abstract; let\u2019s break it down. First, \u201Cdefeat,\u201D denoted as U>V, does not mean one block is greater than the other. Rather it means one comes before the other, i.e., U comes before V. Furthermore, defeating one block with another only matters if conflicting transactions are present between the two; otherwise, non-conflicting transactions will always be accepted.Voting is conducted by the blocks themselves (the determiners). There are three ways a block, Z, may conduct a vote: (1) if block V has a path back to U, then Z will vote U>V; (2) if there is no path between block V and U, Z will vote for the block within its local ordering it can see \u2014 so if Z sees U but not V, then U>V; (3) if there is no path between V and U and Z sees both U and V, then it\u2019ll vote according to a recursive computation based on how other past blocks have voted. For example, Block 12 (in the image below²\u2070) votes for an ordering that does not contain blocks 10,11, and 12 because more blocks voted for X>Y in 12\u2019s past than 9\u201310\u201311\u2019s voted for Y>X. This is a generalization of the longest chain rule, as the path chosen is the path with the most votes.SPECTRE\u2019s Weak Liveness. Unlike Bitcoin and other Nakamoto generalizations covered, SPECTRE is agnostic to the network\u2019s global network delay, D. An upper bound of D is assumed; however, the bound is assumed locally by each node, which each node can adjust as network conditions change. This allows SPECTRE to achieve fast confirmation times during healthy periods and maintain responsiveness during network conflicts. In this positive sense, this is also known as a parameterless model; however, \u201Cself-scaling\u201D is better term. Moreover, each node is responsible for its choice in D, as an overly inaccurate choice can harm them. For example, if a node overestimates D, it cannot recognize an irreversible transaction, and if a node underestimates D, it will accept transactions prematurely.Liveliness is therefore weakened; however, it is only weakened when conflicting transactions occur. In other words, as long as there are no conflicting blocks, ordering doesn\u2019t matter. The \u201Cvoting\u201D mechanism kicks in only if a conflict is detected. For example, if a published transaction with zero published conflicts is guaranteed irreversibility very quickly. However, suppose two or more conflicting transactions are published simultaneously or soon after one another. In that case, their irreversibility will be decided on within a longer finite time frame. This allows a significant increase in throughput.Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that SPECTRE was designed solely for payment use cases, whereby the owner of the funds functions as the sole entity to produce and sign transactions (including conflicting ones). SPECTRE\u2019s pairwise ordering is not transitive²¹ and, thus, does not provide a linear ordering, as blocks can switch places long after being confirmed (without invalidating transactions). This does not work for smart contracts as strict ordering among transactions is required; otherwise, having out-of-order computations can cause some to fail, and users could feed the contracts with conflicting inputs. With this in mind, GHOSTDAG was designed to support smart contacts by implementing a converging linear ordering.GHOSTDAG implements a total ordering, allowing the ability to develop smart contracts atop the protocol as computation will occur in exactly the way the designer intended. The trade-off is that GhostDAG implements an upper bound on the network latency time, and is thus, non-responsive to network latency. GHOSTDAG is built upon the foundations of PHANTOM in PHANTOM GHOSTDAG: A Scalable Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus by Yonatan Sompolinsky, Shai Wyborski, and Aviv Zohar.²²PHANTOM. PHANTOM is a blockDAG ordering algorithm constructed theoretically without real-world efficiency in mind. PHANTOM\u2019s goal is to order honest blocks in a well-connected manner. Since honest nodes aren\u2019t withholding blocks and communicating with one another, their computational work should be well connected. On the other hand, an attacker developing a secret side chain would be disconnected from the main chain. In a typical BlockDAG, each block references all blocks known to its miner when it was created, but how do we know which blocks are well-connected and which aren\u2019t?From a single block\u2019s perspective, B, a BlockDAG is divided into three subsets: the block\u2019s past (the set of blocks reachable from B), future (the set of all blocks from which B is reachable (equivalently the set of all blocks which have B in their past), and the block\u2019s anticone. Anticones are blocks that are neither a block\u2019s past nor future. The well-connected set is the biggest sub-DAG (otherwise known as a K-cluster) where no block has an anticone greater than K. In other words, the PHANTOM optimization rule always returns a max K-connected cluster, such that a tie-breaking rule is implemented if there are several maximal K-clusters.K represents the maximum antigone size within a K-cluster, and K must be greater than 2Dλ, whereby D equals the network delay and λ equals the block creation rate. K is hard coded in PHANTOM (and GHOSTDAG) and is, thus, selected in a predetermined manner. Therefore, deciding the value of K is very important. If the value of K is too large, too many forks will occur, reducing the network\u2019s security; if the value of K is too small, it will limit the network\u2019s performance, lowering the throughput.For example, if we look at the well-connected blocks highlighted in blue in the diagram above (with K=3), we can now identify that each blue block has at most 3 blue blocks in its anticone. Thus, at most, 4 blocks are assumed to be created within each unit of delay, and the anticone size should not exceed 3. Therefore, blocks outside the cluster, E, H, and K (colored red), belong to the attacker. For instance, block E has 6 blue blocks in its anticone (B, C, D, F, G, and I), as these blocks didn\u2019t reference E (as E was likely withheld from its miners). Similarly, block K has 6 blue blocks in its anticone (B, C, G, F, I, and J).However, finding a maximal K-cluster is NP-hard, meaning that the likelihood of proving it will result in the breakdown of what we know about computer science. Moreover, PHANTOM does not work in an incremental manner; whenever the DAG updates, the entire computation must be restarted \u2014 requiring the storage of the entire DAG structure.GHOSTDAG and its Linear Ordering. GHOSTDAG functions as a greedy variant of PHANTOM, allowing a practical approach for adoption. A greedy variant is an algorithm that solves a problem by making the locally optimal choice at each process stage. Thus, instead of finding a maximal K-connected cluster, GHOSTDAG approximates K incrementally and recursively. It does this by numbering each block with a blue score, indicating how many blocks in its past are in the K-cluster.²³For example, if we look at Figure 3 from the PHANTOM GHOSTDAG paper, we can see how block M is recursively selected within a given K-cluster, G, with K=3. The circled number is the score of blue blocks in the DAG\u2019s past. The GHOSTDAG algorithm greedily selects a chain starting from the highest scoring tip, M, and then K, as K is the highest scoring tip in M\u2019s past (and then H, and D \u2014 D is arbitrarily selected to break the tie between C, D, and E \u2014 and lastly, the genesis). This chain is used to construct the blue block set of the DAG.In step 1, while visiting D, the genesis block is added to the blue set since it is the only block in D\u2019s past. In step 2, H is visited, and the blue blocks in its past \u2014 C, D, and E \u2014 are added. In step 3, K is visited with the blocks of its past \u2014 H and I \u2014 added. However, block B is not added to the overall blue set because it has an anticone of 4. In step 4, M is visited with K added to the blue set. F was not added due to its large anticone. In the last step, 5, a hypothetical block, V, is visited, (whose past equals the DAG) with M added to the blue set. Block L and J are left out as L has a large anticone and because adding J would increase the anticone of L even more.However, what happens when an attacker allows their blocks to point to honest blocks to increase their blue score? GHOSTDAG implements a mechanism to stop this, known as the freeloading bound. The bound mechanism ensures that a miner can only freeload older blocks by a specific constant (namely 3k+1 blocks). Thus, changing the ordering of arbitrarily old blocks will run into a race where freeloading does not provide the attacker any advantage over honest nodes who consistently point to other honest blocks.GHOSTDAG affords nearly immediate confirmation times (in the order of seconds). For example, Kaspa, built according to GHOSTDAG, achieves 10 blocks per second, or roughly 3,000 transactions per second.²\u2074However, It\u2019s important to note that while a maximum K-cluster is not calculated in GHOSTDAG, parameter D is still chosen in advance \u2014 thereby assuming an a priori bound on the worst-case latency.²\u2075 Thus, the BlockDAG under GHOSTDAG functions synchronously, meaning that there exists some known finite time bound Δ, whereby with any message sent, an adversary can delay its delivery by at most Δ. Moreover, setting an upper delay bound leads to a margin of error to maintain security, meaning two things:(A) If latency improves below D, the confirmation time becomes suboptimal.(B) If latency degrades above D, security will degrade with it.For example, GHOSTDAG\u2019s upper delay bound is set to 10 seconds, thus, given (A) and (B), if latency increases to 12 seconds for a period, a 45% attacker could take over the network; if latency increases to 60 seconds, a 25% attacker could take over the network. It\u2019s important to note that this holds for all PoW chains.DAGKNIGHT is a BlockDAG ordering algorithm written by Michael Sutton and Yonatan Sompolinsky in their work, The DAG KNIGHT Protocol: A Parameterless Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus.²\u2076 DAGKNIGHT solves GHOSTDAG\u2019s issues by designing a version of GHOSTDAG (maintaining its strong liveness) in a parameterless way by monitoring network conditions to determine the best current K and D.²\u2077 In other words, instead of guaranteeing a 10-second confirmation delay, the confirmation time adapts automatically according to miner network conditions and optimizations in the block validation algorithm.How does DAGKNIGHT do this? First off, it\u2019s important to note that DAGKNIGHT is a greedy iteration of PHANTOM-X,²\u2078 a term only known within the DAGKNIGHT research circle (i.e., the term doesn\u2019t exist within the DAGKNIGHT paper). Instead of choosing K in advance, PHANTOM-X looks for the smallest K such that the largest K-cluster covers more than half of the blocks while maintaining 50% fault tolerance.For example, as shown in the image below,²\u2079 as an attackers fraction (on the right side of [a],[b], and [c]) grows from 𝛼 = 0.05 in (a) to 𝛼 = 0.45 in (c), the PHANTOM-X algorithm finds a K-cluster of sufficient width to cover at least 50% of the DAG, thereby outweighing the minority attacker.Moreover, as shown in the second image below,³\u2070 confirmation times change according to various network conditions. For example, as latency begins at 2 seconds per block in (a) and decreases to 0.1 seconds in (c), K decreases from 4 in (a) to 0 in (c). The confirmation time decreases from 12 seconds in (a) to 1.2 seconds in (c)while covering 50% of the DAG \u2014 demonstrating that confirmation times of PHANTOM-X change according to various network conditions while maintaining a security threshold of 50%.In other words, PHANTOM finds a maximal k-cluster, which is NP impossible; so, a greedy variant was created, GHOTSDAG. Similarly, the PHANTOM-X solves the harder problem of a minimal maximal k-cluster (the minimal k such that the maximal k-cluster is at least half of the DAG). Therefore, DAGKNIGHT was created to follow a greedy variant of PHANTOM-X to recursively find a K-cluster of sufficient width to cover at least 50% of the DAG. The greediness (or, more accurately, \u201Cincrementality\u201D) is *required* for establishing security: without it, the protocol cannot promise that the maximal K-cluster computed at some times doesn\u2019t exclude blocks in earlier K-clusters.DAGKNIGHT\u2019s incrementality can resist 50% attacks without relying on network latency assumptions. Therefore, a margin of error is not required because if network conditions degrade, confirmation times will automatically increase to compensate. Moreover, this allows DAGKNIGHT to adjust block confirmation times according to real-time network conditions. For example, when the network\u2019s adversarial latency is low, DAGKNIGHT\u2019s orderings converge immediately, allowing clients to confirm transactions within a few Round Trip Times. On the other hand, when the network is slow and clogged, the orderings converge more slowly, and thus, allow the transaction confirmations to take longer.It\u2019s important to note that the parameterlessness property of DAGKNIGHT also holds for SPECTER; however, it comes at the cost of only having weak liveness (prohibiting the implementation of smart contracts). DAGKNIGHT, on the other hand, achieves BOTH parameterlessness AND strong liveness \u2014 and is the first protocol to do so.Some may argue that Nakamoto Consensus, namely the Bitcoin protocol, doesn\u2019t need to scale, as the cryptocurrency is meant to be held as a store of value. This argument is not ridiculous, as it serves as an alternative to gold and silver. Nonetheless, if we want to fulfill Satoshi\u2019s vision of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, it must scale, as nobody will want to wait once 6 blocks have passed (60 minutes) to purchase something.³¹ Moreover, it has been shown that original Nakamoto Consensus cannot scale due to its synchronous nature and its conflicts arising from forks. However, it has been shown that generalized Nakamoto Consensus can- i.e., the BlockDAG protocols summarized above, namely GHOST, SPECTRE, GHOSTDAG, and DAGKNIGHT.One may ask, why keep proof-of-work and mining to (a) fulfill Satoshi\u2019s payment vision and (b) develop a layer 1 blockchain? Or more importantly, why solve the blockchain trilemma using generalized Nakamoto Consensus (as solving the blockchain trilemma achieves both [a] and [b])? The answer is that generalized Nakamoto Consensus achieves high levels of decentralization and security, especially compared to proof-of-stake and other Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocols. What original Nakamoto Consensus lacked was scalability. It\u2019s already been shown that generalized Nakamoto Consensus is scalable. Therefore, if we can demonstrate that generalized Nakamoto Consensus, namely BlockDAG theory, is decentralized and secure, we can solve the blockchain trilemma.Decentralization. Nakamoto Consensus is decentralized because miners within proof-of-work must continuously invest in order to maintain their relative power. This supports (1) economic decentralization and (2) a more permissionless system. Why is this the case? Let\u2019s explain (1) and (2) by comparing proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. In proof-of-stake, staked participants do not need to continually invest in order to secure the network. Instead, already powerful nodes can gain more power since staked currency produces more currency from network rewards \u2014 empowering large stakeholders. This means there can be only one type of node on the network \u2014 a rich one. In contrast, miners within proof-of-work must update their hardware, maintain stable electrical costs, and ensure external factors do not interfere with production (i.e., storage, housing, and so on). For (2), anyone can provide proof-of-work and try to produce a block within the main chain. However, in proof-of-stake, users must either be a rich node or delegate their stake to the rich nodes, increasing the barrier of entry to participate in the network\u2019s security and operations.But what about other DAGS? Why focus on BlockDAG innovations? Many DAGS, such as IOTA, Byteball, and Nano, are blockless DAGs. Blockless is a fancy term for blocks with one transaction. Blocks with one transaction are not scalable. It is a \u201Cfeature\u201D which disables economies of scale, as users can no longer delegate their transactions to service providers to aggregate transactions. DAGs of this nature also rely on centralized authorities such as Coordinators double-checking all transactions, and thus, create a single point of failure.Moreover, many blockchains utilize DAGs to process their transactions but not their ledgers (i.e., they are not a true DAG-based ledger). Blockchains within this camp include Fantom and Aleph Zero. On the other hand, current projects utilizing a DAG ledger operate according to proof-of-stake; thus, they are less secure, with a security threshold of 33% compared to 50%. These projects include Avalanche X-Chain and SUI.³²Security. Nakamoto Consensus is secure as it has a security threshold of 50%, meaning that an attacker must have at least 51% of the network\u2019s hash power to overcome the network. A security threshold of 50% is the highest security threshold modern-day cryptography can achieve, compared to Byzantine Fault Tolerant and proof-of-stake protocols, which are only resilient to an attacker achieving 33% of the network\u2019s economic power. Moreover, BlockDAG Nakamoto generalizations significantly increase original Nakamoto security by solving conflicts arising from forks and hardwired upper bounds on network delays. Moreover, Nakamoto Consensus\u2019 security exists within its own protocol and outside global forces. This is because proof-of-work creates harder, sounder money, as its value is anchored to markets beyond itself and an objective, physical grounding, such as electricity, computing hardware, and warehouses situated across the globe.Some criticize proof-of-work\u2019s reliance on electricity as a possible security concern (not to mention a burden to the environment). This is a justified concern, but current research in Optical-Proof-of-Work (otherwise called oPoW) alleviates this concern.³³ oPoW is a paradigm shift to lower operational costs (such as electricity), known as OpEx, to allocate more funds to capital expenses, known as CapEx. The desire to decrease operational costs reduces proof-of-work\u2019s environmental impact and provides better network security. This is because an OpEx-heavy paradigm equates to miners burning the security budget by using it. Moreover, only countries with lower OpEx costs, such as electricity costs, can support proof-of-work infrastructure, thus severely increasing the barrier to entry.Being CapEx-heavy, on the other hand, means the miner\u2019s investment protects the system by locking them into the system without burning their investment with every new block mined. Moreover, a larger cache of specialized security hardware is maintained, increasing the barrier to attack. oPow, therefore, utilizes Optical ASICS, which uses very little energy to run. Optical technology has been widely adopted for AI servers and is compatible with the hashing algorithm, the kHeavyHash, utilized by GHOSTDAG and DAGKNIGHT.It\u2019s important to note that a CapEx paradigm does not mean it\u2019s better to have higher CapEx costs; instead, miners can focus less on operational costs. For example, the cost of entering oPoW hardware manufacturing could be much lower³\u2074 than ASICs since old Silicon Photonics, such as CMOS nodes (~90 or 220 nm vs. ~7 nm for transistors), are sufficient to create Optical ASIC mining hardware.Some may argue that ASIC mining increases centralization due to their hash power dominance over GPUs and CPUs. However, fewer entities dominating the mining industry is not, in-and-of-itself, centralization, \u2014 as the entities cannot impose non-linear \u201Crich-get-richer effects.\u201D This was proven in Theorem 4 for original Nakamoto Consensus in the work Bitcoin Mining Pools: A Cooperative Game Theoretic Analysis.³\u2075Scalability. Nakamoto Consensus\u2019s full potential is unlocked when it is discovered how to build it without scalability limitations, as scalability solutions simultaneously increase security. It started with GHOST utilizing subtrees to develop the heaviest chain rule to handle forking conflicts arising from the longest chain rule. However, GHOST\u2019s security came at the expense of disallowing higher speeds; for example, GHOST cannot scale to 1-second blocks. Moreover, GHOST was still susceptible to secret chain attacks. GHOST\u2019s speed was increased with SPECTRE utilizing BlockDAG technology and a partially synchronous model, achieving 10 blocks per second. SPECTRE is also capable of outrunning secret chain attacks.Nonetheless, SPECTRE doesn\u2019t implement linear ordering, a property necessary for building smart contracts. GHOSTDAG resolved this issue by implementing linear ordering while maintaining strong liveness; however, linear ordering came at the expense of implementing an upper bound on the network latency time. Thus, GHOSTDAG is non-responsive to network latency, causing security vulnerabilities. DAGKNIGHT solved GHOSTDAG\u2019s security issues by designing a parameterless version of GHOSTDAG \u2014 merging useful properties from SPECTRE and GHOSTDAG into one protocol. Nonetheless, GHOSTDAG can reach throughput levels equivalent to Visa with 3,000 transactions per second, and with DAGKNIGHT, it can do so securely.Conclusion. BlockDAG theory, as a generalization of Nakamoto Consensus, therefore, achieves high scalability. Even more so, scalability is achieved while increasing the security of original Nakamoto Consensus and maintaining its decentralization. Thus, we can say the blockchain trilemma is solved.[1] More specifically, BlockDAG theory as a generalization of Nakamoto Consensus. The goal of generalization is to preserve the key aspects of Nakamoto Consensus while also implementing new structures to increase scalability, security, or decentralization. The BlockDAG theories covered in this essay are all generalizations of Nakamoto Consensus. Moreover, it\u2019s important to note that I will cover how the blockchain trilemma is theoretically solved at the consensus level.[2] Original Proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms were based on Nakamoto Consensus; however, Nakamoto PoS, in its naive form, suffers from the \u201Cnothing at stake\u201D problem and long-range attacks. Due to this issue, PoS systems adopted Byzantine Fault Tolerant-style consensus, known as state-machine-replication-based PoS. For this essay, I cover PoW-style Nakamoto Consensus only.[3] Dwork, Cynthia, and Moni Naor.

FLP Impossibility was proposed by Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson, who described in their 1985 paper, Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process, that liveness and safety cannot be satisfied in asynchronous distributed systems. The CAP theorem by Eric Brewer extended the work of FLP Impossibility.[6] The invalidated transactions are re-included into a pool for future block inclusion of the correct blockchain. The excluded transactions can be automatically retransmitted and eventually be automatically included in the winning chain. For this reason, Bitcoin implemented a \u201Ccoinbase cooldown,\u201D whereby miners must wait for 100 blocks before they can spend block rewards \u2014 thus, block rewards can *not* be retransmitted, and they become invalid in a reorg.[7] In other words, when transactions within a block are considered to be \u2018processed.\u2019Moreover, the entire blockchain scalability problem can be reduced to the statement that \u201CFor a blockchain to be secure it must hold that D<<L\u201D (<< means \u201Cmuch smaller\u201D), whereby D = the network delay and L = the block delay.[8] Rosenfeld, Meni.

Liveness is satisfied via proof-of-work, and safety is fulfilled as the network has a bounded upper delay, denoted by the sum of all individual node delays.[15] Buterin, Vitalik. Ethereum Whitepaper, 2013, ethereum.org\/en\/whitepaper\/.Another idea that GHOST and the Inclusive protocol framework inspired was FruitChains: A Fair Blockchain, written by Rafael Pass and Elaine Shi. These two people also influenced the work of DAGKNIGHT with their work on synchronous, partially synchronous, and asynchronous models, such as in Rethinking Large-Scale Consensus and PaLa: A Simple Partially Synchronous Blockchain.[16] Later, as Ethereum moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, a new consensus mechanism was utilized, known as Gasper, a combination of Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper-FFG) and the LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm. I will not explain how Gasper works as it isn\u2019t relevant to the essay.[17] It\u2019s important to note that a Tree is a restricted form of a graph and fits within the category of a DAG, utilizing the parent\/child relationship. However, a child within a tree can only have one parent. A DAG, on the other hand, can have multiple parents (otherwise known as predecessors).[18] Sompolinsky, Yonatan, et al.

PHANTOM GHOSTDAG A Scalable Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus, 10 Nov. 2021, eprint.iacr.org\/2018\/104.pdf[23] Given a particular block, its selected parent is the parent with the highest blue score. The entire k-cluster is not calculated when a new block is created. Instead, most of the k-cluster is inherited from the block\u2019s parent. Thus, a block tracks those in its blue past but not in its parent\u2019s blue past. In this sense, GHOSTDAG creates a generalization of Nakamoto Consensus since by choosing K=0, the blue score is the length of the longest chain, and the selected chain is the original Nakamoto chain.[24] \u201CCryptocurrency Milestone: Kaspa Hits Record 10 Blocks Per Second on Testnet, Redefines Proof-of-Work Speed Standards .\u201D Digital Journal, 27 June 2023, www.digitaljournal.com\/pr\/news\/binary news-network\/cryptocurrency-milestone-kaspa-hits-record-10-blocks-p er-second-on-testnet-redefines-proof-of-work-speed-standards.[25] In other words, implementing a hardwired bound on network latency.Parameter K can be derived from D and L \u2014 and another parameter, delta, indicating how secure you want to be. In reality, GHOSTDAG is secure against 50%-delta attacks where delta is as small as you want, but K still grows (quadratically, not exponentially like in GHOST) with delta.[26] Sutton, Michael, and Yonatan Sompolinsky. The DAG KNIGHT Protocol: A Parameterless Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus, 23 Feb. 2023, eprint.iacr.org\/2022\/1494.pdf[27] Until DAGKNIGHT, only partially synchronous or asynchronous models were possible under a security threshold of 33% important, as shown by Rafael Pass and Elaine Shi. DAGKNIGHT is the first permissionless parameterless consensus protocol that is secure against attackers with less than 50% of the computational power in the network.[28] Shai (Deshe) Wyborski confirmed the term PHANTOM-X via private correspondence.[29] Taken from the DAGKNIGHT White Paper as recorded through simulations by the authors.[30] A simulation of a network mining 𝜆 = 3.75 blocks per second and a secret attacker with 𝛼 = 0.2, the required risk parameter was set to 𝜖 = 0.05.[31] However, if Bitcoin remains a store of value, then a different generalized Nakamoto Consensus cryptocurrency must prevail as a cryptocurrency intended to be used by the masses.[32] Other BlockDAG variants include Meshcash \u2014 in Tortoise and Hares Consensus: the Meshcash Framework for Incentive-Compatible, Scalable Cryptocurrencies by Iddo Bentov, Pavel Hub\u2019aˇcek, Tal Moran, and Asaf Nadler \u2014 and OHIE in OHIE: Blockchain Scaling Made Simple by Haifeng Yu, Ivica Nikolic, Ruomu Hou, and Prateek Saxena. Meshcash later adopted a new consensus mechanism, Spacemesh, which utilized proof-of-space instead of proof-of-work.

Not all of us, of course, but there were certain seedy elements of the beta testing crowd that, rather than follow the virtue of Honesty, chose to hoard their knowledge of exploits rather than report them to the development team.Once UO\u2019s beta ended and the game launched, well, suddenly the economy was hit by a wave of item duping.What was this \u201Ccarefully guarded\u201D exploit?Abusing areaserv boundaries.I still remember the first time I saw it for myself.It was 1997 and I was running around north of the orc encampment near the town of Cove when I saw some randos doing the weirdest thing ever: they were running back and forth over this annoyingly laggy patch of the game map while dropping little chests on the ground.Now, I knew this particular area as being\u2026 the worst.You see, there was this truly annoying part of the map on that dirt path between the mountains and the orc fortress that was pretty unresponsive and jerky when you walked over it.In fact, if you *ran* across it you might get \u201Crubberbanded\u201D \u2014 finding yourself losing a few seconds of gameplay time as you bounced back to a previous position before the server \u201Ccaught up.\u201D(Remind me to tell you all about UO\u2019s server\/client interpolation and tick-rate someday!)This was especially bad if a monster, like an inconveniently placed Orc Captain directly south of you, was chasing you and whacked you to death during your pathetically laggy attempt to flee.Imagine my surprise when these two players started excitedly yelling to each other in text (which floated over their heads) that \u201Cit worked! omgz!\u201DYup, they had managed to, as they excitedly bragged, figure out a trick to drop a chest on one side of the \u201Claggy patch\u201D while trying to pick-it-up\/hand-it-over to the other player as they were both crossing from one side to the other and now each of them had a copy of the same chest: and its contents.Dupers!What I had seen was an exploit based on the \u201Careaserv\u201D boundaries that split up the playable gameworld of Ultima Online.UO never did anything the easy way; after all, its first generation of designers were trying things \u2014 inventing entirely new things \u2014 that later online games would simply shake their heads at and say \u201Cnah, that\u2019s too hard.\u201DFor instance: how to load-balance thousands of players in a huge 29,360,128 meter² game map in 1997?Instead of having different \u201Czones\u201D with loading screens or \u201Clong, foggy mountain passes\u201D, the UO developers just invented rectangular, seamless \u201Csub-maps\u201D with a (fairly!) invisible method that just let you walk from one side to the other, all while things on the other side were still visible and updating in real-time.Thus, each game server (or \u201Cshard\u201D) you played on was actually divided into \u201Careaservs\u201D and there was some incredibly well-written \u201Cmirror\u201D code that handled communicating gamestate, object conditions, and events from one side of the border to the other.But crossing those borders as a player, sometimes, was noticeably laggy.Aside: If you look at the areaserv map above you may notice that Britannia should\u2019ve been divided up a bit more carefully so that areaserv boundaries didn\u2019t cut through important\/populated gameplay areas\u2026 look at poor Buccaneer\u2019s Den: there\u2019s a reason those hidden, underground tunnels were never fun to PvP in.The areaservs were essentially copying your player character and sending over a bundled message between themselves containing all your info. Once a player crossed the boundary it destroyed the old copy of the player on the initial side.And it wasn\u2019t just players: autonomous mobile objects (mobs) like monsters, animals, and NPCs could cross them as well.(Note: for future exploits those monsters and animals also had their own backpacks\/inventories players could piggyback exploit attempts on; lots of llama drama.)Naturally, any given bug with the areaserv code represented the greatest probable source of \u201Cduping\u201D exploits, especially when coupled with purposefully manipulations of a player\u2019s gamestate before the server backup\/shutdown sequence each morning.And after I joined the UO team I learned a few things:It really felt like we were constantly on the backfoot; we couldn\u2019t be very proactive about dupes and depended on player reports & customer service to identify egregious exploits.Then, one day I had this weird idea.There are a couple of things you have to know about UO as it was in the mid-2000\u2019s.#2 was the biggest problem with trying to find dupes: UO\u2019s gamestate wasn\u2019t in a \u201Cdatabase\u201D \u2014 there was no way to query for player possessions or objects to find illicit goods. It was 4gbs of binary blob; the data only made sense when loaded back into the game itself.I tried though: I *wanted* to read the binary blobs. I *wanted* to give Customer Service tools to find duped or stolen items. It just wasn\u2019t possible with the tools of the time.Then I remembered #5, and it gave me an idea for a different line of attack.Every dynamic object in UO\u2014 whether a mobile, player, or item \u2014 is capable of storing both data and scripts on themselves.Scripts don\u2019t hold state once code execution ends, so we would store needed data in \u201Cobjvars\u201D and attach them to the same objects the scripts were attached to.The scripts themselves contained tons of \u201Ctriggers\u201D which were event handlers tied to game conditions. As I mentioned in #5 above, one of them had a name that went something like \u201CbeforeServerLoad\u201D (heck if I remember the actual name) that specifically executed during the backup loading stage of the areaserv startup process.I thought: \u201CWhat if we just *marked* the most valuable items in the game whenever they loaded from backup?\u201DI went to the lead engineer, Supreem, and asked for just one addition to the C++ code and an associated mapping to a \u201CWombat func\u201D for it: a hashing function (hello crypto!).I wanted to make the gameserv store a running list of \u201Cmarked\u201D items during the areaserv loading process to identify dupes.A global hash registry.Here\u2019s how it worked:The idea was that if a valuable item (worthy of duping) had a unique hash stored on itself as an objvar, then the duping process \u2014 whatever it may be \u2014 would copy that same objvar\u2019s value. Then there would be two unique objects both holding the same hash.The best time to check for this (in bulk) was during server loads, and that system marked all the objects with an \u201CI AM DUPED\u201D objvar.(Note: my memory may be fuzzy here, and we may have had to tie the script to the onPlayerLoad event as well; I just don\u2019t remember if players were all loaded with the areaserv or whether they were fetched from the backup data on-demand).It was a lot like stamping the rare items with some sort of invisible ink that only fluoresced under certain conditions.So we released the updated code and let it run globally for a few weeks.And then the hunt began.Mwaha. Mwahaha. MWAHAHAHAHAHA!Within a couple of weeks we realized the first phase had worked: we had found a ton of duped rare items, and they were mostly held by the same set of player accounts across multiple game servers.Despite our excitement, this is where we paused: what do we do now?We sat down to talk with Management, Customer Service, and our Community Manager.Our producer was stoked to explain what we\u2019d accomplished to the studio general manager. I remember sitting in the meeting with a smile on my face, pleased as punch (as only an arrogant young gamedev can be), just to hear something I wasn\u2019t expecting:\u201CMmm, I don\u2019t think deleting them all [the duped items] is a good idea, you\u2019ll hurt too many players.\u201DI hadn\u2019t considered that, actually.At all.I was too excited about having accomplished my long held goal to \u201Ccatch some dupers.\u201DI wanted to chafe and say something, maybe assert that he just didn\u2019t understand, but reined myself in and after the meeting I went back to the team and told them that we were forbidden from auto-deleting all the dupes.So we went to the CS team for data.It was true. It would\u2019ve been a terrible idea.The dupes spread so quickly once they were created that if we just deleted them all out from under all the players who had bought them (with their hard-earned gold) from the dupers we would be affecting a significant portion of the playerbase.Sure, some of them would be fine with the \u201Cmorality\u201D of our action \u2014 but on the scale of hundreds or thousands of affected players (per shard) we were just asking for the frustration to cause a wave of quiet quitting.I really shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by this: our studio\u2019s general manager has been running MMOs for a lot longer than I ever had.To make matters more complicated the Customer Service team started asking us hard questions, like: \u201CExactly how many duped runic valorite hammers should a person have before we ban them?\u201DWait, we were supposed to assign an arbitrary value on how many dupes being held by one person was suspicious? Oh. Oh boy.This was harder than code. It was community design, not just game design.Thankfully, we had a level-headed community manager who was used to our over-exuberance. Honestly, they were just used to managing me whenever I got too passionate about something.\u201CCS is going to ban them [the actual dupers] anyways. Why not make it an event?\u201D was about how that conversation went.Well, I was the lead live events designer, so\u2026 we plotted.We identified the dupers themselves and their storage depos: they had homes full of their duped items and NPC vendors selling them to the players.The \u201Cduping ring\u201D stretched across multiple servers, comprised of distinct groups not necessarily working together. They had all evolved the same behaviors though: making tons of UO gold from selling dupes and then selling the UO gold on secondary markets for hard cash.So Adida and I wrote a script, that, once attached to a house, would:Then, we chose a day, and struck.Customer Service mass banned the dupers on a timer, right before their associated server came online.Then we paused the gameserv\/loginserv connection to those same servers and Adida and I ran around (teleported, really) to each housing location, attached the script, watched the fires erupt with joy, and moved on.We did this in batches of related servers so that each \u201Cduping ring\u201D didn\u2019t have time to notice they were banned and try to log in on alt-accounts to empty their houses before we could get to themConfusion! Chaos! Joy! Laughter!Discussion threads popped up on Stratics and MMORPG.com almost instantly, full of wonderings and guesses \u2014 and a few false suggestions like that a CS employee had been caught up in the banning (false!).Dozens of homes had been destroyed across the entire multiverse of Ultima Online, and the flames licking the sooty rubble were a visible testimony to our team\u2019s determination to deal with cheaters.It felt fantastic!And we were told not to do it again.Lol.We took some flak for doing something so daringly public to cheating players \u2014 even though we made sure not to identify them to the other players directly \u2014 but still just barely skated by with upper-upper-upper management.Customer Service was instructed to use their discretion to deal with \u201CI AM DUPED\u201D items from then on, and honestly, by now I don\u2019t know if anyone even remembers that the system exists (if it even does).Readers who\u2019ve been exposed to NFTs might notice the eerie resemblance of us marking these rare items (which were non-fungible!) with unique hashes to how blockchain-based Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) work today.Ironically, one thing that our method didn\u2019t work on was *stacks* of objects (fungible items like gold coins).But Satoshi Nakamoto solved that problem too! The first Bitcoin paper describes a perfect method (online or offline) for validating timestamped events like currency creation. It would\u2019ve helped prevent dupes *and* ensured internal bad actors (with item creation powers) couldn\u2019t just generate a bunch of gold to sell outside the game.Not that I\u2019m saying MMOs need blockchains; but it turns out Proof-of-Work ledger technology had a use case here! (No wonder Amazon now offers a similar service: QLDB).Finally, one of the biggest things we learned was having to deal with the economics *after* the fire: especially when players wanted to compete for the now available, very premium, housing spots.But that\u2019s another story.Tim \u201CDraconi\u201D Cotten was the lead game designer of Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss, and when he\u2019s not writing up stories from the wild days of online gaming is working on applying all those hard-won lessons to Metaverse design.Follow him on Twitter for more Ultima related stories!","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*A4ceavp9FCDSql6meIhrTw.jpeg","author":"Tim Cotten","title":"That Time We Burned Down Players\u2019 Houses in Ultima Online","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/cotten-io\/that-time-we-burned-down-players-houses-in-ultima-online-7e556618c8f0","tags":[]},{"summary":"Exponential wealth is only possible in markets that are new and inefficient.","date":"Apr 17, 2024","post_content":"I've been in Crypto since 2017.I'm nonchalantly strolling into my 3rd cycle with an air of confidence this time around.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*CFOjKpk_8MxTLCZ8","author":"Jayden Levitt","title":"Top-Tier Data Scientist: This Crypto Cycle Is Your Last Chance To Make Generational Wealth.","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/datadriveninvestor\/top-tier-data-scientist-this-crypto-cycle-is-your-last-chance-to-make-generational-wealth-856147d54849","tags":[]},{"summary":"Unlocking Crypto Wealth: Your Path to Success in the Digital Currency Era.","date":null,"post_content":"The digital gold rush is on! Cryptocurrency has taken the world by storm, attracting investors seeking high returns and a glimpse into the future of finance. But with its rapid price swings and complex terminology, the cryptoverse can feel intimidating for newcomers. Fear not, aspiring crypto trader! This guide unlocks the secrets to earning in this dynamic space, equipping you with the knowledge and strategies to navigate your path to success.Before diving in, let\u2019s break down the fundamentals. Cryptocurrency are digital assets secured by sophisticated cryptography. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by governments, crypto operates on decentralized networks, meaning there\u2019s no central authority pulling the strings. Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, the first and most famous, Ethereum, known for its smart contract capabilities, and Litecoin, a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin.Think of this as the stock market for crypto. You buy crypto at a lower price with the goal of selling it for a profit when the price rises. Success hinges on researching market trends, understanding technical analysis (analyzing charts and patterns to predict future prices), and making calculated decisions. Start small and learn the ropes before going all-in.This advanced strategy allows you to borrow funds from the exchange to magnify your potential profits. However, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. You can also amplify your losses, so it\u2019s best suited for experienced traders with a high tolerance for risk. Proceed with caution!This involves making multiple trades throughout a single day, capitalizing on short-term price fluctuations. It\u2019s like surfing the waves of the crypto market, requiring a deep understanding of real-time movements and lightning-fast decision-making. Day trading can be lucrative, but it also carries high risks. Only jump in if you have the nerves and expertise to handle it.Here\u2019s a passive way to earn crypto. Staking involves locking up your crypto assets in a designated pool to support a blockchain network. Think of it as lending your crypto to the network for a while. In return, you earn rewards in the form of new crypto tokens. It\u2019s a low-risk option with good returns for long-term investors who don\u2019t mind their crypto being tied up for a predetermined period.Similar to lending money at a bank, crypto lending allows you to lend your crypto to others through a platform and earn interest on the loaned amount. Interest rates vary depending on the platform and the borrowed crypto. It\u2019s a good way to make your crypto work for you while someone else borrows it.This advanced strategy involves locking up your crypto in liquidity pools on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. These pools provide the necessary liquidity for crypto exchanges to function smoothly. In return for supplying liquidity, you earn high yields in the form of new tokens. However, be aware that DeFi is a complex space with inherent risks of scams and smart contract vulnerabilities.Only venture into yield farming if you fully understand the risks involved.The future of gaming is here! Play-to-earn games allow you to earn crypto tokens by playing. These tokens can be used within the game itself or cashed out for real money. It\u2019s a revolutionary concept that combines entertainment with earning potential. However, be wary of games that seem too good to be true, as some can be scams.Some crypto projects distribute free tokens to raise awareness and attract new users. Keep an eye on reputable crypto news sources to stay updated on potential airdrops. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Do your research before participating in any airdrop.Become a crypto evangelist! Promote crypto exchanges or projects and earn commissions for every user you refer who signs up and trades. It\u2019s a good way to earn passive income if you have a social media following or a blog dedicated to crypto.The crypto market is known for its volatility, meaning prices can swing wildly in a short period. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Start small and gradually increase your investment as you gain experience and confidence. Remember,crypto shouldn\u2019t be your only investment strategy.Before throwing your hard-earned money at any crypto project, research it thoroughly.Here's what to dig into:Understand how the project\u2019s technology works and what problem it solves.Who are the people behind the project? Do they have a strong track record and relevant experience?Does the project have a clear purpose and a large enough market to be successful?Cryptocurrency is digital and exists online, making it vulnerable to theft or loss. Store your crypto in a secure wallet.These are physical devices that offer the highest level of security. They\u2019re like tiny USB drives for your crypto.These are digital wallets accessed through an app on your phone or computer. They\u2019re more convenient but slightly less secure.Spreading your investments across different cryptocurrencies minimizes risks. Just like with traditional investment portfolios, diversification is crucial. Don\u2019t go all-in on a single project, no matter how promising it seems.The crypto market experiences significant ups and downs. Stay patient, maintain a long-term perspective, and don\u2019t make impulsive decisions driven by emotions. Remember, some of the most successful crypto investors bought and held for years.The world of crypto is constantly evolving. New projects, technologies, and opportunities emerge all the time. Make learning a continuous process.● Read reliable crypto news sources.\n● Follow industry experts on social media.\n● Participate in online communities and forums.\n● Take online courses or watch educational videos.Remember: Crypto is an exciting but risky market. This guide empowers you with the knowledge to make informed decisions and explore various ways to earn within the crypto-verse. Approach your journey with a cautious yet curious spirit, prioritize your financial security, and most importantly, have fun exploring the decentralized future of finance!Fear and greed are the enemies of successful crypto trading. Stick to your research, and trading plan, and don\u2019t let emotions cloud your judgment. If you find yourself getting emotional about the market, take a step back and come back later with a clear head. By following these tips and putting in the work, you can crack the crypto code and build a sustainable path to success in this volatile market.

Jaffer, NSI Founder and Executive Director, and John Poulson, NSI Public Policy and Government Relations ManagerThis article originally appeared in Barron\u2019s on September 23, 2022. Read the full piece here.This summer has seen chaos in the cryptocurrency market, with major corrections in digital currencies and key crypto institutions. Many looking at this scenario \u2014 like former Clinton-era Labor Secretary Robert Reich \u2014 believe these events highlight the need for extensive new regulation of this nascent market, including potentially treating cryptocurrencies as tradable securities. In our view, this is exactly the wrong time to be imposing massive new securities-style regulations. The result would be to strangle this new industry or worse, push it overseas.The right approach is to recognize the most recent correction for what it is: the appropriate \u2014 albeit belated \u2014 functioning of markets to address widespread overextension. The crypto market may be able to benefit from some broad regulatory guidance and basic guardrails to protect consumers and national security, but we ought not let our zeal for regulation drive this important industry into the ground.There can be little question, as many have noted, that crypto has long been dramatically overvalued relative to its fundamentals. As such, not only was the recent correction likely, but it is actually a much-needed remedy to overheated speculation. It demonstrates that traditional market mechanisms can still work well, and that the feverish increase in valuations of both cryptocurrencies and crypto companies was overblown.Crypto\u2019s dramatic rise and disruptive impact also created challenges. The presence of unsavory early adopters \u2014 including nation-state actors bent on disinformation, hackers exploiting weak security to get paid, and those hiding illicit financing schemes by governments, terrorists, and other criminals \u2014 has sparked a valid backlash from many government officials when it comes to seeing crypto as a legitimate private store of value.However, if we do what many long-time regulators and academics like Reich and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler want \u2014 like applying ill-fitting securities laws to this new industry \u2014 we may severely stifle our nation\u2019s ability to remain at the forefront of this transformative technology. Though there is little doubt that cryptocurrencies can, if misused, pose a critical threat to our economic and national security, it is also true that, if harnessed correctly, crypto can help maintain American leadership of free and open markets. Likewise, appropriately limited regulation can easily correct some of the excesses we\u2019ve seen to date.To that end, Congress should initially set out a broad policy framework, ideally in bipartisan legislation, like the proposal by Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. It sets out the key policy objectives for crypto regulation, including accounting for national security issues, and seeks input from the executive branch about which agencies, if any, ought to regulate in this space and what regulatory approaches they would propose in light of the congressional policy framework. Only after setting out such a framework and getting input back from the executive branch should Congress provide detailed and narrow regulatory authority to one or more federal agencies.Such a process might be longer and more involved than usual. But it is particularly important where, as is true of crypto, there are economic, national security, and innovation imperatives that cut in a range of directions. Moreover, given the speed of evolution in the crypto industry, taking a careful, more deliberate approach to regulation, including getting significant, detailed buy-in from Congress, seems like a better path forward.To be sure, any regulation will have to address the real problems of money laundering, sanctions evasion, terrorism financing, and other criminal behavior we\u2019ve seen in the crypto market, as well as the implications of this new technology for the traditional nation-state monopoly on monetary policy. Many of these challenges can be seen in the Treasury Department\u2019s recent decision to sanction the virtual-currency mixing service Tornado Cash for its use in money laundering and sanctions evasion. A vigorous debate has erupted over whether the use of property-based sanctions is consistent with the law.Ensuring that crypto innovation takes place in free economies and creates more financial inclusion, rather than being hijacked by authoritarian nation-states that seek to control their own people and export repression abroad, is critically important. The open, rules-based, private-market system built by the United States and our allies is the right home for this innovation, not the lands of digital authoritarians and human rights violators.It is more critical now than ever \u2014 as the crypto industry works through the correction \u2014 that we embrace and encourage its development as a transformative capability with the potential to promote important U.S. economic and national security objectives. Of all the areas in which the government might regulate, this is one where a strong bias in favor of innovation and against rash action is key.Jamil N.

It reveals how the earliest single-celled organisms swimming about in a sea of molecules began to compete\u2014not intentionally but through the process of natural selection. Those that managed to thrive in their environment were more likely to propagate their genes, meaning their offspring would represent a higher percentage of the gene pool and would, in turn, have a higher chance of spreading their own genes through the same cycle.At its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true: First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (\u201Cheredity\u201D). Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (\u201Cvariation\u201D). Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (\u201Cscarcity\u201D). Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (\u201Cno oversight\u201D). The rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology, and nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection (whereas the other three typically are), but I believe it to be just as important.In the human-made digital world, there are also \u201Corganisms\u201D. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).And furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.Yet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions\u2014scarcity and no oversight\u2014exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper. While most of the focus on Web3 today views it as a technology of interest in its own right, there is a different perspective that is worth exploring: that it is a means to an end, a platform for enabling other phenomena to develop. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.I want to focus for a minute on that fourth requirement of natural selection, the no oversight piece, which we should just call decentralization. Just as the \u201Cinvisible hand of the market\u201D is simply the emergence arising from many individual self-serving components (i.e. buyers and sellers) interacting, life too is an entirely decentralized phenomenon. There is no authority dictating who survives and thrives. It is the environment. It is the collective emergent outcome of all interaction within that environment.In the Web3 digital world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology.By establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for instance), software can take the form of organisms in this new world (let\u2019s call them Cryptorganisms for the purposes of this discussion) and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain. Each instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.(A quick aside: If you\u2019re enjoying this article, please consider subscribing to my free weekly newsletter, Z-Axis, by clicking here!)It\u2019s worth exploring one possible real-world example of this Blockchain Darwinism. This is intended purely as a thought experiment, a starting point.Imagine a newly minted digital asset I\u2019ll call Charliecoin (after Darwin, of course). Like most cryptocurrencies, Charliecoin is limited in supply. While Charliecoin can be traded or transferred, it cannot be bought, sold, or converted to another form.Each day, new Charliecoins are minted, but the quantity of the new supply is entirely unpredictable. One day, 72,000 new coins might be minted. Then for a week, there might be none (a drought of sorts). This would simulate the unpredictable conditions of a hostile habitat where the availability of life-sustaining resources fluctuates erratically.Anyone can create Cryptorganisms, which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that have smart contracts conforming to certain rules. These rules represent the biological rules of the system. For instance, they specify how many Charliecoins a Cryptorganism needs to survive so that it doesn\u2019t \u201Cdie\u201D.On top of that infrastructure, gaming mechanics can be built. Developers can define ways for Cryptorganisms to interact with each other. Perhaps one such \u201Cgame\u201D permits two Cryptorganisms to battle for a winner-take-all wager of some Charliecoins. Perhaps another permits two Cryptorganisms to \u201Creproduce\u201D and defines the (somewhat random) process by which their offspring NFT gets defined.Two financial incentives could exist for human \u201Cplayers\u201D to participate in the development and growth of the ecosystem. First, a holder of a Charliecoin can earn actual money (whether in the form of cash or other cryptocurrency) for every day they hold it; therefore, there is a driver for growth of one\u2019s Charliecoin stash which, by virtue of getting consumed to sustain \u201Clife\u201D, will otherwise eventually be depleted. Second, a developer can earn actual money (again, either cash or cryptocurrency) every time one of their \u201Cgames\u201D is played between two Cryptorganisms; therefore, there is a driver to continue innovating on top of the platform.Writing about this idea made me think of the phenomenon of robot combat TV shows that emerged in the late 90s, like Robot Wars and Battlebots. What I find interesting about this concept is that it enables a type of \u201CGame of Life\u201D platform to exist that does not actually allow human beings to compete directly. Instead, they must innovate on the abilities of software (in the form of Cryptorganisms) to be their proxies for competition.And what would come out of this endeavor? Perhaps nothing more than an entertaining way to watch two robots engage in semi-autonomous combat. Or, perhaps, by watching this world unfold on the blockchain, it will help us move just a little bit closer towards a broader understanding of how life came to exist and evolve in the real world.P.S. I used the phrase \u201CGame of Life\u201D earlier. This whole concept is, in many ways, inspired by the work of John Conway and his Game of Life. In Conway\u2019s version, there are zero players, and the game evolves organically without human intervention. In this version however, the game only evolves through human intervention.If you enjoyed this article, please consider subscribing to my free weekly newsletter, Z-Axis, by clicking here!","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*Q_d7WECnhEf7YLbu","author":"Nir Zicherman","title":"Can Life Exist on the Blockchain?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@NirZicherman\/can-life-exist-on-the-blockchain-4a4f672a4367","tags":["Web3","Cryptocurrency","Blockchain","Blockchain Technology","Startup"]},{"summary":"Greetings NOW followers,","date":null,"post_content":"HOW TO JOIN & HOW IT WORKS?First, you need to join our Discord, all of the tasks and rewards will appear on our Discord server.After that, you can connect your Twitter account to our server, simply navigate to the #🤖・commands channel and type the command \/set twitter, followed by your Twitter ID to link your account and start and earning points.Stay updated with daily tasks: We post engaging tasks on Twitter daily.

Can web5 be the answer?","date":"Jun 22, 2022","post_content":"It\u2019s 2022 and we are living in the opening scene of a dystopian Black Mirror episode.The line between what is real and what is fake has already blurred. The line between who is real and who is fake is now rightfully getting much more attention. It\u2019s all over the daily news:Sure, while it\u2019s still easy to tell it is not actually Björn shimmying on stage, it is becoming increasingly impossible to tell the humans from the robots. I mean, what will happen once machines become better at us at correctly identifying the three images of the 9-square grid image that contain traffic lights? Then what?As actual humans, we better protect ourselves before the bots learn how to optimize for their own rights and self-interest.Whether bluffing in an online poker table, taking on a troll in an online forum, or chasing an avatar on your Peloton, I think we have a right to know with certainty if our adversaries are man or machine.Where is the line?Bots beings bots is no issue. It goes wrong when bots masquerade as human life forms. It\u2019s iffy, but still not too creepy, when an artificially intelligent chatbot answers basic customer support questions. But when algorithms deliberately misrepresent themselves as an actual human, without disclosure \u2014 this crosses a bright line.Consider that researchers at UC Berkeley and Lancaster University have learned that fake human faces can be reliably constructed to be seen as more trustworthy than actual faces.As humans, we are heavily influenced by \u201Csocial proof\u201D (hat tip AileenLee) \u2014 the intuitive behavior that when we see others doing or saying something, we give it (sometimes unwarrented) credence \u2014 by outsourcing the due-diligence to others.Social proof is powerful, and explains why Brits love to join a queue, even when they have no idea what it\u2019s for.Social proof is why eBay auctions with more bids attract new bidders (start your auctions at $0.01, people), why startups with existing investors more easily get follow on investors, and so on.Social proof works well when the proof is from real humans. But it is a social disaster when huge numbers of bots parrot a false narrative to manufacture artificial confidence by manipulating our instinct to trust the wisdom of crowds.If so many people are saying so? It must be true.In March, the BBC reported a discovery that 75 Twitter accounts managed by the Kremlin use a so-called \u201Castroturfing\u201D playbook where legions of bot accounts amplify constructed narratives through a coordinated network of millions of fake accounts retweeting fake news: \u201C75 Russian government Twitter profiles which, in total, have more than 7 million followers. The accounts have received 30 million likes, been retweeted 36 million times and been replied to 4 million times.\u201DLet\u2019s be realistic though. We can\u2019t expect the bots to identify themselves as such. Instead, it will have to be the other way around: we must find a way for humans to authenticate as human, and demonstrate proof we are actually real.As a European resident, I benefit from the culture, policy, and technology that is invested into protecting personal privacy. Legislation like the EU\u2019s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (\u201CGDPR\u201D) protects consumers like me from unwarranted data collection and over-reaching tracking, and offers defense against a tsunami of invasions of personal privacy both online and off.European legislators believe humans have a right to own their own privacy, and have even made law \u201Cthe right to be forgotten\u201D which provides humans a legal mechanism to be deleted from databases and delete all personally identifiable tracking data.I agree with the principle that individuals should have full control over their personal identification and their own privacy \u2014 revealing what they choose to in exchange for convenience, personalization, or relevance.While humans have the right to protect personal privacy, we\u2019ve also learned that humans acting anonymously creates toxicity in our lack of accountability. One need only browse social media to see trolls emboldened by their anonymity as they post from their parents\u2019 basement. Newsweek describes anonymous trolling as the \u201Conline disinhibition effect.\u201D Yet, online bullies so-often stand down and de-escalate in non-anonymous face-to-face interactions.Anonymity in public forums (Reddit, Twitter, YouTube) has clearly accelerated social polarization where humans take extreme positions in order to maximize attention, earn social currency, and ultimately manipulate the social narrative. And, while we think anonymous humans act badly: the bots are much worse.Online forums which encourage non-anonymous participation has the modulating effect: amplifying actual human voices, while sidelining and discrediting the anonymous fringe. Yelp, in it\u2019s earliest days, deliberately seeded local communities with real locals, initially paying freelance writers to post real reviews in their own voices, using their actual first name and last initial. The subsequent community that joined, followed their lead, using their own personal names as their handle, and being thoughtful with a more nuanced critique. Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms also utilize authentication (example: blue tick on Twitter) to various effect \u2014 offering credibility to authenticated human contributors, which in turn counterbalances the hyperbolic content contributed by those who hide behind anonymity. Tl;dr \u2014 being non-anonymous results in more moderate behavior.We didn\u2019t use to worry too much about infiltration of fake humans into our lives. The technology wasn\u2019t there, and our intrinsic ability to detect fakes was until now, mostly good enough. But, the technical barriers to creating unlimited fake human profiles online are gone. The cost to creating millions of fake digital profiles is negligible, while the possible destruction such profiles can cause has become suddenly unfathomable.Skeptical? Look no further than the risk of even perceived voting fraud, let alone the devastation of actual voting fraud.We suddenly face a toxic cocktail concocted of very alarming ingredients:This might not end well.At the very least, we must find a way to securely, privately, and non-anonymously create a trustworthy credential that authenticates each of us as human.Ideally a non-anonymous human authentication with fully controllable individual privacy settings secured by a trusted neutral party.Wait, what? There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, so let\u2019s take it one concept at a time.At financial institutions (banks) everywhere around the world, there are common and often legally required fraud-abatement practices called KYC (\u201Cknow your customer\u201D) whenever customers open new accounts. The process involves passports, drivers\u2019 licenses, utility bills, birth certificates, and a combination of other official documentation assures the bank that (a) you are a real person, and (b) you are who you say you are. Banks require this authentication to manage their risk.These same KYC principles are needed for online platforms and services.Welcome to New Social Media Corp. To activate your account, either scan and submit four forms of ID, or simply authenticate with your HumanID.Consumers should only have to share and provide personal information that they choose to \u2014 and will generally want to share only as much as is needed, but not more.Imagine a hierarchical graduated pyramid of personal information starting at the lowest level (\u201CLevel 0\u201D) \u2014 which asserts you are an actual unique human being \u2014 gradually cascading to age, gender, nationality, home address, billing information, tax ID, medical conditions, all the way to (gasp!) genetic code (\u201CLevel 999\u201D).For example, upvoting posts on a public forums on a might only require \u201CLevel 0\u201D authentication (twixbar2967 is an authenticated human being) while getting a quote for car insurance might require \u201CLevel 17\u201D (fordfan4957 is 32-year-old male with a high school diploma, married, living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, one speeding ticket, two fender benders, 14 years of driving experience).Fully controllable individual privacy settings means that while the data has been authenticated as real by the 3rd party, the access to the content is controlled by the individual who reveals it only for his\/her personal benefit \u2014 and only at their own discretion.This is perhaps the hardest piece of the puzzle to crack. Who on Earth is trusted enough to play this role? The big four accounting firms? The Swiss government? Big tech? None of the above?This is where the power of blockchain technologies may really meet its promise \u2014 as a public and unalterable ledger can act as a single source of truth. Take away the need for a trusted 3rd party at all.And just this week, tech pioneer\nJack Dorsey\n(Twitter, Block) announced his so-called \u201Cweb5\u201D ambitions along exactly these lines.The announcement website makes it plain: \u201CThe web democratized the exchange of information, but it\u2019s missing a key layer: identity.\u201DI welcome such an unalterable record that can protect my rights as authenticated human over the rights of the non-authenticated, while protecting my personal privacy, and putting me back in control.We need this.There are so many doubts and questions. It\u2019s really early to predict where this goes. But, the need is clear, and the technology exists.What\u2019s now needed is great execution of a set of neutrally governed systems which will truly puts the users (me and you) back in control of who we are and what we share.I guess that makes me a human endorser of web5.I\u2019m not a robot.Thank you for reading.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of how it works and some tips on how to use it effectively.At its core, Pump.fun operates by listing \u201CBump orders.\u201D Each time a token is bought or sold, it gets bumped to the front page. This rapid movement can create a chaotic and overwhelming experience, making it difficult to track or invest in tokens solely based on their visibility on the homepage.Instead, a more strategic approach involves sorting tokens by their creation time. This allows users to identify newly launched tokens, which are typically listed sequentially with the most recent launches at the top. Many of these tokens may not see significant activity immediately but monitoring them can offer early investment opportunities.The platform\u2019s structure can encourage rapid buying and selling, often leading to significant price fluctuations. Understanding the developer\u2019s initial investment (dev buy) is crucial as it can indicate the level of confidence the creator has in the token. Tokens with unusually high initial buys from developers might be riskier, as they can lead to substantial sell-offs.When trading on Pump.fun, setting a high slippage (around 50%) is advised to ensure transactions go through during periods of high volatility.However, this also means you might pay more than intended due to price changes during the transaction.While Pump.fun offers mechanisms that reduce the risk of \u2018rug pulls\u2019 \u2014 where developers abruptly withdraw all funds from a project \u2014 caution is still necessary. The platform ensures liquidity is locked and controlled by the system, not by the developers, which prevents them from draining the funds. However, investors should still perform due diligence and monitor the token\u2019s activity closely before investing.To successfully invest on Pump.fun, consider the following steps:Why do I say this? Based on countless trading experiences, 99% of projects will experience a significant drop after hitting Raydium, possibly falling by 50% or more.It\u2019s advisable to secure your initial capital and some profit before that happens. If you have a lot of confidence in the project, you can consider buying back in at a lower price after it launches on Raydium to maximize profits.The trading bot I personally use is \u201CPhoton\u201D and using my referral link can save you 10% on transaction fees.https:\/\/photon-sol.tinyastro.io\/@gaingainA common strategy to gain an advantage on Pump.fun is through the use of trading bots, such as the Photon bot. These bots are designed to automate the trading process, enabling users to enter and exit trades more swiftly than manually navigating the platform. The bot can be particularly useful for keeping up with new launches and reacting quickly to market changes.2. Real-Time Monitoring: Unlike the native Pump.fun interface that updates every five minutes, trading bots can monitor changes by the second. This capability is crucial for capturing the most accurate market movements and responding instantly.3. Transaction Execution: When you decide to buy a token, simply set your desired amount and execute a \u201Cquick buy\u201D through the bot. This process bypasses slower manual entries and helps secure your position at an optimal price.To start trading, you\u2019ll need to fund your bot\u2019s wallet. This is usually a straightforward process where you transfer cryptocurrency (like Solana) directly into the bot\u2019s wallet. Once funded, there are several settings to adjust:While bots can enhance your trading capabilities by executing orders quickly, they are not a guarantee of profit. Effective use of trading bots requires understanding the market, knowing when to enter or exit a position, and accepting the risks associated with high-speed trading. It\u2019s also vital to avoid impulsive decisions based on the bot\u2019s speed and to ensure that each trade aligns with a well-considered strategy.Gaining significant returns on investments in platforms like Pump.fun involves more than just quick trades. It requires a deep understanding of the projects you invest in to avoid losses. Here\u2019s how seasoned traders do it using pre-launch groups to identify promising tokens before they hit the market.Pre-launch groups, typically found on messaging platforms like Telegram, are communities where information about upcoming token launches is shared. By joining these groups, investors can get early access to buy links and other crucial launch details. However, merely joining these groups isn\u2019t enough. Here\u2019s a more effective strategy:With the prevalence of scams in the crypto world, it\u2019s crucial to be vigilant. Here are some tips to help you identify whether a pre-launch group and its associated token might be worth the investment:Even with all the right tools and information, investing in crypto projects involves inherent risks. Here are some best practices to follow:For example, suppose I decide to use 10 SOL to practice trading on Pump.fun. I would only invest 0.5 SOL in each project and would cautiously invest in those that seem reliable after analysis.This approach significantly increases the success rate, and as long as a few projects are profitable, the earnings will cover the initial 10 SOL.Navigating Pump.fun and leveraging its features requires a blend of strategic planning, technological assistance, and cautious optimism. By understanding the platform\u2019s mechanics, utilizing trading bots for efficiency, and engaging with pre-launch groups for insider knowledge, traders can significantly enhance their chances of making successful trades.However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency trading on platforms like Pump.fun demands vigilance and a disciplined approach to risk management. It\u2019s crucial to perform due diligence, stay informed about market trends, and assess each project thoroughly before investing. Remember, while the potential for substantial gains exists, so does the risk of significant losses.Ultimately, success on Pump.fun comes down to combining technology with smart trading practices and continuously adapting to the fast-paced crypto environment. By following these guidelines, traders can navigate Pump.fun more confidently and potentially achieve consistent profitability in their trading endeavors.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*FAaV1LlJkXMwL9Z0IyhMHQ.png","author":"Gain Gain Crypto","title":"HOW TO MAKE $600 DAILY ON PUMP.FUN CONSISTENTLY(not clickbait)","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@gaingain\/how-to-make-600-daily-on-pump-fun-consistently-not-clickbait-304ecff5e3b8","tags":[]},{"summary":"There are just over five days remaining to convert your RAMS inscriptions (or have them automatically destroyed, releasing RAM back to\u2026","date":null,"post_content":"There are just over five days remaining to convert your RAMS inscriptions. As a community member who just converted her inscriptions, I wanted to share some information for those who are still deciding whether to transfer RAM to the DAO (to receive RAMS tokens) or to reclaim their RAM (and burn RAMS tokens.)This article is intended to inform the EOS community who participated in the RAMS inscription event, though it can also serve to provide more information on EOS RAM and the RAMS DAO. This is not financial advice, do your own research.EOS RAM is an EOS system resource that is used to store data on the blockchain. It is sold on the EOS RAM marketplace and is priced based on the Bancor liquidity algorithm. On December 17, 2023 an msig proposal was passed to stop RAM inflation on EOS, making it a finite resource at 390GB. The EOS community has been cumulatively experiencing the full range of emotions due to the changes that have been occurring over the past several months (the RAM price chart).There are some major changes to EOS tokenomics being proposed and one of the major focal points of this proposal is a large allocation to the EOS RAM market. You can read more about the tokenomics proposal in this article.Some high level (RAM-relevant) takeaways from this proposal:\n- 35M EOS to be used to purchase RAM from the system\u2019s Bancor pool to support or fund various EOS Ecosystem initiatives.\n- 315M EOS to be lent out to professional market makers who will acquire RAM from the Bancor pool and the open market.In order to make an informed decision on whether or not to convert your inscription to RAMS tokens (releasing the RAM to the DAO) or to reclaim the RAM to your account (and burn the RAMS tokens) it is important to consider the following information.Who is the RAMS DAO?\nThe RAMS project was incubated by EOS Labs.Current RAMS holders can be seen here. Notable RAMS Whales include EOS Network Foundation (admin.grants) and EOS Labs (eoslabs.eco).RAMS DAO multi-signature group consists of: EOS Labs, BP Defibox, BP EOSNation, Labs member rams.base and Labs member Startship.eos.How much RAM?\nIf all RAMS tokens were created, then the RAMS DAO would manage 46GB of RAM (out of the finite 390GB supply on EOS). You can check the RAMS DAO account information here to see how much RAM the DAO currently manages.RAMS Token\nRAMS serves as the governance token of the RAMS DAO. RAMS can be staked to obtain voting rights and receive rewards.RAMS Maximum Supply: 1,000,000,000Currently 43.98% of RAMS have been minted with 4.82% of that supply burned. Check the ramseos.io website for the latest numbers.But what will the DAO do?From the RAMS DAO Website:RAMS DAO IncomeIncome for the DAO will be obtained by leasing RAM to third-party projects. The following tweet indicates that Exsat will be leasing RAM from the RAMS DAO.If you participated in the RAMS inscriptions event, your choices are as follows:Convert the Inscriptions to RAMS Tokens\n- Destroy inscriptions, receive RAMS tokens and release the inscription\u2019s RAM to the RAMS DAO for management.\n- You cannot convert RAMS back into RAM (that RAM now belongs to the DAO), but you can trade it here.\n- This action removes the RAM from the open market and puts it under the management of the DAO.Release RAM from the Inscriptions\n- Destroy inscriptions, release the RAM back to your account and burn the associated RAMS tokens (sends the tokens to eosio.null).\n- Reduces circulating supply of RAMS, but also reduces the amount of RAM managed by the RAM DAO.\n- The released RAM is available for trade on the open market.Do Nothing\n- Inscriptions will be destroyed at the end of the conversion period, releasing RAM back to your account and burning the associated RAMS tokens.https:\/\/ramseos.io\/\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ramseos\nhttps:\/\/t.me\/rams_in_ram\nhttps:\/\/bloks.io\/account\/ramsdao.eos\nhttps:\/\/rams-3.gitbook.io\/rams\/v\/english\nhttps:\/\/bloks.io\/account\/ramsms.eos#keys (msig group)","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*95XyCfYXnems9v0Jz4IMlA.png","author":"Ash","title":"RAM and RAMS on EOS\u200A\u2014\u200AInformed Inscription Conversion","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@ashonweb3\/ram-and-rams-on-eos-informed-inscription-conversion-0f647fd16353","tags":["Eosnetworkfoundation","Eos","Blockchain Technology","Blockchain","Blockchain Development"]},{"summary":"I feel for Celsius, Three Arrows, Babel Finance and whoever the next floater happens to be.","date":"Jun 21, 2022","post_content":"I feel for Celsius, Three Arrows, Babel Finance and whoever the next floater happens to be.Just two months ago, taking a loan out against your crypto was \u201Chow the rich people do it.\u201DNow, with my portfolio down 90%, my loan collateral topped up and no dry power left to slurp the dipperino, there\u2019s literally nothing left to do but wait.Wait, and build.I think we can all agree that the current sate of crypto user experience is completely unacceptable:I could go on.For new entrants there are countless situations where it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s happening. Communication is poor, basic functions are not smooth, expensive mistakes are easily made and trust is easily lost.We have about a year before the next bitcoin halving\/ bull cycle in which to alleviate this pain.To that end, I\u2019m writing a series on the crypto product areas I think are in most urgent need of attention.This one will focus on decentralized applications (dApps).Let\u2019s get into it.Usually the most important CTA on any dApp is the Connect Wallet button.But with the constant stream of news about crypto scams and hacks, people are understandably anxious about losing their assets by accidentally connecting to the wrong dApp.Currently, no dApp that I\u2019m aware of does anything to help allay that fear and instill trust.Let\u2019s improve this situation by communicating some information about the platform that might help people feel safer about connecting.Such as:There could be other things you might want to flex here but you get the idea.Other things:Another easy one that surprisingly few dApps offer is support for a variety of different wallets.While Metamask is by far the most popular wallet for ERC20 tokens and all the other tokens that reside on EVM compatible chains, there are others.And the list seems to keep growing. Even Robinhood is now getting into the non-custodial wallet game.Rainbow offers a nice configurable plugin for a Connect Wallet button which pops up a modal that has all the wallets.Out of the box, this is far better than the standard offering you usually see of Metamask, WalletConnect and maybe one or two others.But I would recommend customizing it for the needs of your target audience and to match the style of your dApp.Like other banking and finance apps, dApps that facilitate transactions provide a confirmation screen which summarizes the details of the desired action and asks the user to confirm.More often than not, these screens completely miss the mark.Unless you\u2019re a crypto developer, you probably don\u2019t understand jargon like GWEI and Royalties.These terms are confusing at best. At worst, they make users feel like they\u2019re getting mugged by hidden fees.Include the specific action in the title, put the most important information at the top and include the maximum amount of detail underneath.We don\u2019t need to eliminate the jargon completely, but use this opportunity to educate people on crypto terms.The example above is specifically for sending crypto and includes details that are specific to that action. But confirmation screens are used for a HUGE variety of tasks, not necessarily even financial.It may just be a signature required to change a minor thing or to grant additional permissions to the dApp.The details on the confirmation screen must be tailored to the task.Do not show \u201CAmount: 0, Gas: 0, Royalty: 0, Total: 0\u201D if the action is to update permissions.Once you confirm the transaction, that\u2019s often where things really go downhill. We expect crypto payments to be nearly instant but depending on the chain, they can be quite slow.The amount of information conveyed on a transaction status screen varies a lot between different dApps.Sometimes this is for technical reasons. An increasing number of crypto platforms do not actually custody assets themselves, but instead use custodial services like Fireblocks.Fireblocks does not currently relay any on-chian transaction data through their API other than transaction status (pending, cancelled or complete). And even that info is not in a format that updates automatically (you need to refresh the page to see if the status changed).Lame.However, there are innovative solutions to this problem. For example, BitPay built a monitoring client that senses any blockchain transaction on one of their wallets and relays all the data in a webhook. And it\u2019s open source.This is not a small piece or work, but even dApps using third party custody services like Fireblocks could implement it in order to show users a detailed transaction status.So basically, no excuse.Remember how much info was conveyed when you downloaded a file over dial-up internet on Windows95?TMI? I actually don\u2019t think so.If your transfer status screen is a half-ass effort, you need to fix it immediately.I have seen the help desk messages that people write when they are feeling that pit deep in their stomach when they think they may have lost their funds. And they are not okay.dApps do not typically have help desks.All the more reason to get this right.There should never, ever be any doubt as to what\u2019s happening with a transaction.Transaction status may include:On February 19th, Twitter started blowing up with claims that people were getting their NFTs transferred out of their wallets without permission or sold for very low prices.The exploit coincided with with an OpenSea contract migration, wherein they sent out an official email with instructions for NFT creators on the platform to manually migrate their collections.Apparently, the exploiter basically copied OpenSea\u2019s email template and sent it out with a link to a spoofed website with a malicious contract.At the time though, no one understood what was happening.Fearing the worst, NFT influencers started circulating threads on how to disconnect your wallet from OpenSea and revoke token approvals, something most people had no clue how to do.Some were going a step further and saying that any wallet that had ever been connected to OpenSea was at risk and that everyone should create a brand new wallet, pay the gas (which of course was insanely high at that moment), and transfer everything they had.Luckily, the extent of the damage was pretty quickly identified.It was bad, but not as bad as people had feared.I\u2019m not sure how many events like this its going to take for us make the disconnect button a standard feature of all dApps.Security imperative 🔐I said \u201Cempower users\u201D above because this not solely about user experience.There are principles at stake here that will be won or lost in the details.Easily disconnecting from dApps (AKA revoking access to your data) is one of the great promises of Web3 and represents a core ideological tenant of the movement.As more and more data becomes tied to blockchains, more and more dApps will be built to facilitate access to that data and do interesting things with it.This in turn will grow the amount of data on chain and power the next wave of the internet.But only if people can trust the system.And we have a lot of work to do on that front.___Thanks for reading until the end.

From a technical standpoint, it will explore the \u201Cwhat\u201D of LayerZero V2, including its design, security, and trust assumptions. From a discussion standpoint, it will also attempt to rationalize the \u201Cwhy\u201D of LayerZero through a general analysis of the core principles of the protocol and an exploration of the ramifications of V2 on other interop solutions.Here is an outline of the article:What Is LayerZero?How Does V2 Work?LayerZero and the MarketClosing ThoughtsDepending on who you are \u2014 your job, your portfolio, your education, your predilection for memes \u2014 how you understand LayerZero will likely differ. It\u2019s the same way with most crypto primitives. For instance, a financial manager, an Uber driver, and your grandmother will likely have different definitions for what Bitcoin is. In that example, Bitcoin is probably something akin to digital gold, an investment, or darknet money that is used by criminals, respectively.With that in mind, having a single definition for LayerZero seemingly defeats the purpose. Here are a few different ways to explain LayerZero, curated to a few of the most likely readers of this piece:For the whitepaper enthusiasts:Utilizing an immutable endpoint, append-only verification modules, and fully configurable verification infrastructure, LayerZero provides the security, configurability, and extensibility necessary to achieve omnichain interoperability. LayerZero enforces strict application-exclusive ownership of protocol security and costs through its novel trust-minimized modular security framework designed to support all blockchains and use cases universally. Omnichain applications (OApps) built on the LayerZero protocol achieve frictionless blockchain-agnostic interoperation through LayerZero\u2019s universal network semantics.For the nerds:LayerZero is a verification agnostic transport layer that enables smart contracts on different blockchains to interoperate. It is a fully connected mesh network not bound to any infrastructure or blockchain. LayerZero is an \u201Comnichain\u201D protocol enabling developers to build unified applications with modular security parameters.For the web3 developers:LayerZero is an immutable, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol connecting previously siloed blockchains. Using LayerZero, developers can send arbitrary messages across chains while preserving complete control over their application\u2019s security. LayerZero enables developers to create and configure unified applications, tokens, and data primitives, regardless of chain. This concept of unified cross-chain development is encapsulated in the word \u201Comnichain\u201D and is what LayerZero envisions the future of crypto moving towards.For the technology enthusiasts:LayerZero is to blockchains what TCP\/IP is to the internet. Where TCP\/IP allows different computers running different operating systems on different networks to communicate (resulting in a connected internet), LayerZero enables smart contracts coded in different languages on different blockchains to communicate. This allows developers to create applications that exist universally across blockchains.For your TradFi friend who you thought understood but clearly didn\u2019t:Imagine your Windows computer couldn\u2019t send an email to your boss\u2019s Mac, or your Android phone couldn\u2019t send a text message to your mother\u2019s iPhone. We take this for granted, but it\u2019s all powered by a communication protocol named TCP\/IP that glues the Internet together. LayerZero is that communication protocol, but for blockchains. Before LayerZero, Ethereum couldn\u2019t communicate with Bitcoin, and neither blockchain could communicate with Solana. With LayerZero, developers and users can interact with applications and tokens that exist on many blockchains through a single protocol, similar to how Mac, Linux, and Windows users can all communicate across the same Internet (early alpha: LZ + Solana, coming in 2024).For the dinner table at Thanksgiving:LayerZero is like the Internet, which opened up communication to the world \u2014 email, social media, zoom calls, etc. LayerZero will do that, but for crypto \u2014 meaning finance will be open, with anybody able to move value, take out loans, trade assets, etc, without going through an intermediary like a bank or a potential censor like a government.It is important to remember why we are here \u2014 to build an open and just digital economy for all people, for all time. Crypto is a space that should be permissionless, allowing anyone to interact with applications. Crypto should be censorship-resistant, facilitating the movement of data packets without judgment. Crypto should exist forever, leaving behind systems that are immutable and provable, unchanging. In general, it is pertinent that the protocol to connect crypto is designed to combat corruption so that whatever we are building in this space may stay parallel to the legacy system rather than become part of it.LayerZero\u2019s design mirrors these core principles.Endpoints (the interface for interacting with LayerZero) exist as immutable smart contracts on each chain LayerZero supports. These are non-upgradeable and cannot be changed by any party, providing a safe and predictable interface to interact with. Every piece of core protocol code is non-upgradable. Neither LayerZero Labs nor anyone else besides the owner of the omnichain application has the ability to change an application\u2019s security configuration (unless Defaults or a delegate is selected to do so).Individual messages can only be executed once all previous messages have been verified, meaning no individual message can ever be censored on any pathway. There is no ability for the LayerZero protocol to selectively deliver messages once they\u2019re successfully submitted on the source chain. If a transaction is successfully submitted on the source chain, it is guaranteed to be delivered to the destination chain.LayerZero is a pure protocol. Anyone can run the infrastructure that verifies and executes messages sent via LayerZero. If every developer and infrastructure provider stopped performing services, anybody could come in to join the protocol and pick up right where they left off. Furthermore, anyone may build on top of LayerZero and interact with those applications.The core design of LayerZero V2 can be bucketed into three categories: protocol, standards, and infrastructure.Protocol → These aspects of LayerZero protocol remain the same across every supported blockchain. In the V2 whitepaper, the protocol of LayerZero is what is deemed \u201Cintrinsic\u201D \u2014 these are the contracts that will last forever (immutable), that anybody may build on top of (permissionless) and that enforces how transactions are ordered (censorship-resistant). The protocol comprises two entities, Endpoints and MessageLibs.Standards → These enable the concept of \u201Cunified semantics\u201D \u2014 where an application\/token works the same across every LayerZero-supported blockchain. Unified semantics enable developers to easily build interfaces that interact with applications across tens of blockchains without having to rewrite code for new environments. LayerZero standards include how omnichain smart contracts are written, how data packets are structured, and how logic is composed. Anything a developer might need to launch an omnichain product from scratch can be found as audited, reusable, and battle-tested standards.While these design patterns may not seem like a big deal, design patterns are the legos for building omnichain applications and help developers create slick user experiences. For example, tokens can be bridged and swapped through a composed AB in a single transaction that only requires gas on the source chain.Infrastructure → The infrastructure layer of LayerZero is built to be permissionless: anybody can run the entities necessary to both verify and execute transactions. The infrastructure stack is also built to be completely modular \u2014 applications can choose what type of verification method it wants to use, along with what entities they want to pay for execution.The goal of V2 is not to completely overhaul a system. Instead, it is to take the V1 design and emphasize focus on the core principles of LayerZero: permissionless, censorship-resistant, and immutable.The following five changes from V1 to V2 improve the developer experience and harden LayerZero\u2019s core principles.V2 vs V1 highlights:Let\u2019s expand on X\/Y\/N and Security Stacks, as these are probably the most important concepts to understand when building on V2.X of Y of N allows an application developer to designate a quorum of DVNs to check the integrity of a cross-chain message before signing off on a message\u2019s validity. For example, \u201C1 of 9 of 15\u201D requires consensus from the following DVNs for a message to be verified:Regarding the required signer aspect of X of Y of N \u2014 this allows applications to harden their verification significantly by running their own DVN and requiring themselves to sign off on each transaction. That way, even if other DVNs collude to sign a malicious transaction, their application would be safe.X of Y of N is the core of the Security Stack, allowing applications to select, combine, and\/or remove DVNs to verify messages however they deem fit. This lets applications improve security as new verification methods enter the market or reconfigure DVNs if risks arise.Security Stacks should generally be configured based on a project\u2019s use case. For example, a cross-chain lending dApp may configure its Security Stack to the most decentralized set of DVNs possible and set a high number of blocks for confirmation, while a financial institution building an ecosystem of subnets may choose to run its own DVNs in its Security Stack with very minimal confirmation time. For inexpensive use cases or testing, developers can set a 1\/1\/1 quorum. However, if someone were to build an application that moved millions in value across chains sporadically, a quorum of 5\/20\/25 DVNs might be used.Security Stack flexibility benefits the developer because it future-proofs an OApp by not locking it into a single verification method. If, for example, a DVN were to go down due to a hack or government subpoena, an OApp could change its Security Stack to require a signature from a different DVN.This unbiased stance on verification is a design choice that differs from most other messaging protocols, which often offer only a single security configuration. Outside of IBC, Hyperlane, and a few others\u2026 most cross-chain protocols adopt a shared approach to security, continually updating a single, monolithic end-to-end security model (like a validator set, oracle, middlechain, etc) to include new chains.A one-size-fits-all approach to security will often lead to applications under or overpaying for security. For example, an omnichain NFT project has much lower security needs than an omnichain money market. However, if both are built on a middle-chain-enabled cross-chain protocol, they pay the same amount for security. In addition, using a single monolithic protocol leads to a one-size-fits-all approach to extensibility, as each verification method may only support a limited number of chains. With a modular set of DVNs, LayerZero allows developers to configure security parameters that best suit their application rather than forcing them to fit an application into a rigid, monolithic architecture.In building out Security Stacks, a diverse range of opinions is expected regarding the security of an application. There will be some proponents that say a Security Stack with just one DVN is enough (those would be developers currently building on single middle-chains), while others might say that anything less than a 1 required, 4\/5 Security Stack is insecure. Whatever might be said, LayerZero protocol is unopinionated \u2014 it is only the transport layer and will stay verification agnostic.With Security Stacks, LayerZero is the antithesis of vendor lock-in, as it allows developers to choose, modify, and combine different types of verification methods based on their specific use case.For this example, let us assume that an application (OApp) has configured its Security Stack on the LayerZero Endpoint for both the source and destination blockchains. It has also selected its preferred version of MessageLib.Step 1a: Sending the MessageStep 1b: Encoding and Emitting the Packet:Step 2: Verification by DVNs:Step 3: Receipt and Execution:LayerZero is a big idea \u2014 anything that can be programmed as a smart contract on a single chain can now be natively programmed across multiple chains (which leads to far more expressive applications being built than what currently exists on the single-chain market).Since inception, many products have been built on LayerZero, including borrow\/lend dApps, cross-chain identity dApps, bridges, NFT marketplaces, enterprise projects, NFT projects, meme tokens, and data products. Over 40,000 OApp contracts are deployed on LayerZero V1, 100s of teams are using LayerZero to power OFTs, and dozens of teams have built full-scale applications as groupings of OApps.For developers, LayerZero composability extends DeFi beyond single-chain limitations, paving the way for a more interconnected and versatile financial ecosystem. With LayerZero, the scope of applications built in DeFi expands as developers leverage more assets and blockchains. Furthermore, with the ability to run a DVN, application developers can harden security by decreasing reliance on other parties.For users, V2 simplifies cross-chain transactions, allowing them to interact with multiple blockchains without even knowing \u2014 as they only have to pay for gas on the source chain. This streamlined experience can be adopted across every DeFi vertical \u2014 from DEXs to yield farms to NFT marketplaces \u2014 reducing the complexity for end-users. The endgame for retail DeFi is to completely abstract the chain away from users, and LayerZero OApp and OFT contracts are tools to facilitate this.To give a concrete idea of what can be built with V2, here are a few examples of applications leveraging LayerZero V2\u2026There is no such thing as a perfect system. Anybody claiming to have created something perfect in crypto should be met with scrutiny, as blockchains themselves are inherently limited to a core trade-off between speed, scale, and security.This section discusses the trust assumptions, or security considerations, that a developer may encounter when building on top of LayerZero. Not all of these are protocol risks \u2014 many are practical risks that address social or application-level security. That being said, in good faith, we will address all types of trust assumptions here.(Editor\u2019s note: No pictures from here on out. Only niche interop analysis.)Smart Contract Risk: Endpoints and MessageLibs are the basis for cross-chain communication for LayerZero. If these contracts contain a bug, then the core protocol is at risk.Malicious Developers: Developers are responsible for setting their own Security Stacks. This allows them to point to malicious DVNs and\/or change a configuration at a whim if a governance or internal security process is not set up to prevent them from doing so.Diversity of DVNs: While the protocol is unopinionated, the DVNs verifying messages are not. Therefore, if there is a limited set of DVNs and applications choose to not run their own DVNs, then messages sent across the network might be censored in some way, similar to how some Ethereum validators do not include OFAC-sanctioned transactions.DVNs and Good Faith Attestation: Similar to the above bullet, it must be noted that there is a trust assumption that DVNs will not collude.Executor x Liveness: In theory, anybody may execute transactions in V2. Liveness should never be an issue, as an end-user or application can manually execute transactions on LayerZero Scan if the configured Executor goes offline. However, if, in practice, configured Executors go down frequently, there are short-term liveness concerns for applications building on LayerZero.Defaults: When developers begin experimenting with LayerZero, they can opt into LayerZero Labs\u2019 default Security Stack or set their own Security Stack. The default Security Stack is set by and can be changed by LayerZero Labs at any time. Any application that abdicates its security choice to LayerZero Labs\u2019 defaults, therefore, abdicates its security to a centralized third party. The current default setting is Google Cloud and LayerZero Labs.Endpoint Deployments: LayerZero Labs is the only entity that can deploy canonical, socially accepted endpoints. If LayerZero Labs were to shut down, that would stop the current iteration of LayerZero from extending to new chains.The cross-chain world is filled with bridges, liquidity networks, and token standards. Here\u2019s a brief outline of where LayerZero fits.Much like Bitcoin is built on the idea of self-custody (ownership over the security of your commodity), LayerZero is built on the idea of Security Stacks (ownership over the security of your application).In V2, any entity that can verify a message \u2014 be it a native bridge, third-party bridge, validator set, oracle, multisig, light client, zk prover, etc. \u2014 may be used as a DVN by an application building on top of LayerZero.This section of the article will make the case that many of the most popular third-party bridges are actually just decentralized verifier networks (DVNs) that can be used as Adapter DVNs built by application owners to verify messages in V2.In other words, many existing bridges will likely end up as DVNs competing to verify messages inside LayerZero.For more context, third-party bridges are cross-chain protocols competing against each other to build the most robust, industry-trusted mechanism for verifying messages between certain subsets of chains. Examples of third-party bridges include CelerIM, Axelar, deBridge, CCIP, Synapse, Wormhole, Router, IBC, etc. The designs for third-party bridges often revolve around shared security and can be generally bucketed into three categories. Middlechains like Axelar and Synapse validate messages as a hub and emit messages to spokes. There are guardian third-party bridges that attest to the validity of messages through reputational multi-sigs \u2014 like Wormhole and Avalanche Bridge. You can think of them as oracles or attestation services that sign off on cross-chain messages for a fee. The last type of third-party bridge is of a somewhat more vague bucket, which we call trust-minimized systems. These involve either zk proofs, light clients, or optimistic proofs, which can be boiled down to only having to trust one thing: math, chain consensus, and a single honest watcher, respectively.No third-party bridge has quite cracked the code on the \u201Cbest\u201D form of security. Middlechains compete to build the most unhackable hubs. Guardians compete to bring in the most reputable players in crypto to attest to cross-chain transactions. Trust-minimized systems use the finest tools that math, blockchains, and game theory have to offer.While each of these entities can send\/receive arbitrary data across chains, that is not what third-party bridges are exceptional at. These third-party bridges are actually excellent at verification \u2014 at proving that this message happened over here and can be sent over there.With the new V2 design, these third-party bridges, as DVNs, get to focus on what they do best \u2014 signing off on valid cross-chain transactions \u2014 and applications select the third-party bridges they want based on use-case preferences. This design should be a win-win, as third-party bridge designers no longer need to worry about execution and\/or transmission of cross-chain messaging, and applications are no longer locked into a single verification method when building something that exists on multiple blockchains.By allowing third-party bridges to do what they do best (verify things), LayerZero can focus on the main idea: unified semantics \u2014 allowing developers to compose contracts in the same way, regardless of chain. Every data packet sent and every endpoint interacted with on the LayerZero protocol is identical. LayerZero is built to allow developers to pick and choose from every type of verification method available on the market. It is a permissionless, censorship-resistant, and immutable structure that can be filled with any type (or combination) of verification method. This is powerful, as it future-proofs LayerZero against advancements in verification techniques while allowing for universal blockchain composability through a standardized messaging design.Any type of liquidity network can be recreated on LayerZero.Another bucket of \u201Cbridges\u201D are cross-chain protocols that allow for the transfer of tokens across chains. These are called liquidity networks. Examples include Across, Hop, Portal, Connext, Stargate, Allbridge, DLN, UniswapX, Hyphen, Catalyst, and cBridge, among others. Most liquidity networks are designed around a basic intent structure: a user has asset X on Chain A and wants asset X on Chain B. A liquidity network matches an intent with a solving mechanism that is either onchain (liquidity pools\/wrapped assets), offchain (often dubbed relayers), or a mixture of both. These solving mechanisms essentially take the user\u2019s token on Chain A and unlock\/fill the same amount of tokens on Chain B. They charge a small fee for this service. The competition amongst liquidity networks can be found in bridge price execution, fees, number of tokens offered to users, and transfer time.Something interesting about liquidity networks is that the verification method used underneath the liquidity network is somewhat arbitrary. Like how multiple AMMs can be built on top of Ethereum, many liquidity networks can technically be built on the same verification network. UniswapX emphasizes this point \u2014 it spent an entire whitepaper only talking about the liquidity aspects of the protocol (fillers, dutch-auction, optimistic execution, etc.) while not naming the underlying verification network it might use! All the whitepaper says is that a \u201Csettlement oracle\u201D is necessary, which could be \u201Ca canonical bridge\u2026 light client bridge, or a third party bridge.\u201D Anything passing a message between chains can be the settlement oracle here! This character trait is not unique to UniswapX. Other liquidity network designs like DLN and cBridge and Wormhole\u2019s Portal and Catalyst could likely use other third-party bridges (aka DVNs) for settlement.What these liquidity networks need is not necessarily a single third-party bridge \u2014 rather, they need a verification method they can trust depending on the chain pairing and use case. With V2, LayerZero could theoretically support each liquidity network for messaging (settlement) while allowing them to choose unique verification methods (Security Stacks).LayerZero V2 offers a single messaging framework for many different types of liquidity networks to be built using different Security Stack configurations. This broadens the scope of what can be made and should result in fun experimentation. For example, a cross-chain AMM might select a Security Stack based on trade size, with the idea that different trade volumes will be settled by different Security Stacks (essentially bridge aggregation through Security Stack optionality).The modular blockchain thesis, the L2 scaling thesis, the omnichain thesis \u2014 all of these ideas require universal token and contract standards so that the world of 1000s of chains can operate without fragmentation and context switching depending on each new chain\/asset\/VM pairing. Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs) and Omnichain Applications (OApps) aim to be those standards \u2014 extending developer capability without compromising security.With V2, LayerZero should have a good chance of becoming the single framework for cross-chain tokens and governance, as it offers a universal messaging solution with a modular verification layer.In other words, a token or governance setup can use ANY type of verification method \u2014 or combination of verification methods \u2014 to move data to a destination chain using V2, with the only trust assumption being the sanctity of LayerZero Endpoints (a trust assumption that cannot be escaped with any other solution, either).Overall, the case can \u2014 and maybe should \u2014 be made that OFTs and OApps become the de facto contract standards for all tokens and contracts moving forward for teams building on LayerZero-supported chains. Here are a few reasons why:LayerZero\u2019s architecture \u2014 modular at the verification level while static at the transport layer \u2014 strikes a crucial balance of current performance and future-proofed design.The technology is here for us to build an open and just digital economy for all people, for all time. As an industry, crypto has to work together to bring that vision to fruition. By nature of that shared goal, our technologies must be permissionless.For that vision to succeed, this philosophy must be upheld at every level of the stack. LayerZero defends these values down to the packet level.When features are mutable, values can always be changed. Promises aren\u2019t permanent. Decisions aren\u2019t durable. Upgrades are risks. Eventually, systems are corrupted.Permanence and provability must be hard coded.That\u2019s why LayerZero is here. That\u2019s why LayerZero exists.LayerZero is built so you don\u2019t have to trust others. It\u2019s built so you can trust yourself.For more information on V2, check out this thread, read this article, or check out our docs.To learn more about LayerZero in general, check out the website.

Considering the perks and security features of adopting blockchain technology, many industries have started adopting it.But a fact here is, that the term blockchain is known only among the tech people that too only the name. The rest of the people are not even aware of blockchain. Probinar took it as a motto to share knowledge about this outstanding technology with people all over the globe. By learning this technology, many perks can be reaped in the future that can be discussed further.Now, let\u2019s take off this article with\u2026Blockchain is a digital ledger that is used to store and maintain data securely. It is a distributed ledger where multiple parties can access the blockchain at a time. The core benefit of blockchain is that it is very hard to change or alter the data stored within it. It needs full approval from all the participants of the blockchain to grab data. The term blockchain exactly describes the collection of data(blocks) joined together to frame a blockchain.Multiple blocks collected together form a hash and connecting hashes frame a block. Several transactions or data entering a blockchain will be converted into a digital code with encryption and decryption techniques, checked by the validators, and stored in a block. Several blocks connected frame a blockchain.The following are the major benefits that come along with leveraging blockchain technology for your business.Not only these, as per this article\u2019s title, we shall discuss\u2026Learning about blockchain is crucial for several reasons, from career advancement to fostering innovation. Here are some key points why should you consider gaining a solid understanding of blockchain technology.Blockchain is not just a buzzword; it\u2019s a thriving industry with a growing demand for skilled professionals. Companies across sectors such as finance, healthcare, supply chain, and technology are actively seeking individuals with blockchain expertise. Job roles like blockchain developer, blockchain engineer, smart contract developer, and blockchain consultant are gaining prominence, offering lucrative salaries and career growth. By learning about blockchain, you position yourself to take advantage of these emerging opportunities and future-proof your career.Blockchain technology has the potential to transform traditional business models and create new ones. Entrepreneurs and innovators are leveraging blockchain to build decentralized applications (dApps), launch cryptocurrencies, and develop new financial products like decentralized finance (DeFi). Learning about blockchain allows you to tap into this spirit of innovation, enabling you to conceive and develop ideas that can disrupt existing industries or create entirely new markets.One of the core features of blockchain is its security. Transactions on a blockchain are recorded in a tamper-resistant and transparent manner, ensuring data integrity. This security aspect has applications across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and government. By understanding blockchain, you gain insights into how to create secure systems that protect sensitive information. This knowledge is invaluable in a world increasingly concerned with data breaches and cybersecurity threats.Blockchain introduces the concept of decentralization, reducing the need for intermediaries in various processes. This decentralized approach fosters trust among participants, as transactions and data are verified by a distributed network rather than a central authority. Learning about blockchain can help you understand how to build trust in systems, which has applications in areas like voting systems, supply chain management, and peer-to-peer transactions.Blockchain has fundamentally transformed the financial industry with the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding blockchain allows you to navigate this new financial landscape, including concepts like digital wallets, smart contracts, and decentralized exchanges. This knowledge is not only useful for personal investment but also for developing financial products that cater to the growing demand for decentralized finance (DeFi).As blockchain technology continues to evolve, its influence will extend to more aspects of our digital lives. From digital identity to decentralized cloud storage, blockchain applications are expanding rapidly. By learning about blockchain, you stay relevant in this digital era, ensuring that you are equipped with the skills and knowledge to adapt to new trends and technologies.As we discussed earlier, blockchain education is beneficial, whereas learning blockchain with Probinar is highly beneficial. Here, I shall list the benefits attained by choosing Probinar. Those benefits include:Learning about blockchain is a strategic investment in your future. Whether you\u2019re seeking career advancement, exploring entrepreneurial ventures, or simply interested in technology, understanding blockchain can open doors to new opportunities and insights. Its ability to promote security, transparency, decentralization, and innovation makes it a critical area of study for anyone looking to thrive in the digital economy.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*o-0RMxJ7l68kVx5HVjvF0w.png","author":"Probinar","title":"Blockchain education with Probinar: Your ticket to thriving in the digital economy!","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/cryptocurrency-scripts\/blockchain-education-with-probinar-your-ticket-to-thriving-in-the-digital-economy-bad6693d8270","tags":["Blockchain","Digital Economy","Blockchain Technology","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin"]},{"summary":"DeSoc, for all its talk, has a very dark element as proposed","date":"Jun 13, 2022","post_content":"There has been much talk recently of a new paper by Weyl, Ohlhaver and Buterin on soulbound tokens and their use to create Decentralised Society or DeSoc. The paper provides a potential way of powering web3 by virtual of tokens that are attached and used to establish unique identities on the web. That sort of thing is critically important for web3 as I discussed here. But read the paper carefully and there is worrying element with regard how it might use those identities in practice.It starts with the common issue that many who push for blockchain solutions to things worry about \u2026 decentralisation.The reason this is a concern is that the whole point of establishing unique identities is so that governance is not subject to coordination. In blockchain circles one such concern is the 51% attack where a single entity controls the majority of the \u2018votes.\u2019 But there is more than that:To do this the authors propose \u201Ca protocol [that] could examine the correlations between SBTs held by different Souls and discount votes by Souls (pooling them as only partially separate) if they share a large number of SBTs.\u201D What do they mean by this? There isn\u2019t much discussion but what they mean is plain for all to see in the mathematics left in an appendix to the paper.Suppose you have three people who are part of a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). They are deciding on something and they could vote on what to do based on quadratic voting that has some nice properties (but that isn\u2019t critical to the story). They show that three voters \u2014 Abdu, Shou and Belle \u2014 can vote for good outcomes if they do so independently.But what if some of the voters have something in common, such as where they work?They don\u2019t take the extreme approach. Instead, the authors argue that a \u201Csimple approach, which we call \u201Cclustering,\u201D would put two co-workers \u201Cunder the same square root\u201D in the quadratic formula to offset their tendency to already coordinate.\u201DThere is a lot going on there. Basically, the move is away from one person, one vote to taking the votes of people who are presumed to have some common interest \u2014 in this case, where they work \u2014 and then putting them together to weaken their force. In other words, their votes count for less!And it is not just one dimension but potentially a whole lot of dimensions that could determine your power in voting before getting a chance to vote.Now I\u2019m not going to necessarily equate the authors\u2019 motives with voter suppression tactics that are used except that they really seem to be that. I mean what else do we call limiting the voting power of people with certain affiliations and characteristics?Why are the authors led down this dark path? The reason is that something like quadratic voting can really be exploited when people coordinate their actions. In that way, they can get together pre-vote, work out a plan that is good for them as a group and obtain that outcome via coordination which is better for them than what is likely to arise if they all vote independently. One way to deal with that is not to use quadratic voting. The other way is to adjust this. It is that path that the authors lean into.But there is a reason that we don\u2019t like fiddling with characteristics and affiliations this way \u2014 it makes some people more equal than others. And who is to say how this should occur? The whole point of voting on stuff is to surface what we don\u2019t know and that is more valuable precisely when we can\u2019t have the knowledge to presume that we will know what an outcome will be. This is a slippery slope towards exclusion which would surely be anathema to the whole exercise.The authors seem enamoured by the autonomous part of DAOs rather than the need to engage in policing explicit collusion or coordination \u2014 i.e., vote selling. Indeed, almost as an afterthought in the appendix, the authors discuss \u201Cpairwise matching\u201D which is based on the idea of one of them that monitors the network for specific attacks. They realise its advantage in that \u201Cit has the important advantage that it does not require an extrinsic source to specify who is coordinating and who is not; instead, this information is extracted from the contribution values themselves.\u201D There are dangers here but it is akin to policing voter fraud rather than pre-emptively discounting the votes of some people.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*80jvOslUCwhvk76g.jpg","author":"Joshua Gans","title":"DeSoc\u2019s Dark Heart","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@joshgans\/desocs-dark-heart-e20448866363","tags":[]},{"summary":"The following is a summary of the Yield Guild Games (YGG) Treasury Update, which follows up on the February 2024 Community Update and\u2026","date":"May 2, 2024","post_content":"The following is a summary of the Yield Guild Games (YGG) Treasury Update, which follows up on the February 2024 Community Update and outlines the status of Yield Guild\u2019s treasury of assets as of April 1, 2024.Yield Guild Games (YGG) has undergone an evolution from being the first and largest web3 gaming guild to the first web3 protocol enabling the formation and growth of onchain guilds. Through its partnerships across games, web3 infrastructure projects, and guilds, YGG addresses a primary challenge of the gaming industry \u2014 targeting high-value players and driving community engagement.With over 100 web3 partners, eight regional guild partners, and two user acquisition products, YGG continues to build an ecosystem where great games and communities intersect. Supported by the Yield Guild Games Association (Yield Guild), which has maintained a carefully managed treasury, YGG has created a sustainable environment where players can have access to premium assets enabling them to build their onchain reputation and earn rewards.As of April 1, 2024, Yield Guild\u2019s treasury holds US$67 million worth of assets, divided into three categories: Token Positions, NFT Gaming Assets, and Network Validators.Token PositionsToken positions make up US$62.6 million, or 93.5% of the treasury. Vested tokens make up US$43.2 million, further broken down to US$17.1 million in stablecoins and large-cap tokens, and US$26.1 million from tokens of games and partners. The remaining US$19.4 million is in unvested tokens, SAFTs and SAFEs.NFT Gaming AssetsYGG holds US$4.0 million in vested assets and US$405,000 in unvested NFTs.Network ValidatorsYield Guild has 56.1 million OAS tokens, valued at US$5.3 million, staked on the Oasys Network. The Association also has 1.0 million RON tokens, valued at US$4.1 million, staked on Ronin. Lastly, Yield Guild staked 548,000 XPLA tokens valued at US$157,000.\u201COn the back of a long bear market, we are very happy with our strong position in terms of both vested tokens as well as our position with gaming tokens and NFT gaming assets,\u201D said YGG co-founder Beryl Li. \u201COur position has benefited greatly from our proactive role as a validator for three important networks in the web3 gaming space. In total, we have earned in excess of US$3.0 million in validator rewards. We are really looking forward to strong growth in the year ahead as more of our partner games come online and the YGG community drives gaming adoption forward.\u201DWith a strong treasury, YGG has over 20 months of runway for business operations, extending into 2026. In the next 12\u201318 months, projects will launch with Yield Guild holding assets in these games and services.Yield Guild has been able to defend, maintain, and grow its position even during the bear market, with the treasury reflecting this success. The Association is poised to leverage its position as new games launch in 2024 and 2025. The Yield Guild treasury will continue to be used to make strategic partnerships, build an onchain guild network, and further improve questing products.View the full Yield Guild Games Treasury Update here.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*vCBskrLQGWegAH2N","author":"Yield Guild Games","title":"Yield Guild Games: Treasury Update\u200A\u2014\u200AApril 1, 2024","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/yield-guild-games\/yield-guild-games-treasury-update-april-1-2024-3b3d6c017f77","tags":["Cryptocurrency","Blockchain","Gaming","Games","Web3"]},{"summary":"The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) sets standards for the web, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials\u2026","date":null,"post_content":"The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) sets standards for the web, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). These act as verifiable information packages about a subject (holder) with identifiers, attributes, properties, and credentials. Those follow an Issuer-Holder-Verifier model, which may differentiate a little in blockchain deployments since verification in the decentralized world makes use of features like cryptography suites and delegated logic (Smart Contracts).\nVCs are increasingly used in education, E-Governments, healthcare (EHRs), and many more.Why are VCs Important? Because of its broader acceptance; W3C VCs are acceptable by a wide variety of digital services and systems (banking, health, governments, tourism, transportation, etc). The future of identity and credentials is 100% digital and eventually decentralized since blockchains are the most fit-for-purpose solutions addressing identity and credential-specific requirements like provenance, tamperproof-ness, trust establishment, verifiable timestamping, privacy, and more.Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are essentially digital versions of real-world credentials like diplomas, certificates, permits, or licenses. They offer a secure and verifiable way to manage these credentials mostly in an inclusive and decentralized way. Here are some of the key features of Verifiable Credentials:How are VCs Stored?VCs storage is defined by two major factors:Given these two decisive factors, VC storage may be implemented by one of these approaches:Verifiable Credentials provide a secure and private way to manage digital credentials. While the core information is stored securely in your digital wallet, the blockchain serves as a trusted record-keeping system for verifying their authenticity.Verifiable Credentials and NFTs:It\u2019s important to understand the distinction between VCs and NFTs. VCs are not NFTs themselves, the NFTs here are a tool that can be used to represent or link to VCs. This misconception is quite common. NFTs can be part of the VC system but are not mandatory. In the case of GoPlausible VC system distribution and Gora verifiers, NFTs are part of the Verifiable Credentials microsystem which is called #PLAUS within the PLAUSIBLE protocol context. Verifiable Presentations (VP) as well can also be used with NFTs.NFTs are linked to Verifiable Credentials in a well-known structure named Linked Data and are not mandatory in Verifiable Credential scenarios, but since the Web 3.0 community leans toward NFTs as means of non-fungible data blocks and also because NFTs are cool and fun, those are used within the PLAUSIBLE protocol to present Verifiable Credentials. Gora verifiers, although supporting the NFTs for DIDs and VCs, do not necessarily require them to operate (e.g contract based NFTs or even non-NFT VC implementations are as well supported by Gora thanks to cutting-edge multi-chain data layer I\/O Gora has created.Verifiable Credentials are not \u201Cminted\u201D or \u201Cmintable\u201D because those are not tokens. However, it is NFTs within Verifiable Credential systems that are minted and mintable during the VC operations. In many VC operational scenarios without NFTs, no minting occurs at all (smart contract-only micro-credentials for example).Gora\u2019s Role in Verifying VCs and the Partnership with GoPlausible:Gora, in collaboration with GoPlausible, has implemented the tech stack to verify issued VCs in the Algorand blockchain. This verification occurs by checking the validity, authenticity, and assertions of the DIDs, VCs, or VPs separately from the GoPlausible and PLAUSIBLE protocol, using one of these two types of verification approaches:GoPlausible has been collaborating with Gora on several fronts for quite some time now and one of those is the implementation of DID and VC verification by Gora (as of separation of concerns required in ID and Credentials ecosystems) to achieve a 100% separated yet integrated and interoperable service under Gora to verify DIDs and VCs independently.\nThe air-gapped registration, distribution (happens on the GoPlausible side), and verification (happens on the Gora side) guarantee the security, integrity, and authenticity of W3C identifiers and credentials ecosystem on the Algorand blockchain as well as advocating the spirit of collaboration and #togetherness in the Web 3.0 ecosystem.According to Gora\u2019s innovative multi-chain efforts, GoPlausible is confidently planning on harnessing Gora nodes for future expansions to Multi-chain and other Web 3.0 ecosystems because of the proven and reliable technology delivered by Gora.Verifiable Credentials costs:Ownership security and anonymity:While Verifiable Credentials are hard linked to a recipient\u2019s Algorand account, losing control or access to the wallet containing that account (through hacking or other means) doesn\u2019t necessarily mean losing the VC itself.Here\u2019s why:However, losing access to the account does create some problems:In summary, while losing a wallet or account access doesn\u2019t directly erase or change the VC, it limits your ability to demonstrate its ownership (till you regain control using one of the remediation methods mentioned earlier).None of the PLAUSIBLE and Gora protocols are concerned with the security of Algorand accounts as they both just work with Algorand wallets for accounts and signatures and rely on their account security as both are interop protocols only. So in terms of security, seed phrase, account recovery, and other account and private key-related concerns, wallet providers are the sole resource and source of action.These being clearly stated and regarding Verifiable Credentials, the good news is that soon and by the emergence of SSI (self-sovereign Identity) service by GoPlausible and Gora, if the private key (or its seed phrase) gets compromised in any way, then by acknowledging GoPlausible there are ways (using real identity verification through KYC, KYB,\u2026) that will lead to revocation and re-issuance of all credentials to new accounts but the process include fees and presentation of at least one of verified ID documents included under SSI (e.g. there may be an ID card, Driving license, passports,\u2026) with user\u2019s picture and the actual user being in possession of the device requesting this (Camera for face verification will be activated).Blockchains are not just about anonymity and crypto trading in the shadows! One of the main advantages of blockchains is real-world usage scenarios and utilities for which users need to present real identity and credentials (for example, you will not be able to obtain a driver\u2019s license, a diploma, or a passport anonymously). That being said, Verifiable Credentials are designed to preserve privacy to the most possible extent through features like ZK proofs, selective encryption, and selective disclosure, all coming soon to the Algorand DID and VC ecosystem very soon by GoPlausible and Gora collaborations.About GoPlausibleGoPlausible is a decentralized protocol on the Algorand blockchain that provides tools for the issuance, registration, and distribution of W3C-compliant DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and smart utility NFTs in a permissionless and user-friendly manner. GoPlausible aims to expand transparent Web 3.0 services to Web 2.0 through the innovative development of new features in Identity, Credentials, Authentication, Authorization, and Smart utility NFT domains in accordance and compliance with living web standards.\nFor more info visit: https:\/\/goplausible.com\/About Gora NetworkGora Network is a next-gen decentralized Oracle platform that provides secure and reliable access to real-world data for blockchain-based applications.

The record of which wallets have which tokens is available for all to see on Bitcoin, Ethereum and anywhere else. You may not know who actually owns the wallets but there is a record there.Which brings me to Twitter. Twitter is a public record of messages associated with an account. You don\u2019t know for sure who owns an account (unless they are verified) but you know that the account has given permission for certain messages to be listed in the ledger. Unlike blockchains, those messages are revocable from the ledger itself. But like blockchains, any message that was once part of the ledger can usually be recovered and so it is hard to remove messages completely once they have been public.Which brings me to Elon Musk. In one of the many statements he made upon agreeing to buy Twitter, Musk wrote:The key phrase is \u201Cauthenticating all humans.\u201D That could actually mean pretty much anything so I am going to do what any sensible commentator would do in this situation which is to write what I think that means, why it is valuable and, therefore, assert that this is what Musk has in his mind all along.Which brings me to Paul Graham. Graham was the founder of Y-combinator and wrote a very short essay in 2009 on \u201Cwhy Twitter is a big deal.\u201D Here is most of it:You can see the relationship to my previous statement that Twitter is a public record with messages associated with accounts. The messages themselves have records and so are easy to point to by others. That is the heart of communications protocol.Communication protocols work best when you can authenticate when a message comes from a specific person. This is why email and phone spam have threatened previous protocols; phones are pretty much useless but email was recovered. They are the bots taken over which is something Elon Musk, at least, is worried about on Twitter (although one wonders whether that is really a \u2018famous\u2019 rather than ordinary people problem there). At times, the same issues have been obvious to Apple (hence, iMessage\u2019s success) and Facebook which at an earlier time wanted to use its own email service to solve that problem.Twitter, being a public record, offers a potentially easy way of authenticating people. You often see people use it with messages like this:This was a service called Mirror that I set up an account on. I was then able to associate that account with my Twitter identity. That still doesn\u2019t verify if either of them is associated with me in the real world but it starts to get at something. It is one of the methods proposed in the soulbound token paper I discussed last week.Herein lies the authentication that Musk might be talking about. If people could have their Twitter accounts verified to be associated with a real human, then by virtue of the Twitter public ledger, that could be used to associate that Twitter account and, by consequence, the human behind it with all manner of other accounts. If you can do that, you can get all of the web3 benefits from identification that have been outlined as well as providing a layer for all manner of identification.Of course, there are many who might not want that. I am not going to argue the pros and cons here. My goal was just to point out the possibility inherent in what Twitter is. It has already started to be used in that way but one can imagine that paired with other blockchain-like technologies it could go further. Is Twitter the best way to achieve all of this? I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that it is there are a few hundred million people who are happy to use it which gives it a considerable headstart.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*U0EeuG939mEpRS_1w0BmGw@2x.png","author":"Joshua Gans","title":"Is Twitter a public ledger?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@joshgans\/is-twitter-a-public-ledger-5257e1064926","tags":[]},{"summary":"Web3, simply put, is the next generation of the internet.

It\u2019s a departure from the way we\u2019re used to experiencing the online world. Unlike the traditional model, where central authorities like tech giants or governments have a strong grip on how things work, Web3 is all about decentralization. This means power is spread out across a network of users, making decisions more transparent and resistant to control.Think of it as a shift from a top-down structure to a community-driven one. In the world of Web3, users have more say, ownership, and control over their online interactions. It\u2019s like a digital democracy where everyone has a voice.This guide is your gateway to understanding this exciting new digital landscape. We\u2019ll break down the core principles of Web3, demystify complex terms like blockchain and dApps, and show you how these concepts are being used in real-world applications. By the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have a solid grasp of what Web3 is all about and (hopefully) get you acclimated to the new era of the internet.Demystifying Web3Web3 Defined: Often categorized as the decentralized internet, Web3 represents a departure from the centralized platforms (Web2) that currently dominate the digital space. Centralized entities like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have significant control over your data and autonomy in Web2. In contrast, Web3 seeks to decentralize and democratize that control, empowering individual users.Blockchain & Its Significance: The blockchain is the backbone of Web3. It\u2019s essentially a digital ledger where data is stored in \u2018blocks\u2019 and is chronologically \u2018chained\u2019 together. Every entry is transparent and immutable, which means it\u2019s tamper-proof. The decentralized nature ensures data integrity without relying on a central authority.Tips: As you embark on your Web3 exploration, focus on mastering the foundational concepts. Familiarize yourself with the history of Bitcoin and blockchain, its different types (e.g., public, private, consortium), and its real-world applications.Setting Up Your Digital WalletThe Role of Digital Wallets: Consider your digital wallet as your Web3 passport. It\u2019s where you store digital assets like cryptocurrency, interact with dApps (decentralized applications), and authenticate transactions. Unlike traditional bank accounts, you have full custody of your funds, signifying both power and responsibility.Wallet Varieties: From browser extensions and mobile apps to physical hardware devices, wallets come in various formats. Each has its advantages and is tailored for specific use cases.Tips: Your wallet\u2019s security is paramount. Whether you\u2019re opting for MetaMask (a popular browser extension) or a hardware wallet like Ledger, always ensure you\u2019re obtaining it from a legitimate source. Store your seed phrase (a recovery tool) securely, preferably offline, and guard it as you would your most prized possession.Interacting with dApps, Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges, and Web3 Gaming PlatformsWhat is a dApp?A dApp, or decentralized application, is a software application that runs on a blockchain network. This means that dApps are not controlled by any single entity, but rather by the network of users who participate in it. This makes dApps more transparent and resistant to censorship than traditional applications, which are typically hosted on centralized servers.How do dApps work?DApps are built on top of blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. When a user interacts with a dApp, their actions are recorded on the blockchain. This means that all transactions are visible to everyone on the network, which makes it difficult to fraud or censorship.What are some popular types of dApps?There are many different types of dApps, but some of the most popular ones include:Why are dApps important?DApps have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet. By removing the need for centralized control, dApps can make the internet more transparent, secure, and accessible to everyone.Like any new technology, there are some risks associated with dApps. For example, dApps are still in their early stages of development, so there is a risk of bugs and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, dApps can be complex and difficult to use, which can make them inaccessible to some users.Despite these risks, dApps have the potential to be a major force in the future of the internet. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see more and more dApps being created and used.Exchanges and Token Trading in the Web3 EcosystemDigital asset exchanges play a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency and Web3 landscape. These platforms enable users to trade or \u201Cswap\u201D their digital assets, either for other tokens or fiat currency. Broadly speaking, exchanges fall under two categories: centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX). Each has its unique set of advantages and disadvantages, primarily revolving around custody, user interface, and functionality.Centralized Exchanges (CEX):Examples: Binance, Coinbase, KrakenDecentralized Exchanges (DEX):Examples: Uniswap, Sushiswap, PancakeSwapGaming in Web3:Platforms like Decentraland and Axie Infinity have burst onto the scene, transforming traditional gaming paradigms. Not only do they offer a virtual playground, but they also provide an economic incentive for players. This shift is evident in the different models these platforms embrace:Tips: Always conduct thorough research before interacting with a new dApp, exchange, or gaming platform. Be wary of platforms promising unrealistic returns or those lacking a transparent development team and community feedback.Additional Tips and InsightsSecurity: Web3\u2019s freedom comes with increased responsibility. Phishing attempts are rife. Always double-check website URLs, never share your private key or seed phrase, and utilize two-factor authentication when available.Gas and Transaction Fees: Primarily on the Ethereum network, transactions require a fee called \u201Cgas.\u201D This fee can fluctuate based on how busy the network is. Having a grasp of gas fees is essential to avoid excessive payments or insufficient payments, both of which might result in transaction delays.Understanding Networks: Different blockchain platforms (like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana) have multiple networks. Ensure you\u2019re on the correct network when executing transactions.Community Engagement: Tapping into Web3 communities can be invaluable. Platforms like Reddit, Discord, or even \u2018Crypto\u2019 Twitter have myriad channels dedicated to specific dApps, games, or general Web3 discussions.Closing ThoughtsWeb3 is not merely a technological evolution; it\u2019s a societal and philosophical shift.

Mostly this is, as I argued previously, because (a) it uses lots of electricity and (b) that people don\u2019t think this is a good use for that electricity. But, recently, the focus has been on the type of electricity. For instance, Elon Musk, who previously embraced Bitcoin as a payment option for Tesla, backed away given the \u2018brand confusion\u2019 associated with promoting environmental friendliness when Bitcoin was not.Musk\u2019s view is that it is not the electricity per se but the type of electricity that is at issue. At a conference in 2021, he remarked:In other words, if Bitcoin runs on renewables (solar, wind, geothermal) it will be back in Tesla\u2019s good books. The intention is to make Bitcoin non-carbon polluting. But will such a shift actually do that? Or will it just look like it is doing that? There\u2019s a difference.Let\u2019s begin by looking at some Bitcoin electricity facts. This week Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok released the new chapter of their economics textbook on Cryptoeconomics (it is a great introduction to the whole sector by the way). They provide a brief overview of the \u201Cenergy problem.\u201DBitcoin is costly as a payment system. But Bitcoin actually isn\u2019t used that much so the total cost is surprisingly small by comparison to other things. That\u2019s all very well, but if Bitcoin reaches the heights its advocates are hoping for, those costs will rise so this isn\u2019t something to be complacent about.There are, however, two important aspects to Bitcoin\u2019s energy usage that are worth noting. First, it is highly space agnostic. What I mean by that is that the Bitcoin network is global but it does not matter where Bitcoin mining and hence, electricity usage takes place. You only need a half-decent connection to the Internet to run such an operation. Other than that, you can do it anywhere. That means that Bitcoin mining will move and concentrate where on the planet energy costs are cheapest. If Bitcoin was actually a bigger thing, this could have the effect of causing electricity prices around the world to equalise. In terms of its use of renewables, the good news is that the opportunities are worldwide. The bad news is that this will be driven purely by cost considerations.Second, medium and long-term Bitcoin energy usage is highly unpredictable. If you look over the past year, the hash rate (that is, the amount of computational effort devoted to mining bitcoins) has been highly variable but it was distorted when mining facilities in China were shut down.A better view is over the life of bitcoin. Note that the hash rate rises and falls with Bitcoin\u2019s price. The correlation is far from perfect but makes intuitive sense. The reward to mining are bitcoins you might earn so it makes sense that if the value of the prize gets higher, it will pay to devote more assets (computing capacity) to Bitcoin and to run those assets more intensively.The relationship isn\u2019t perfect because (a) the number of bitcoins earned through mining has been ratcheting down over time and (b) the difficulty of the computational contest is ratcheting up over time. Both of these make mining less attractive. In other words, the \u201Cwork\u201D in proof of work is designed to become harder both over time (naturally) and also the more lucrative to contest seems to be. (For a mathematical treatment, see this paper of mine with June Ma and Rabee Tourky).What this means is that Bitcoin energy usage is as predictable as the bitcoin price (i.e., not very predictable) although the automatic stabilisers built into the computational difficulty adjustment do play a role in smoothing this out.With this background, let\u2019s evaluate the substance of Musk\u2019s proposal \u2014 that the use of Bitcoin is tied to the share of renewables going into its production. Will this do anything to promote cleaner Bitcoin?It is hard to imagine how. Bitcoin mining can be conducted by anyone which makes it difficult to coordinate how energy is used and what energy is used. But suppose, contrary to facts, that Bitcoin mining was conducted by a single entity. Then they would have an interest in boosting the price of Bitcoin. Thus, if they thought that Musk and others were likely to adopt it at a sufficiently high rate, they would allocate mining resources to be powered by renewables. So far so good.But this is 1-level thinking. The real issue is what this does for global pollution. If Bitcoin were to dramatically increase its use of renewables \u2014 maybe to be totally renewable, this will change electricity usage across all of the uses of electricity. Make sure Bitcoin is solar-powered in, say, Australia, and the price of solar-generated electricity will go up while coal-generated electricity will go down. As demand has merely shifted around, so long as electricity users other than those for Bitcoin do not care about where their electricity comes from, then nothing really will change. The total volume of electricity pollution will be the same. All that will change is that Bitcoin miners can feel better about what they are using. That said, in the long-run, investment will be encouraged for renewables and discouraged for polluting electricity. But those effects take time to happen and Bitcoin itself is still a drop in the bucket there.In order to really work what you would have to do is build a solar facility dedicated to Bitcoin somewhere (adding to total electricity capacity) and use that. But that would only be the first step. After all, if you leave it cut off from other uses, you are actually making pollution worse because you are producing renewable electricity but not using it to compete with polluting electricity which is something we want to happen. If you built it on some remote location \u2014 say, out to sea, where the only other thing that can be built is a massive Bitcoin mining rig, then maybe you aren\u2019t creating capacity that can be used for other purposes and that will be something pure. But this is an awful lot of work to get clean proof of work. Moreover, under current Bitcoin rules, this isn\u2019t going to really work unless that whole endeavour is cheaper at the margin than other sources.And why won\u2019t it be cheaper? Because Bitcoin computational demand, over the medium to long run, is highly unpredictable. That means you have to build capacity to handle the peaks and you don\u2019t know what those will be and when. That means a ton of capital tied up in the independent but clean Bitcoin mining enterprise. That makes it very costly to achieve.The \u201Clet\u2019s make Bitcoin cleaner\u201D movement does not address any real problem with Bitcoin and does not address in an impactful way the broader issue which is that of polluting electricity generation. We know that what we need there is a proper climate policy and a carbon price and then we can worry less about electricity usage and let the market sort out the cleaner sourcing options.The only other way to address this is to move to something like proof-of-stake. That\u2019s what Ethereum is doing but it doesn't seem like Bitcoin will ever be able to follow suit. The point is that there are more energy-efficient ways of running cryptocurrency networks but Bitcoin is not structured to take advantage of them.The point here is that holding up Bitcoin as something uniquely polluting and worthy of significant policy attention for this reason, is a big, fat distraction from real issues. It is a game unworthy of the so-called rationalists that make up much of the crypto community.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*mI-KgRe9RR4MYSDx","author":"Joshua Gans","title":"The Myth of Renewable Bitcoin","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@joshgans\/bitcoin-and-renewables-f4d0fa763674","tags":[]},{"summary":"Memecoins will be a big part of this crypto cycle.

This allows players to participate in games without revealing their identities, only identifying them by their cryptographic addresses, while minimizing the risk of personal data exposure or leaks.Fair play is the cornerstone of an enjoyable gaming experience, however, traditional platforms, and in recent times, even some more decentralized counterparts, have a well-documented history of altering rules or operations, dating all the way back to the birth of the first casinos in the 17th century, which inevitably hurts the players and overall experience.By using Smart Contracts, and implementing algorithms & rules that are transparently enforced and executed, and cannot be manipulated by any party, internal or external, Lottoday is able to provide completely fair results, no matter what game you\u2019re playing.But as with any new technology, with all of the benefits that blockchain has to offer, there is also growing competition, along with nearly as many challenges that, when put together, end up determining who gets the biggest market share, and how fast mainstream adoption can be achieved.However, this is where strategic partnerships come into play, so let\u2019s discover how Lottoday is navigating uncharted waters with the help of our partners!Every time a new block of data is added to the blockchain, some energy is used, usually referred to as a transaction cost or gas fee. This means that every time a player is participating in a game, buying a Lottery ticket, or even just making a prediction in a game, they pay a small amount as a fee. This cost can vary depending on the blockchain used, the amount of network traffic, the supply of validators, and the demand for transaction verification. If the platform uses a blockchain that is energy inefficient or has bad scalability, those costs can quickly add up, cutting into the users\u2019 potential winnings.By partnering with ULTRON FOUNDATION, a TOP Layer-1 blockchain that supplies Lottoday with an energy-efficient, fast, and scalable solution as the backbone, we can provide players with some of the lowest transaction fees on the market, usually costing less than $0.0001per transaction, while still making games available on other major blockchains to increase accessibility.Attracting users to Web3 platforms also comes with its own unique set of technological challenges, especially when players have no prior experience with blockchain or crypto.This means navigating the complicated processes of setting up wallets, bridging, or swapping your assets.That\u2019s why it\u2019s not only important to have partners with strong technology, but also to build partners with large ecosystems. Ultron Foundation is well aware of this which is why it recently teamed up with Transak, launching a new feature on UltronSwap, that benefits Lottoday users as well. It simplifies the process of topping up your wallet by allowing you to purchase tokens directly with your existing traditional payment methods, eliminating the need for bridging assets across blockchain networks.With a big selection of benefits and a strategic approach to overcoming challenges, Lottoday is on its way to becoming the biggest Web3 gaming platform. Don\u2019t wait any longer, experience the advantages of blockchain, and jump into Lottoday yourself.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*4Pj2GDRasFF_Mus7sm9v9Q.png","author":"Lottoday","title":"How Lottoday is Embracing Trends and Building Partnerships for Expansion","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/lottoday-official\/how-lottoday-is-embracing-trends-and-building-partnerships-for-expansion-af3371fbabfd","tags":["Web3 Game","Predictions","Lottery","Blockchain","Web3"]},{"summary":"1.

After this week, it is safe to say that more and more people are with them. That said, as I argued, the reasons economists give for not liking Bitcoin don\u2019t really stack up with their own usual ways of looking at things. Namely, it is not clear that it is driving illegal payments, its missing foundation makes it more like money, and in terms of wasting resources, economists usually look for market failures to evaluate that and, in the case of Bitcoin, it is unclear the market failures are there.Nonetheless, I left that discussion hanging in that I actually think there are some legitimate economic concerns about Bitcoin. But this requires us to look beyond the usual competitive markets framework and, instead, focus on one thing economists usually don\u2019t focus on (irrational behaviour) and another thing they definitely do worry about (market power).In doing this, I am going to divide my analysis into two in order to answer the question of what economic service Bitcoin is providing. On the one hand, I will consider it as a store of value \u2014 digital gold if you will. On the other hand, I am going to characterise it as purely a game \u2014 a gambling game. Crypto enthusiasts aren\u2019t going to like that. The reality is a mix of the two. It just serves my purpose to separate them out analytically as you will see. With that warning, let\u2019s go to it and start by offending people as much as possible.Noah Smith wrote about the potential uses of Bitcoin. He considered four theories but, for some reason, however, he did not consider Bitcoin to be purely a gambling game. But to an economist, that is pretty much what it looks like. And games fall into the category of being potentially legitimate economic activity so it is an odd omission.To see Bitcoin has a game you have to strip away the surrounding language that it may be a payment instrument or a normal financial asset. (By the way, much of what we consider \u2018normal\u2019 financial assets trade in markets in ways that are very game-like too so this characterisation is not unique to cryptocurrency it is just that so many people want to view it as something more that they shy away from the obvious).The game is pretty simple and was first identified by John Maynard Keynes in the General Theory. You\u2019ll have to excuse the 1936 sensibilities here but here is how Keynes described a common newspaper game:He found that this pretty much described the stock market. You put money in the market and you get more if you can correctly anticipate stocks that other investors will find attractive. Now part of that calculation may be best on what we often call \u2018the fundamentals\u2019 but that may just be a narrative. There is little reason why any old stock couldn\u2019t be suddenly found and then become attractive \u2014 I\u2019m looking at you GameStop.The fewer fundamentals there are to point to, the more likely it is going to be a pure gambling game. You aren\u2019t guessing from a static set, however, but you are playing a game of timing \u2014 or more critically, a game of chicken.In the game frame, you put money into Bitcoin because you anticipate that others are going to do so and keep doing so. That causes the price to go up which is what players in the game expect. But the players also know that this process can\u2019t go on forever. To \u2018win\u2019 at this game, you want to sell right as there are more people about to become sellers than buyers. There are plenty of people selling early \u2014 after all, without that the price can\u2019t continue to go up. And there will be plenty of people who sell late. But you want to get to the peak. So each day, you make a calculation \u2014 \u201Cis today the day?\u201D You read the tea leaves or more properly look at the mood of other players on Discord or Reddit. You always want to egg people on. There\u2019s no sense in convincing anyone that it is time to sell. Hence, there is plenty of enthusiasm and even if things get bumpy those incentives remain. After all, if you have potentially held on too long, you want to convince others that things will bounce back.The thing is, playing a game is a legitimate economic activity. For electronic games (sans cryptocurrency) spending is in excess of $50 billion per year and growing. In the US alone, casino gambling tops $40 billion per annum. Those sound like small change compared to Bitcoin but this isn\u2019t about market value \u2014 it is about how many dollars (on net) have been exchanged for Bitcoin. So for all we know it could be quite comparable. So lamenting Bitcoin is a little like lamenting Second Life. It\u2019s not for everyone but that isn\u2019t our call to make.Interestingly, the Bitcoin and crypto games get their own add ons. DeFi allows more complex trading strategies and hedging of various risks. NFTs allow you to speculate on off-shoot assets \u2014 each their own separate game of chicken \u2014 and each with their own narratives making them literally a digital beauty contest. All of this broadens the strategies and so adds to the complexity and, one presumes, potential enjoyment of it all.One reaction to this is that this might just be a \u2018bad\u2019 game. Some might argue that people could play a similar game without, say, all the electricity consumption. That may be true but one of the things that make Bitcoin work is that it is a global game free of regulation. It may not be able to get to that point without proof of work. And if there were a better game, there is nothing stopping someone from making it. (Of course, that is easier said than done and, as I will argue below, things aren\u2019t quite as simple as that).More critically, it is a gambling game. Gambling, from casinos to financial markets, is regulated. They are regulated precisely because many people can be convinced that it is not a game but it is instead \u2018investing.\u2019 Thus, they are not aware of the zero-sum nature of it all. If people are not the fully rational, calculating agents that economists often assume, we want to regulate these games to protect people from themselves. We don\u2019t want people to lose their savings. We don\u2019t want to facilitate addictive behaviours. And we don\u2019t want people to be vulnerable to fraudulent claims \u2014 and as I pointed out, the Bitcoin game is primed for claims without basis. Indeed, that can be the whole game. Thus, it is very important that people know when they are playing and understand the rules.Therefore, one reason economists don\u2019t like Bitcoin is that it can be problematic when people are not fully rational. What to do about it is another matter but that is, at the very least, a basis for legitimate concern.Let\u2019s now move to the other extreme interpretation that Bitcoin is a financial asset that acts as a store of value \u2014 that is, it is a digital version of gold (or at least the common idea of gold).I don\u2019t want to get into the debate about whether Bitcoin (or indeed gold) is a good store of value (like being an inflation hedge or something). Noah Smith has doubts, Vitalik Buterin thinks in a broad way it may achieve that aim. The perspective I want to take is to presume it is functioning as a store of value and then evaluate what economic problems might emerge from that.There are two ways of thinking about storing value. One way is in terms of use. If you hoard toilet paper (as if *that* could ever happen), you are doing so because you have calculated your expected lifetime use of toilet paper and decided it is worth getting all of that shopping out of the way now rather than overtime. The point is that the reason you are doing that, storing rather than buying, is because of potential value in use.The other way is in terms of exchange. This could apply to toilet paper too but let me use a less messy example: gold. Gold has uses but it is a store of value because it is anticipated that you can use it to buy stuff you need in the future. So it has value in exchange. Of course, while you might normally think that something has to be useful to someone else to have value in exchange (like toilet paper), gold has the property that if enough people think it can be valuable in exchange, then it can be valuable in exchange for anything. So it is fungible. The problem with this value is that it relies more heavily on expectations and a kind of beauty contest like effect than simply value in use.The nature of these expectations supported store of value is that the more people you anticipate agreeing that it is a store of value, the better and, indeed, more valuable it is as a store of value. This means that any given candidate for digital gold has built into it a network effect. One consequence of this is that there is an equilibrium where no one values it. But at the same time there is an equilibrium where people value it.The critical challenge is that if people do value it, it may be difficult to shift them out of that equilibrium. Now that isn\u2019t a problem if you are choosing between two equivalent things as potential stores of value. The fact that one wins out is OK because one was always going to win out.But what we want is for that store of value to be productively efficient. We want people to be storing stuff at the least possible cost. After all, if we all agree on what value is being stored, isn\u2019t it better that we store it in a cheap thing if possible.The problem is that new ways of storing value might arise over time. For instance, it may be that proof of stake is a lower-cost store of value than proof of work. (This isn\u2019t a given by the way.) But Bitcoin was a \u2018first mover\u2019 and so potentially has become a store of value ahead of other cryptocurrency innovations. Given this, how can we be assured that Bitcoin is now the most efficient use? If something else came along, would people switch?In economics language, the concern is that Bitcoin has monopoly power in that we cannot rely on competition to efficiently generate alternative stores of value given that expectations are somewhat \u2018locked in.\u2019 Hence, when economists say they are worried about the waste they should be saying they are worried about market power. What\u2019s worse here is that there is no obvious regulatory way of dealing with any potential market power on the part of Bitcoin because no one is in charge.I should add that even this argument is suggestive rather than proven. People\u2019s expectations are clearly not quite \u2018locked in\u2019 to Bitcoin. But they could easily get that way in the future. Then in twenty years, we might be asking whether it is the best system we could have and be frustrated that there is no way to answer that question let alone change the system if there is something better. That sort of situation makes economists nervous.Economists have been glib in their assessments of Bitcoin. There are actually legitimate economic concerns but they rely on consumer irrationality or market power arguments rather than simple distaste or even market failure. If economists are going to engage properly on their concerns, they need to articulate those concerns within standard and well-developed frameworks. At present, they look more like children saying \u201Cthey just don\u2019t like it\u201D or conservative people saying \u201Cit\u2019s not the way we do things.\u201D That isn\u2019t helping.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*JPPIao_a1LlPSiK6tyPtgQ@2x.png","author":"Joshua Gans","title":"Why Economists Don\u2019t Like Bitcoin (Part II)","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@joshgans\/why-economists-dont-like-bitcoin-part-ii-8f0b0808916e","tags":[]},{"summary":"The tokenization of real world assets has become one of the hottest topics in the blockchain space following the entry of Blackrock, a\u2026","date":"Apr 13, 2024","post_content":"The tokenization of real world assets has become one of the hottest topics in the blockchain space following the entry of Blackrock, a leading asset manager, and their recent announcement of intent to launch an \u2018RWA\u2019 initiative. The notion of tokenizing everything, from stocks to skyscrapers, has single-handedly transformed the mass perception of blockchain technology as a viable tool for economic transformation.VeChainThor, our blockchain, has long been heralded as one of the few protocols to actually deliver in this area, working with influential companies from automotive and major IT companies, to Walmart, PwC, DNV, BMW and more. Most recently, we joined forces with Boston Consulting Group and launched a new global initiative, the VeBetterDAO ecosystem, to deliver an impactful dApp ecosystem for both consumers and enterprises to tokenize real world activity and derive new kinds of value from individual behaviours.The ability to imbue physical objects with immutable digital identities has a myriad of applications, from authentication to provenance, consumer engagement and marketing to sustainability, auditing and much, much more.Whether preserving the value of a luxury product in a secondary market or helping businesses collaborate in seamless data environments, the value add of blockchain is no longer in question, and the Web3 revolution has begun in earnest, with VeChain as its pioneer.The UFC is one of the fastest growing sporting brands in the world. Our global marketing partnership, announced in 2022, not only helped VeChain gain visibility in 900 million households globally, but vastly increased our digital footprint across media channels, offered new channels for community engagement and growth, and has helped boost the adoption of the VeChainThor protocol, highlighted by the sustained, rapid growth in new addresses seen recently on the network, adding 1.2 million new addresses over the past year.While our partnership began under the pretext of marketing, we are excited to share that the relationship has grown further, entering a new phase of technological integration. During UFC300, a new set of fighter gloves will be unveiled that not only improve the safety and wellbeing of UFC athletes, but contain VeChain-powered NFC blockchain technology.At a global press conference on Friday 12th 2024, Dana White will unveil a new development to a global audience \u2014 the integration of VeChain\u2019s blockchain technology with sporting apparel that enhances both athlete performance, and improves the fan experience, offering a means of authentication and enhanced brand\/athlete engagement post-event.This development will take place on a global stage and showcase a tangible use case of blockchain to a largely non crypto-native audience. To mark the occasion, Dana White has minted an initial set of 25 exclusive gloves for distributions to a prestigious list of A-list talent, including Joe Rogan and others, placing VeChain\u2019s technology in the hands of some of the world\u2019s most influential people.As a leader in the \u2018RWA\u2019 field, having been actively developing solutions since 2015, our experience, enterprise prestige, and technological prowess places the VeChainThor blockchain in the optimal position to lead a new phase in blockchain adoption. Working hand in hand with enterprise leaders and leveraging our proven proprietary technologies, we continue to remain incredibly confident of our role as the frontrunner and deliverant of this new era of tokenization and blockchain mass adoption.For our use case with the UFC and their fighter gloves, post-fights, athletes will donate and give away their apparel. By including VeChain\u2019s NFC chips, our blockchain technology can provide an immutable record of the event itself, including the action between athletes, as well as serve as an authentication tool and introduce new ways to engage with fans of the sport. One example is through bespoke content, dedicated to a single individual, or for unique experiences, marketing opportunities or special offers, such as discounts. It also ensures the legitimacy of the item if sold or traded, eliminating fraud \u2014 a common problem for secondary markets.Today marks another step in our aspirations to drive real world adoption of blockchain. The journey is getting ready to get even faster, with regulations and institutions entering the space. We remain excited about our crucial role in building that future.VeChain, headquartered in San Marino, Europe, is the curator of VeChainThor, a world-leading smart contract platform spearheading the real-world adoption of blockchain technology, and a proud pioneer in the field of real world asset tokenization (RWA), having worked with companies in the area since 2015.By leveraging the capabilities of \u2018trustless\u2019 data (information without intermediaries), smart contracts, and IoT technologies, VeChainThor has enabled enterprise solutions across a wide array of fields.VeChain now turns its attention to the greatest challenge of all \u2014 building digital ecosystems to drive sustainability and digital transformation at global scale.Learn more about VeChain on vechain.org","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*VGHoy1RhEfdTblc9FvQsjw@2x.jpeg","author":"vechainofficial","title":"VeChain \u201CKing of RWA\u201D To Integrate Blockchain In UFC Fighter Gloves, Showcasing Real World Asset\u2026","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@vechainofficial\/vechain-king-of-rwa-to-integrate-blockchain-in-ufc-fighter-gloves-showcasing-real-world-asset-195943f4f84d","tags":[]},{"summary":"Plan Summary What is the program goal? 1.

Until there\u2019s a meeting of the minds, blockchain UX is going to suck. ( Jargon definitions: Web 2.0 is \u201Cthe web\u201D today. Web3 is what\u2019s coming with the advent of blockchain technologies. Detailed definitions of Web 2.0 & Web3.)Over the past 4+ years, I\u2019ve been dragged kicking and screaming into the actually-pretty-magical world of Web3. I\u2019ve worked, or tried to work, with a bunch Web3 founders in two categories: the crypto-natives and the pre-disastered.Crypto-natives have been living and breathing Web3 for years. They populate an enormous echo chamber of people speaking a language that most tech people can\u2019t even understand, to say nothing of the general public.I totally understand the sense of wonder and empowerment that comes from knowing you are building the future. That you know things that only your fellow travelers truly understand. And that some of these things will not only spell doom for what came before but are going to change the world. Early Web 2.0 inventors felt this same way and for the same reasons.The beginning of Web 2.0 was a time of \u201Cnew paradigms\u201D and \u201Cnew economies\u201D and new financial metrics and all the rest. What could we possibly learn from prior software projects? And how could old-school retail or catalog possibly have anything to teach us about building the web?From that perspective, it makes no sense for Web3 founders to look to Web 2.0 practices for\u2026well\u2026anything. Breaking from old standards and valuing creativity is core to Web3 DNA: everything is a candidate for revolutionary redesign. If you\u2019re a crypto-native reinventing enormous stuff like trust, money and digital identity, why wouldn\u2019t you reinvent \u2018user experience\u2019 and \u2018how to develop software?\u2019 Why use old practices to invent something new?Actually, even though the web was a very different beast from the software of the 90\u2019s, it turns out we could have learned quite a bit. Creating a clear understanding of who your users are and figuring out what they want and need (not just what you want to give them) turned out to be a prerequisite of software success. The tedious process of having users interact with designs so you could iterate them before they were launched \u2014 actually, before they were coded \u2014 turned out to save time in the long run. And time-to-launch turned out to not matter nearly as much as ease of use (have you ever heard of Friendster or Orkut?). There are examples everywhere of companies losing big because of bad UX.Check out these stats:When I talk to the crypto-native founders about the value of basic user-centered design principles, the obvious risks of having engineers design user experiences, and the fact that user experience and product make or break projects almost every single time, they semi-patiently nod. Meanwhile, their brains are churning out great reasons why they don\u2019t need any help, at least not right now.The follow-ups I get are predictable:I understand these responses. I\u2019ve heard them before. Hell, years ago, I said them myself.Let\u2019s get this out of the way: sure, there are lots of Web3 projects that have failed, but having a failed Web3 project does not mean that you have experienced product failure. If you are Web3-fluent, you can jump out of the window of the burning wreck of your failed Web3 experiment and have 14 offers of funding before you hit the ground. And if your Web3 experiment failed, it\u2019s probably not because another Web3 product had a much better UX\u2026because as I write this almost none of them do.The Pre-Disastered founders are typically Web3 founders with Web 2.0 experience. These are people who are both experienced builders and invested in the potential and inevitability of Web3 (and not all Web 2.0 people have had time to do this).Pre-Disastered founders have launched products with users in the past. They have real-world experience using things like agile and have seen user-centered design processes in action. They\u2019ve watched usability studies that have made them crumple and want to barf. They\u2019ve had to create documentation and support materials to band-aid confusing features. They\u2019ve complained about bosses who have prioritized new features over improvements. They\u2019ve lived through the cost of not doing user-centered design.Some of the Pre-Disastered are UX and product people with impressive and deep resumes. Interestingly, I\u2019ve found that most of them aren\u2019t writing and talking about Web3. They\u2019re staying off the grid and under the radar on purpose. Anonymity is all the rage with the Web3 elite, for security reasons and because it\u2019s part of the culture.Good user experience and product designers don\u2019t need Web3, so not many of them are exploring it (yet). Like leaping founders, they can exit a window and have 14 offers before they hit the ground from non-Web3 companies.Web 2.0 pros aren\u2019t all grumpy, of course, but they all have a choice. Web 2.0 experts could take gigs where their experience is highly valued, or they could move to Web3, where experience is often seen as a flaw. When you\u2019re in demand where you are, and the \u2018new thing\u2019 is technically intimidating, uses a whole new language, and seems super cliquey, why bother?Crypto natives hear about tried-and-true methods that result in better products (babies) and all they are seeing is \u201Cpeople who don\u2019t know our tech and want us to slow down\u201D (bathwater).Pre-disastered founders want to benefit from the experience, but they also face insane pressures to launch and profit.Meanwhile, Web 2.0 grumps are being told that Web3 is potentially more transformative than the internet (babies) but seeing a bunch of noisy hotshots getting money thrown at them to create ways to buy and sell pixelated GIFs for ridiculous prices (bathwater).We\u2019ve seen this combo of inflated promise and hotshot founders before (pretty much daily since 2000). The tech is new. The startup scenario isn\u2019t. (Pro tip: Expensive pixelated GIFs are to NFTs like selling books in 1999 was to e-commerce.)The result of throwing out the babies with the bathwater?I\u2019ve presented one explanation for bad Web3 UX. It\u2019s easy to whine about problems. So, what\u2019s the fix?Product and UX pros who are thinking about Web3:Insights for crypto-natives who want experienced people to help you build better products faster:\u201CSometimes, you have to let it break.\u201D \u2014 Larry Tesler*I\u2019m optimistic the Web3 natives won\u2019t be quite as blind as us Web 2.0 hotshots were. The baby-to-bathwater ratio is objectively higher. The gap between old and new is so much narrower than say between Web1 and magazine publishing and television programing circa 1996, or between traditional retail and catalog and Web 2.0.Old and new are going to have to learn from each other. And they will. Eventually. But I think it\u2019s too early to try to win the hearts and minds of the crypto native founders. First, they have to fail for themselves.This is going to change rapidly (I hope). As it does, the chasm between the wisdom of the recent past and the speed of the future will narrow. For now, I\u2019ve decided to help where help is wanted, even though I know early help from someone like me could be game-changing to any tech startup.More articles for UX people who want to learn about BlockchainMore articles for founders who won\u2019t take my word for itTamara Adlin has been in the UX field for 25 years and co-authored the Persona Lifecycle books.

Echoes of Time, a test of skill and might\u2026","date":null,"post_content":"Testing your skill in speed of completion, this new game mode pits you against the clock. There are 4 new adventures to explore in Inverdhen, and each can be run as a standard adventure, or the more enticing Echoes of Time.You\u2019ll need an initial Sigil from Thornix Stonecarver to activate this mode, depending on the rarity you choose, but as long as you don\u2019t die, you\u2019ll be able to retry as many times as you like, until you succeed and move to the next tier.If you succeed in beating the clock, your sigil will be replaced with the next tier higher, allowing you to compete at the next level!As you progress through the tiers, you\u2019ll find that monsters gain more health and are stronger overall. To really hit a home run in this mode, you\u2019re going to need to use consumables. Fortunately there are a few new items in this update which you can use in your arsenal! Additionally securing yourself a blockchain weapon, will help you make light work of this increased threat!There are a total of 4 tiers for each of the 4 new adventures, starting with Bronze, then Silver, Gold and then Platinum. There is a weekly Time Chest for any player who completes any of the tiers in any of the adventures; however note that you can only win 1 Time Chest per week. The Time Chest will be awarded for the highest rarity adventure you complete within the week and the rarity based on the tier that\u2019s completed.For example if you complete up to Gold Tier in Epic, and then move to Legendary and complete Bronze, you\u2019ll be awarded the Bronze Legendary Time Chest.There are a total of 16 Time Chests, each with increasingly more lucrative rewards. May the RNG be with you!Additionally there\u2019s an overall leaderboard to compete on, with the top 3 players in each rarity receiving an additional prize at the end of the week. The ultimate prize being the Timemaster\u2019s Chest!You\u2019ll need to complete a Quest in Inverdhen before unlocking access to Echoes of Time.The appearance of Armor has been updated, along with it\u2019s effects.The property differences between each tier of Armor has been increased and plate armor vs leather armor has a greater difference depending on your playstyle.If you\u2019re playing mostly ranged, you\u2019re going to want to secure yourself some good quality leather armor, because plate armor, which is great at mitigating incoming damage, isn\u2019t so optimal with ranged energy use.Additionally the new game mode Echoes of Time has a chance to grant rewards which can be taken to Thornix Stonecarver to create even more powerful armor.Finally, when armor breaks, it no longer breaks into Armor Remains, instead it functions the same as all other items that break. This change will help with resource demand in the marketplace.The variety of monsters has expanded to include an additional 24 new monsters! Some monsters have unique abilities which you\u2019ll need to figure out the best way to counter. They might seem daunting at first, but with a little practice you\u2019ll be owning them in no time. Other new monsters will gain additional abilities in the future.The monster population has been spread out across all adventures, with more variety added to every theme. Be sure to take extra consumables and maybe a teleport scroll if you\u2019re revisiting a favorite adventure in this update.Monster damage output has also been revised with this update to better align with the armor and other changes.You\u2019ll be able to unlock the Gem Disaggregator at Inverdhen, giving you the power to extract Shattered Gems from various items. See Thornix Stonecarver in Inverdhen for help with this.These shattered gems have multiple uses, one of which is used to upgrade armor with additional properties.Additionally you can use shattered gems to create a teleport scroll which takes you straight to Inverdhen if you\u2019ve already unlocked it!Some items have been shifted around in Alchemy and Cooking, after their effects have been updated. These changes were made to better align Alchemy and Cooking to the most recent meta changes. You\u2019ll find that fish are for restoring your health and energy, while potions are for buffing your combat.Experience values have also been adjusted to provide a smoother progression curve as you level up your skills, removing the progression curve hills that existed before.Additionally some items have been removed from Alchemy and Cooking to simplify the available recipes. See Old Item Removal and Old Item Swaps below for more information.Untethered Tonic, Spellbreak Potion, and Acceleration Potion have also been updated with a new name and effect (The marketplace listings have been cancelled for you). Untethered Tonic has been changed to Overload Serum, Spellbreak Potion to Bastion Brew, and Acceleration Potion to Precision\u2019s Peak Potion.All Blockchain weapons now have basic effects added to them, in preparation for future expansion through the Weapon Upgrade system. We also added an effect to Emblem of the Ancients.The full list is as follows:Krong\u2019Oul\u2019s Last End Conductor, Shapeshifter\u2019s Demise, Starcaller, Axe of Antagony, Cavalier Crusader, Glint of Asperity, Heartstriker, Incarnated Ravager, Mooncleaver, Night Shredder, Obsidian Defender, Pride of the Fleet, Reaper\u2019s Toll, Silent Song, Sky Spire, Stormsong, Thunderstrike, Valkyrie, Wings of Surety, Axe of the Intolerant, Blade of the Ember Pact, Blood Eclipse, Breeze Bender, Conquest, Doomblade, Fortune\u2019s Warblade, Ghost Reaver, Ice Wrath Cleaver, Long Reign, Obsidian Katana, Ritual Rapier, Silent Assassin, Silver Broadaxe, Silver Saber, Skeletal Warblade, Skull Breaker, Soul Infused Copper Warblade, Viper War Axe, Volcanic Broadaxe, Scathing Ruin, Wildone\u2019s Axe, Refereum Sword, Godslayer and Emblem of the Ancients.Morphs have been upgraded to now stay morphed until you demorph, perform an action, or take damage. There\u2019s no longer a limit to the distance you can travel while morphed, and there\u2019s no time limit that you can stay morphed. Using doors or stairs also no longer demorphs you.The cooldown after demorphing is now always 5s, instead of being scaled to the distance you travelled.Overmorph Potion has also been updated. Once activated, it\u2019ll allow you to instantly morph but at the cost of 50 energy. The effect can be used in town, and lasts for 20 minutes. The 5s cooldown after use still applies.We\u2019ve been working towards a 2 stage integration with Enjin\u2019s Matrixchain. The first tier is complete on our side, which is to allow sending and receiving of ENJ to the game and back. This process has taken far longer than expected because we discovered issues that needed resolving on Matrixchain before we could launch.This update will initially launch with sends\/receives turned off, and once we\u2019ve been able to perform further testing, we\u2019ll enable and send out an announcement that it\u2019s ready.Matrixchain also has network fees (whereas JumpNet had none) so be aware of that when you\u2019re sending and receiving your ENJ. (Although they\u2019re far less than they ever were on Ethereum). Additionally the withdraw fee from the game has been set to 0.03 ENJ and the 24 hour cooldown on withdraws has been removed. You are also able to unlink your wallet, however a fee of 10,000 Luneri applies. These fees are in place to discourage certain negative behaviors and to also help pay for ecosystem costs. They may be reviewed in the future but we believe they\u2019re set appropriately.You\u2019ll also notice that Shadowstones have been removed. We\u2019ve completely replaced all reference to Shadowstones with Enjin Coin and updated how we display the value. So before, if you had 530 Shadowstones, you needed to divide that by 100 to know that you had 5.3 ENJ. From now on though, you\u2019ll no longer need to do this, as the value in game will simply show 5.3 Enjin Coin.Please take care as you trade on the marketplace, as your muscle memory may want you to type 100, instead of 1. Double check everything until you\u2019re used to the new values!Shadowstones that you found within the game are now represented as Enjin Gems. These were always separate internally, but they\u2019re now distinct, because it\u2019s a little confusing that you could send some of your Shadowstones out of the game, but others needed to be used in the market first. Now it\u2019s very clear that if you have Enjin Gems, you must spend them in the marketplace. (This value is still only displayed under the Enjin Coin tooltip at the top of the screen)The 2nd stage of integration with Matrixchain will be recreating all of the items. This 2nd stage will be launched at a later date, once we\u2019re happy with the performance and reliability of Matrixchain and we\u2019ve heard your feedback about the whole process.The interface displayed when interacting with NPCs who exchange items with you has been improved to align better with the existing interfaces.Additionally some NPCs now have additional items available for exchange!Due to the upcoming new content, we found it necessary to rebalance certain items, as some were either too weak or too strong.Instead of attempting to adjust each individual item, we have made the decision to remove them altogether. We appreciate your understanding that such adjustments may occur during the early stages of development.To express our gratitude, if you had any of the affected items, we have credited you Gold Coins based on how many old items you held, and additional bonuses depending on how many of the items you held.The affected items are:Protection Potion, Swiftness Potion, Brute Force Potion, Antirange Potion, Dynalyte Potion, Fortification Potion, Raw Hock and Hock.You\u2019ll receive a gift containing the gold and any bonuses. You\u2019ll have 60 days to open the gift, after which it\u2019s contents will expire and the gift will disappear. (These gifts will take time to send out, and may not be immediately available when you launch the update)The below bonuses are additive, and per unique item type (Except for Elixir Evaporated which is limited to 1 per account).So if you had 650 Brute Force Potions and 250 Swiftness Potions, you\u2019ll receive: 35,000 Gold Coins, 4x Wheel of Wonder Tokens, and 1x Frostfall Siege Key.Thank you for supporting us during the early development phase of the game!We\u2019ve clarified the Alchemy and Cooking skills and therefore some items have been removed and swapped with other items instead.This greatly simplifies the consumables available and improves the quality of the remaining items.All swaps are one for one. Any of the removed items that you held, will be replaced with the other items below:(These swaps will take time to credit, and may not be immediately available when you launch the update)","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*QgciiZ18zQSfvty8eW7FEg.png","author":"Lost Relics","title":"Timemaster\u2019s Epoch","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/lost-relics\/echoes-of-time-efdacbf4df29","tags":["Videogames","Blockchain","Blockchain Technology","Development"]},{"summary":"Uncovering the bad engineering behind \u2018smart\u2019","date":"Apr 28, 2022","post_content":"Every other day you read an article on Bloomberg or the Financial Times about one of these so-called smart contracts exploding and people losing a ton of money.

It provides an infrastructure for developers to build protocols that can be utilized by fund managers and accessed by the retail investor population in a seamless manner.A $100 million ecosystem fund, supported by DWF Labs, has been established to incentivize developers to build on ZIGChain. With each new protocol, we get closer to our goal of enabling wealth generation for everyone.Wealth generation describes the process of creating, growing, and preserving financial resources. It usually involves \u201Cmaking money work for you\u201D through smart investments that generate consistent returns over time. Sounds simple enough, right?Not in reality. Traditional financial systems have made it almost impossible for the average person to access wealth-generation opportunities. As a result, the wealth gap continues to widen, with 1.10% of the world\u2019s adult population controlling 46% of global wealth, as of 2023.The factors contributing to the global wealth gap can be categorized into:Zignaly has spent six years attempting to address the limited access to wealth-generation opportunities. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we expand financial opportunities globally while remaining inclusive, user-friendly, and compliant with regulatory bodies.Hundreds of thousands of our users have collectively generated millions of dollars in profits by investing alongside top digital asset managers. The user-friendly interface and various sets of tools allow investors to make all of the profit with none of the stress.But we are just one wealth generation protocol. Imagine if hundreds of similar protocols were available to the masses. Imagine if there was an infrastructure that made it easy for builders to create these protocols and for users to access them. Well, that infrastructure is here\u2026Introducing ZIGChain, a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain on the Cosmos Network, designed to revolutionize financial empowerment through scalable and inclusive wealth generation infrastructure.Developers can build innovative wealth generation protocols, fund managers can deploy them into accessible investment strategies, and the average person can take advantage of financial opportunities previously reserved for the wealthy elite \u2014 all on ZIGChain.ZIGChain unlocks a world where any user, regardless of financial literacy, social status, or geographic location, can generate wealth by clicking a single button. Wealth management services can now be built on top of any DeFi protocol, so users get all the benefits of Web3 but with a familiar and user-friendly interface.Let\u2019s find out how ZIGChain\u2019s architecture simplifies wealth generation.ZIGChain is being built on the powerful Cosmos SDK as a modular blockchain. Today, Cosmos is one of the fastest-growing infrastructures for new Layer 1 blockchain with high scalability, interoperability, and an easy-to-implement modular framework.Cosmos is a proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain that involves staking to secure the network and validate transactions. So yes, we can finally confirm that ZIG holders will be able to stake tokens for huge rewards, and we are excited to share more details on this very soon.Choosing Cosmos enables a fast transition from idea to implementation while maintaining reliability. The developer-friendly tools and libraries in the Cosmos SDK make it the ideal choice for launching a blockchain that values security, flexibility, and speed.Moreover, the modular framework means ZIGChain\u2019s functionality can be integrated in the core of the blockchain and expanded to meet users\u2019 and developers\u2019 evolving needs. It also allows seamless integration with existing blockchain ecosystems, creating a powerful network effect.Cosmos enables us to deploy an \u201Capp-chain\u201D design that allows our core concepts of accessibility, transparency, and inclusivity to form a wealth management layer (WML) that sits between builders and the everyday investor.This WML is the DeFi manifestation of Ziganly\u2019s pooled accounts investment technology whereby users may choose to pool their funds with expert wealth managers who manage their investments. Here are just a few of the benefits that this app-chain design enables on ZIGChain:\u201CEffortless investing\u201D has been our motto since Day 1. So, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that ZIGChain has a user-friendly UX that enables anyone to participate in wealth generation practices without prior knowledge or expertise.But such a seamless user experience doesn\u2019t mean a lack of advanced features. ZIGChain comes equipped with new-age technologies, including account abstraction and Gasless technology, to make Web2 and Web3 composability a reality.ZIGChain opens the door to a future where just one button stands between a user and wealth generation. Soon, Web2 users will use their email accounts or social logins to integrate with on-chain protocols and invest in wealth management services by clicking a single \u201CINVEST\u201D button.Zignaly and DWF Labs have joined forces to establish a $100 million ecosystem fund to promote the adoption of ZIGChain. The fund will primarily incentivize and support developers in creating innovative wealth-generation protocols on ZIGChain. We are also joined by UDHC, Disrupt & score of other partners in this journey.Our message to our fellow builders is simple:The support for builders on ZIGChain doesn\u2019t stop there. Developers will be prioritized in our network\u2019s resource allocation and rewarded with a share of the core blockchain revenue. Such an approach ensures the growth and sustainability of our ecosystem as a whole.Moreover, ZIGChain is partnering with various entities to enable smart contract functionalities, both EVM and Rust, on the L1. Developers of all levels and backgrounds can build wealth-generation protocols on ZIGChain without sacrificing creativity or innovation.ZIGChain marks the beginning of a new chapter in Zignaly\u2019s journey. A testnet version of ZIGChain will be launched this summer, with more details on the overall governance structure and incentive programs for early contributors, validators, and users to follow in the upcoming weeks.With major partnerships being forged, ZIGChain, as a shared mindset of some of the biggest names in the industry, is set to disrupt the status quo and usher in a new era of financial freedom for everyone \u2014 and it\u2019s all happening in 2024.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*2zjz5UXgzpDUlMtKyBJQIg.png","author":"Zignaly","title":"ZIGChain: Unlocking Wealth-Generation Opportunities for All","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/zignaly\/zigchain-unlocking-wealth-generation-opportunities-for-all-ade91fc76d76","tags":["Blockchain","Zignaly","Bitcoin","Defi","Decentralization"]},{"summary":"In our last episode, I discussed how spaces collaborating with our service are marked with a Blue Check.

At HIDE ME PLEASE inc., we\u2019re at the forefront of this change, using the Blue Check Map to integrate online and offline experiences through a new dimension of interaction. Consider how \u2018Pokémon Go\u2019 has globally motivated people to move between real locations, blending digital and real-world experiences. Our MR (Mixed Reality) experience is designed similarly, enabling users to engage directly in virtual interactions through the Blue Check Marks. For instance, when consumers using MR devices look at the entrance of a café adorned with a Blue Check, they can vividly experience the venue\u2019s current promotions or signature dishes. Furthermore, by analyzing consumer purchase data and behaviors, we can offer personalized recommendations and tailored services, enhancing both customer attraction and marketing efficiency. MR technology not only transcends simple visits but also strengthens connections with the venues, elevating customer experiences to a new level.Commercialization Is Just Around the CornerMR devices are evolving into lighter, more user-friendly glasses. Companies like Meta and Apple are already developing this technology, which is on the verge of widespread commercialization. As mentioned, wearing smart glasses and looking at a Blue Check will display the venue\u2019s signature and promotional menus directly on the screen. Additionally, these interactions can generate advertising revenue, which will be shared with our partner venues.A Win-Win for Venue Operators and ConsumersThe introduction of the Blue Check Map and MR technology brings significant changes to businesses. First, customer visitation increases due to the enhanced experiences provided by MR. This technology encourages more frequent visits and longer stays at venues. Second, these unique interactions are likely to be shared on social media, attracting more new customers and naturally inducing viral marketing. Lastly, the special experiences offered can prompt customers to purchase more products or services. As discussed in previous episodes, if my offline activities are linked online \u2014 imagine gaining experience points or items for your avatar online after enjoying a coffee at a venue. Wouldn\u2019t you be tempted to order a dessert if it meant your online avatar would receive even greater rewards?The Future of MR and HIDE ME PLEASEThe expansion of MR experiences through the Blue Check Map will bring revolutionary changes to the retail and entertainment industries. We are ready to enhance customer experiences in unprecedented ways by partnering with a variety of businesses across sectors. As MR technology advances and becomes more accessible, our platform will establish more diverse and extensive partnerships. We aim to provide novel experiences at retail stores, restaurants, tourist attractions, and more. The increasing number of businesses adopting this technology through collaboration with the Blue Check Map will maximize the value of our services and add new enjoyment to customers\u2019 daily lives. Looking ahead, we are prepared to build sustainable and valuable partnerships and are seeking sturdy partners and investors who share and support our vision.

Here\u2019s how we could fix it.","date":"Mar 14, 2022","post_content":"College is a lubricant of social mobility, a vaccine against a creeping caste system, and a key that unlocks the American dream. Yet over the past 40 years, it\u2019s become more difficult to access and more expensive, staying more the \u201Csame\u201D (i.e., stale) than nearly any offering. We can scale social media platforms from thousands to billions of users, turn Porsches into SUVs, and lift billions of people out of poverty globally, but we can\u2019t shape a college education beyond a four-year tour of auditoriums and projectors.The sector is ripe for disruption. In any other industry, innovators would have moved in long ago. But higher education is different: It\u2019s got iconic brands (Apple and Coca-Cola have nothing on Stanford and MIT), a self-policing \u201Caccreditation\u201D system, and an unholy alliance with the financial industry ($1.7 trillion in student loan debt). So things keep getting worse. And the worst of the worst are the elite schools, who\u2019ve doubled down on their rejectionist cultures even as their endowments have exploded. The share of the student population enrolled at elite schools has been declining for decades. \u201CLet\u2019s build something wonderful, so we can share it with almost nobody,\u201D said every Ivy League President. #Gross.A bright spot? Our great public universities. For example, the University of California, which recently set a goal to add 20,000 more seats by 2030. But the sun of UC\u2019s good intentions has experienced a partial eclipse of Nimbyism (Nimby = not in my backyard). This town-gown dispute is indicative of the challenges facing higher ed, and our country.UC Berkeley has expanded its enrollment just 1.3% per year since I graduated in the nineties. More Berkeley grads is good for California, America, and the world. Berkeley boasts the second most Nobel Prize winners of all U.S. universities, produces the most Peace Corps volunteers, and is the nation\u2019s fourth-largest manufacturer of Olympic medalists.However \u2026 more UC Berkeley doesn\u2019t appeal to some Berkeley residents, who like the cultural accoutrements of a college town, just not college students or the housing they need. In 2019, the City of Berkeley and a neighborhood group sued to freeze the school\u2019s enrollment.The city and the university cut a deal: UC Berkeley agreed to pay $82.6 million to the city over 16 years (double its previously planned payout) to account for the increased burden on city services, and the city dropped its lawsuits and endorsed the university\u2019s growth. Seems reasonable.Except that the neighborhood group wasn\u2019t satisfied with 80 million bucks. It continued its lawsuit and won \u2014 relying on an environmental law from the 1970s that observers say was never meant to police population growth, let alone higher education. The kicker? The enrollment \u201Cbaseline\u201D year is 2020, when enrollment cratered, thanks to the pandemic, so the freeze will require the university to cut 3,000 students (2,000 undergrads and 1,000 graduates) from its anticipated 2022\u201323 enrollment. To minimize the reductions, Berkeley will tell more than a thousand new undergrads they have to take their first semester online and require another 600 to defer until 2023.The median sale price for a home in Berkeley is $1.6 million, nearly four times the national average. And prices keep going up (12% in the last year). Berkeley homeowners are the beneficiaries of a long economic boom \u2014 a boom that came in no small part courtesy of UC Berkeley\u2019s graduates and researchers. On the other side of the backyard fence, UC Berkeley and its students are the arbiters of change, the potential for a better future. But what we witness incessantly in America is people who\u2019ve benefited from our innovation economy pulling the ladder up behind them.In 1940 a 37-year-old had a 92% chance of earning more than their parents did at the same age; a 37-year-old today has a 50% chance. It\u2019s never been more expensive to buy a home. Since 1989, young people\u2019s wealth relative to their income has declined, while older people\u2019s has grown. Put another way, the old are getting richer and the young poorer.And while the younger generation is down, we boomers continue to kick them. Today, two-thirds of jobs require a postsecondary education and training, but college costs have increased 150% faster than average earnings of 22- to 27-year-olds since 1980. We spend 7% of our federal budget on children \u2014 the only OECD nation that spends less on kids is Turkey.Old people don\u2019t want change. They want scarcity and ossification, because it protects what they have. Young people are different \u2014 they want churn and growth, so they, too, can go buy a nice house and turn into Nimbyists.In Berkeley, it\u2019s likely California will carve an exception to the law for the UC system, but housing for students is still in critically short supply, and next year there will be another battle, another lawsuit. We can\u2019t scale America\u2019s colleges one lawsuit at a time.College towns are victims of their own success, bringing character and culture that benefit residents who register appreciation \u2014 and then want to create a scarcity ecosystem that will further buttress their wealth and lifestyle. University leaders need to adapt to a scarcity mindset in which companies, graduates, and homeowners all want less access once they have theirs.Some ideas\u2026You know who would welcome 50,000 of California\u2019s brightest students and most-accomplished researchers? Fresno. Or Davis. Or Bakersfield. Any town north of Sacramento or east of Los Angeles. Governor Newsom, if you want an unlock, build a campus in Fresno. Build a high-speed rail system from Fresno to the Bay Area and weave the tech industry into a new community.That\u2019s just a start. Our elite private schools have become enamored with satellite campuses, but they\u2019re mostly fond of the checks autocratic regimes are willing to write to wrap themselves in the comfortable blanket of academic credibility. Building a satellite campus in Abu Dhabi (my employer\u2019s innovation) is arbitraging the brand, not expanding the franchise. Same goes for most executive education, where a mid-level manager gets her company to pay $30,000 for six days across two on-campus \u201Cimmersions\u201D during a \u201Cmulti-modal\u201D experience so she can post a Chief Digital Officer certification from Kellogg\/Penn\/Columbia on her LinkedIn profile. Big Ed(ucation) is beginning to make Big Tech seem noble.The elite should be building campuses in places that would welcome the investment instead of filing lawsuits \u2014 cities such as Albuquerque, Cleveland, Tulsa, etc. This would diversify the elite\u2019s currently cloistered experience, worldview, and politics. Meanwhile, doubling a city\u2019s degree production increases local human capital levels by 7%. Household incomes in college towns are 7.4% higher than in noncollege towns. Jesus, what could a second MIT do for Mississippi?I wrote in New York magazine in 2020 that the truly elite universities would leverage their brand equity and technology to scale and consolidate the market. I could not have been more wrong. A rejectionist, Hermès-style positioning is their drug of choice, and they are speedballing the sleet.Lean into the online-hybrid model. We tried this during Covid, and it worked \u2026 sort of. The missing ingredient from college in 2020 was socialization. But there\u2019s no reason to believe that would disappear if we moved classes online. In 2011, 87% of college students lived off campus, and that didn\u2019t stop them from going to bars, dating, and forming special-interest groups. Nineteen-year-olds aren\u2019t good at much, but they\u2019re great at getting their hearts broken, getting drunk and high, and having unprotected sex \u2026 at scale. Life finds a way. We tend to speak in binary terms: traditional experience or all online. It will be a mix. If we took 33% of our classes online (and we can), we could increase capacity by 50%. But this can\u2019t be an afterthought or an emergency measure \u2014 distance education done well requires investment and new skills.Here\u2019s a pedestrian fix: Go the way of Dartmouth \u2014 quarterly.Most college campuses sit near-empty for three months a year, an egregious waste of capital investment. But Dartmouth\u2019s quarterly calendar means undergraduate classes continue throughout the summer. This makes sense; summer vacation is a relic we inherited from previous generations whose buildings didn\u2019t have AC and who needed their kids to come home to work on the family farm.A key to increasing seats may be to transfer the costs of college from students to corporations. The average cost of hiring an employee is $4,000. Why not lump those recruiting costs into a subsidy partnership with a university and provide early access to young talent? This would let talent-hungry companies build a pipeline from campus to HQ. Transfer the costs and burdens of career centers to the companies that benefit from them.Some companies are already doing it: Starbucks started teaming up with Arizona State University in 2015 \u2014 its applicant pool increased by more than half a million, and 63% of new hires expressed interest in the partnership.Could we put higher ed on the blockchain? Could a university rethink its relationship with the community and tie access to a token? Something like this: Stanford mints 100,000 tokens and auctions them to the public. Each Cardinal Coin gives the bearer unique access to the Stanford community: a vote on major policy changes, entrance to sporting and cultural events, and a seat in any Stanford degree-granting program (subject to minimum standards). Every January 1, another 3,000 coins \u2014 no more \u2014 are minted and sold at auction. Say, the first trade of the coin offering is at $1 million to $10 million a coin. If you have two kids, you\u2019re looking at savings of nearly $500,000 in tuition alone, and the access would create a bidding war for a store of value that would also attract speculative investors.What would guaranteed admission, tuition, alumni events, community access, etc. be worth? Let\u2019s be conservative and peg the value at the lower end, $1 million per coin. This translates to $100 billion in new capital, with another $3 billion in revenue coming in every year thereafter. That quadruples the endowment, increases investment income, and lowers costs (admissions and development departments would no longer be needed). Unrivaled capital to open satellite campuses, invest in the next generation of distance learning tech, or just build more dorms.Would this turn Stanford into the exclusive preserve of the wealthy? Elite universities already are. The wealthy game the system with multimillion-dollar donations (aka the Kushner Krush) or try to bribe someone (Aunt Becky). The Cardinal Coin, putting this all out in the open, could facilitate diversity and merit-based aid. Philanthropists could (will) purchase coins and assign the rights associated with them however they choose \u2014 to kids from low-income households with strong academic achievement, or to unremarkable kids raised by single mothers who show promise but could never get into a school that now only admits 9% of applicants, vs. 74% when I applied. #GoBruins.This was a suggestion from Stig Leschly.Any naval personnel meeting basic requirements can show up to SEAL tryouts, but the program starts tough and gets tougher \u2014 admissions by attrition.What if an elite university had an adjunct campus that implemented the academic equivalent of SEAL training? No admissions department \u2014 whoever makes it through the first semester is admitted. Wouldn\u2019t this also create fierce, resilient, strong capitalist warriors? Warriors chosen for their skills, strength, and grit vs. who their parents are?The tip of the spear for America, higher education, has become markedly less American over the past several decades. We need massive investment and a rejection of the rejectionist and scarcity mindset to return higher ed to its rightful place as an upward lubricant for kids whose parents aren\u2019t rich and who haven\u2019t peaked at 17. We also need to expect more from university leaders, who\u2019ve had little incentive to innovate or rock the boat. Technology is not the key element for the requisite innovation; class traitors are. Deans and chancellors who push back on faculty and alumni and the dangerous notion that we are luxury brands, not public servants.Also, Berkeley homeowners, stop it. Just stop it.Life is so rich,P.S. I started Section4 to give people greater access to business education and the network that comes with it. We\u2019ve got plans to expand that access even further \u2014 look out for big news from us next week.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*gtg_4eW4EC5XRwts.png","author":"Scott Galloway","title":"Six Ideas to Rescue Higher Education","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/marker\/six-ideas-to-rescue-higher-education-fb44f578270b","tags":[]},{"summary":"As we see more and more exploits coming from the developer operations side of security, we need to start addressing this issue head-on\u2026","date":"May 1, 2024","post_content":"In the last ~30 days (since I started writing this), rekt.news has reported on three exploits in Web3, with smart contract developer operations (a.k.a. \u201CDevOps\u201D) being the categorized issue.With many more happening historically.We can determine a common pattern in these exploits by looking into each issue.Note: I\u2019m simplifying complex attacks and am not placing fault anywhere on doing\/not doing something. However, we need to use every exploit in web3 as a chance for us to improve, and the way to do that is to implement new standards on how security is to be done in web3.This smart contract could be exploited by a private key leak because of two true scenarios.Ownable and Upgradeable smart contracts have been controversial for some time, but we will not address that in this post. If you do choose to have an Ownable or Upgradeable smart contract, you need to make sure you take measures in case one of your private keys is leaked.The issue here was with the developer operations (DevOps) of the protocol.This could have been prevented if the contract owner had been a 2 of 3 multi-sig. Having the deploy script automatically transfer ownership to the multi-sig would have been easy to add and verify.This exploit, in particular, happened where the codebase had zero security reviews (as far as I know) and could have helped prevent this, too.This next attack had a similar scenario, except that the key wasn\u2019t leaked, but instead, a rouge employee had access to the smart contract and manipulated it for their gain. This, again, was on a smart contract that was:One might argue that the real issue here was the rouge employee. This might be true, but there are ways to mitigate even this scenario.Unlike our first exploit, this did undergo an audit (password: \u201CESMunc@24!\u201D), and they called out the traditional \u201CCentralized Risk for Trusted Owners\u201D issue. However, this issue is ignored by almost every protocol on every audit.The issue here was with the developer operations (DevOps) of the protocol.If, in addition, this contract had the deploy script in scope, the security team could have verified that the contract\u2019s ownership was going to be transferred immediately to a multi-sig, which could have potentially prevented this attack. If the rouge employee had only 1 of the many keys, then this attack could still have been prevented. The auditor on this codebase could have very well told this protocol not to use an EOA for the owner of the contract, but since the deploy script isn\u2019t in scope, it doesn\u2019t show up on the audit report.Of course, doing due diligence on the employee would have helped here, too. But a much easier solution would have been to add the transfer of ownership to being in-scope on the audit report.The last attack here had nothing to do with private keys leaking but, instead, with an upgrade that introduced a vulnerability. The codebase had been previously audited; however, no such security review had been done on the upgrade itself.The upgrade introduced an issue, and boom, attacks ensued.The issue here was with the developer operations (DevOps) of the protocol.Additionally, we take the time to go through deployment and upgrade scripts on a number of Cyfrin audits even when they are out of scope. Doing so, on more than one occasion, has led us to issues with the codebase or the protocol\u2019s understanding of where attack vectors are and required their deployment scripts to be modified.On a personal note, any time I see someone firing their smart contract into production without testing their deployments, it feels like they are putting a blindfold on, screaming \u201CYOLO,\u201D and praying to whatever deity they believe in that the deployment \u201Cjust works\u201D. This is unacceptable for web3 to continue and scale. Which is why I chose the thumbnail as seen here:And finally, we\u2019ve seen maliciousFor some time, we\u2019ve taught on Cyfrin Updraft that codebases should always include their deploy scripts in their test suite, but we think we need the Web3 security community to introduce a few new standards into our audit practice (if you\u2019re not already following this).These three additions to all security reviews and a protocol\u2019s security checklist will help prevent these in the future. Moving forward, all protocols and security researchers should add these checks to their process, including competitive audits.Let me now get ahead of some rebuttals to adding these checks.\u201CBut Patrick, we don\u2019t need this because\u2026.\u201DAt this point in Web3, there is a good chance that you can take every precaution and still get hacked. If you accept this scenario, then you need to be able to have contingency plans in place for when that happens. Most protocols have some emergency powers, such as the Compound Pause Guardian.If a single simple-to-implement solution can address a wide range of downstream issues, then we should absolutely implement it.Convince them. You can use the three examples above or any other hacks that have come from private key leaks or botched scripting.You\u2019ll need to stop doing that.Go to Cyfrin Updraft and finish the \u201CAdvanced Foundry\u201D curriculum, we teach you how to do this.To learn smart contract security and development, visit Cyfrin UpdraftTo request security support\/security review for your smart contract project visit Cyfrin.io or CodeHawks.com.To learn more about top reported attacks in smart contracts, be sure to study up on Solodit.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*_0nt2O3Cc0_kL4zrlsYpTg.png","author":"Patrick Collins","title":"Deploy scripts are now in scope for smart contract audits","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/cyfrin\/deploy-scripts-are-now-in-scope-for-smart-contract-audits-7fbb95788ce7","tags":["Smart Contract Security","Smart Contract Auditing","Blockchain","Cybersecurity","Smart Contracts"]},{"summary":"MagApe\u2019s product roadmap serves as the guiding force behind our initiatives, steering us towards the ever-evolving landscape of gaming\u2026","date":null,"post_content":"MagApe\u2019s product roadmap serves as the guiding force behind our initiatives, steering us towards the ever-evolving landscape of gaming.

Because of the logic of the blockchain, every transaction is public. If you have some ETH on your account, you cannot transfer it anonymously, because anybody can follow your transaction history on the blockchain. Coin mixers, like Tornado Cash, can solve this privacy problem by breaking the on-chain link between the source and the destination address by using ZKP.If you want to anonymize one of your transactions, you have to deposit a small amount of ETH (or ERC20 token) on the Tornado Cash contract (ex.: 1 ETH). After a little while, you can withdraw this 1 ETH with a different account. The trick is that nobody can create a link between the depositor account and the withdrawal account. If hundreds of accounts deposit 1 ETH on one side and the other hundreds of accounts withdraw 1 ETH on the other side, then nobody will be able to follow the path where the money moves. The technical challenge is that smart contract transactions are also public like any other transaction on the Ethereum network. This is the point where ZKP will be relevant.When you deposit your 1 ETH on the contract, you have to provide a \u201Ccommitment\u201D. This commitment is stored by the smart contract. When you withdraw 1 ETH on the other side, you have to provide a \u201Cnullifier\u201D and a zero-knowledge proof. The nullifier is a unique ID that is in connection with the commitment and the ZKP proves the connection, but nobody knows which nullifier is assigned to which commitment (except the owner of the depositor\/withdrawal account).Again: We can prove that one of the commitments is assigned to our nullifier, without revealing our commitment.The nullifiers are tracked by the smart contract, so we can withdraw only one deposited ETH with one nullifier.Sounds easy? It\u2019s not! :) Let\u2019s go deep inside the technology. But before anything, we have to understand another tricky thing, the Merkle tree.Merkle trees are hash trees, where the leaves are the elements, and every node is a hash of the child nodes. The root of the tree is the Merkle root, which represents the whole set of elements. If you add, remove, or change any element (leaf) in the tree, the Merkle root will change. The Merkle root is a unique identifier of the set of elements. But how can we use it?There is another thing called Merkle proof. If I have a Merkle root, you can send me a Merkle proof that proves that an element is in the set that is represented by the root. The figure below shows how is it working. If you want to prove to me that HK is in the set, you have to send me the HL, HIJ, HMNOP, and HABCDEFGH hashes. Using these hashes I can calculate the Merkle root. If the root is the same as my root then HK is in the set. Where can we use it?A simple example is whitelisting. Imagine a smart contract that has a method that can be called by only whitelisted users. The problem is that there are 1000 whitelisted accounts. How can you store them on the smart contract? The simple way is to store every account in mapping, but it is very expensive. A cheaper solution is building a Merkle tree, and storing the Merkle root only (1 hash vs 1000 is not bad). If somebody wants to call the method she has to give a Merkle proof (in this case it is a list of 10 hashes) that can be easily validated by the smart contract.Again: A Merkle tree is used to represent a set of elements with one hash (the Merkle root). The existence of an element can be proven by the Merkle proof.The next thing that we have to understand is the zero-knowledge proof itself. With ZKP, you can prove that you know something without revealing the thing that you know. For generating a ZKP, you need a circuit. A circuit is something like a small program that has public inputs and outputs, and private inputs. These private inputs are the knowledge that you don\u2019t reveal for the verification, this is why it is called zero-knowledge proof. With ZKP, we can prove that the output can be generated from the inputs with the given circuit.A simple circuit looks like this:Using this circuit, we can prove that we know the source of the given hash. This circuit has one input (the nullifier) and one output (the nullifier hash). The default accessibility of the inputs is private, and the outputs are always public. This circuit uses 2 libraries from the Circomlib. Circomlib is a set of useful circuits. The first library is bitlify that contains bit manipulation methods, and the second is pedersen which contains the Pedersen hasher. Pedersen hashing is a hashing method that can be run efficiently in ZKP circuits. In the body of the Main template, we fill the hasher and calculate the hash. (For more info about the circom language, please take a look at the circom documentation)For generating the zero-knowledge proof, you will need a proving key. This is the most sensitive part of ZKP because using the source data that is used to generate the proving key, anybody could generate fake proofs. This source data is called the \u201Ctoxic waste\u201D that has to be dropped. Because of this, there is a \u201Cceremony\u201D for generating the proving key. The ceremony has many members and every member contribute to the proving key. Only one non-malicious member is enough to generate a valid proving key. Using the private inputs, the public inputs, and the proving key, the ZKP system can run the circuit and generate the Proof and the outputs.There is a validation key for the proving key that can be used for the validation. The validation system uses the public inputs, the outputs, and the validation key to validate the proof.Snarkjs is a full-featured tool to generate the proving key and the verification key by the ceremony, generate the proof, and validate it. It can also generate a smart contract for the verification, that can be used by any other contract to validate the zero-knowledge proof. For more information, please look at the snarkjs documentation.Now, we have everything to understand how Tornado Cash (TC) works. When you deposit 1 ETH on the TC contract, you have to provide a commitment hash. This commitment hash will be stored in a Merkle tree. When you withdraw this 1 ETH with a different account, you have to provide 2 zero-knowledge proofs. The first proves that the Merkel tree contains your commitment. This proof is a zero-knowledge proof of a Merkle proof. But this is not enough, because you should be allowed to withdraw this 1 ETH only once. Because of this, you have to provide a nullifier that is unique for the commitment. The contract stores this nullifier, this ensures that you don\u2019t be able to withdraw the deposited money more than one time.The uniqueness of the nullifier is ensured by the commitment generation method. The commitment is generated from the nullifier and a secret by hashing. If you change the nullifier then the commitment will change, so one nullifier can be used for only one commitment. Because of the one-way nature of hashing, it\u2019s not possible to link the commitment and the nullifier, but we can generate a ZKP for it.After the theory, let\u2019s see how the withdraw circuit of TC looks like:The first template is the CommitmentHasher. It has two inputs, the nullifier and the secret which are two random 248-bit numbers. The template calculates the nullifier hash and the commitment hash which is a hash of the nullifier and the secret as I wrote before.The second template is the Withdraw itself. It has 2 public inputs, the Merkle root, and the nullifierHash. The Merkle root is needed to verify the Merkle proof, and the nullifierHash is needed by the smart contract to store it. The private input parameters are the nullifier, the secret, and the pathElements and pathIndices of the Merkle proof. The circuit checks the nullifier by generating the commitment from it and from the secret and also checks the given Merkle proof. If everything is fine, the zero-knowledge proof will be generated that can be validated by the TC smart contract.You can find the smart contracts in the contracts folder in the repo.

Amidst our exploration of diverse solutions, we established connections with developers who quickly recognized the potential of our technology. It was through these collaborations that we found ourselves presented with a unique opportunity: the chance to develop Web3 games leveraging the renowned Ragnarok IP.Viewing this opportunity as both a challenge and a fresh avenue for innovation, we eagerly embraced the task at hand. With our expertise in blockchain solutions as our foundation, we set out to craft groundbreaking games that would push the boundaries of the market.Numerous blockchain games have entered the market fray, yet those exclusively targeting Web3 audiences have faltered in gathering a sizable user base, hampered by the limited number of Web3 gamers. On the other hand, Web 2.5 games have struggled to cater to the distinct needs of both Web2 and Web3 users, often falling short of capturing either demographic effectively. Our observation led us to a fundamental belief: the success of blockchain games hinges on their ability to cater to the diverse requirements of both Web2 and Web3 users.Reflecting on the existing gaming landscape, we identified a critical gap \u2014 a lack of cohesion between the needs of gamers and investors. Our analysis led us to a stark realization: \u201CGamers don\u2019t invest, investors don\u2019t play the game.\u201D While Web2 players seek a gaming experience devoid of heavy investment commitments, Web3 investors prioritize their financial endeavors, acknowledging the potential for substantial returns when coupled with active gameplay participation. Recognizing the symbiotic relationship between gamers and investors, we concluded that a thriving ecosystem must bridge this divide, offering a seamless connection between the two groups.With this insight in mind, our mission was to cultivate an ecosystem that addresses the needs of both gamers and investors while fostering collaboration and mutual benefit. Our vision is clear: to build a dynamic environment where players and investors converge, enriching the gaming experience and unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation.Set with a clear objective, our strategy crystallized into three key pillars:1. Harnessing the Power of Ragnarok IP:Fortunately, the Ragnarok IP boasts a steadfast fanbase, ensuring our ability to draw in existing enthusiasts and establish an initial player base. To deepen engagement with these fans, we opted to preserve the distinctive ambiance of Ragnarok within our game, fostering a sense of nostalgia and familiarity. At the heart of our game lie the iconic Ragnarok monsters \u2014 Ragmons, carefully chosen as the focal characters due to their diverse designs and undeniable appeal. We recognized the potential of these creatures to thrive in the realm of NFT gaming, inspiring users to embark on a quest to collect them all.Moreover, the charm and charisma exuded by the multitude of Ragnarok monsters, honed over years within the Ragnarok IP, resonate with both new and existing fans alike. This appeal extends beyond aesthetics, as we sought to integrate core elements from the original Ragnarok IP, including its class system, into our game. By infusing user characters with distinct appearances and abilities, we aim to captivate new players while evoking fond memories for seasoned enthusiasts.2. Pioneering Web3 Integration:The fervent following of the Ragnarok universe is undeniable. Enthusiasts of all stripes, drawn to its rich lore and captivating world, eagerly explore new iterations of the Ragnarok IP, transcending genre boundaries. Harnessing the power of this dedicated fanbase, we are poised to leverage the Ragnarok IP in multifaceted ways, capturing the attention of existing devotees from the outset.As user pool is acquired, game\u2019s ecosystem expands which eventually leads to the possibility of increase in token value \u2014 a testament to the symbiotic relationship between user base and investment potential. Recognizing that success in the gaming realm hinges on a robust and engaged community, we sought to forge a deeper connection between gamers and investors. To achieve this, we devised a novel approach: empowering high community involved investors with the option to join DAO.The Ragnarok: Monster World DAO serves as the foundational element of Ragmon\u2019s governance structure, overseeing its various facets. This collaborative endeavor not only enhances user engagement but also fosters a dynamic exchange of ideas, enriching the gaming experience for all involved. With investors directly contributing to the creation of richer content, the value of the token and the success of their investment stand to flourish.3. Bridging the Divide:Our efforts don\u2019t halt in flourishing each side of users; we endeavor to bridge the gap between disparate user groups, enabling investors to embrace gaming and gamers to delve into investment opportunities. By facilitating the seamless transition from player to investor and vice versa, we aimed to amplify both the enjoyment and rewards experienced by all.The crux of our vision lies in enabling users of varying backgrounds and preferences to appreciate each other\u2019s contributions, thereby multiplying their collective rewards. For gamers, the allure of wielding Ragmon NFTs, capable of tipping the scales in battle serves as a potent incentive. As their desire for these exclusive assets grows, so too does their inclination to invest in on-chain Ragnarok NFTs, thus embarking on their journey on Web3 as investors.To further democratize users access to the Web3 realm, we adjusted pricing structures to favor token usage over traditional payment option. This strategic move ensures that participating in Web3 gaming remains financially viable for all, fostering inclusivity and accessibility.From the investor\u2019s standpoint, leveraging powerful NFTs acquired through investment endeavors not only bolsters their chances of victory but also augments their potential rewards. This synergy between investment and gameplay incentivizes investors to actively engage in the gaming experience, ultimately fostering a deeper connection with the platform.Given our primary strategy of tapping into the passionate Ragnarok IP fanbase to establish a robust user base, we strategically focused our efforts on regions where the IP enjoys immense popularity. Currently, Southeast Asia stands out as the epicenter of Ragnarok fandom, boasting a plethora of themed events and merchandise industries. It was evident that Southeast Asia held immense potential as our primary target market.In light of this, we made a deliberate choice to adopt Ronin as our mainnet. Renowned for its specialization in gaming and its sizable user pool, onboarding on Ronin was ideal. Moreover, Ronin\u2019s deep understanding of Blockchain users and its established presence in the Southeast Asia region ensured a seamless onboarding process for our target audience. By harnessing the synergy between the Ragnarok IP\u2019s stronghold in Southeast Asia and Ronin\u2019s expertise, resources, and user base, we positioned ourselves optimally to engage with our key demographic.To captivate and retain users, our game needed to strike a delicate balance: it had to be approachable yet challenging, embodying the ethos of \u201Ceasy to learn, hard to master.\u201D Embracing this mantra, we set out to create an experience that would appeal to a broad audience while offering depth and longevity.Drawing inspiration from the tower defense and RTS genres, we crafted a gameplay experience designed to engage both casual players and seasoned strategists. Tower defense games, known for their accessible mechanics, provided a solid foundation. However, we infused our game with unique elements to elevate the experience, ensuring it remained fresh and captivating.At its core, our game tasks players with assembling teams of Ragnarok monsters \u2014 Ragmons to defend their towers while launching assaults on enemy strongholds. Yet, we introduced innovative twists, such as the ability for players\u2019 characters to join the fray alongside their Ragmon companions. These additions add layers of strategy, inviting players to think critically and adapt their tactics. Additionally, each season brings new challenges, with the stats of each monster undergoing adjustments. This dynamic environment encourages players to continuously refine their strategies, ensuring that mastery is an ongoing journey rather than a destination.In the PvP battle mode, players must contend with ever-changing opponents, requiring adaptability and strategic foresight. Assembling a diverse team of Ragmons becomes crucial, as each adversary demands a tailored approach. This strategic depth not only enhances gameplay but also fuels players\u2019 desire to collect and cultivate their roster of Ragmons, aligning perfectly with the principles of NFT gaming.Furthermore, we are committed to expanding the game\u2019s content with diverse modes such as guild battles and raids, drawing upon the foundations of tower defense and RTS gameplay. These additions promise a wealth of new experiences for players to explore, ensuring that each season brings fresh challenges and opportunities for engagement.Looking Ahead: A Future of Boundless PossibilitiesAs we embark on this transformative journey, our commitment remains unwavering. We strive not only to create a game but to cultivate a thriving ecosystem where innovation knows no bounds. With each step forward, we inch closer to our vision of a barrier-free gaming utopia, where gamers and investors unite in a shared pursuit of adventure and reward.In closing, we invite you to join us on this extraordinary voyage. Together, let\u2019s make the future of gaming together, one block at a time.X ⎹ Facebook ⎹ Youtube ⎹ Discord","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*n8feALE8ZKwrqGcUojT8jw.png","author":"Zero X And","title":"Journey to Ragnarok: Monster World","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/ragnarok-monster-world\/journey-to-ragnarok-monster-world-866b90b19b22","tags":["Blockchain","Games"]},{"summary":"The topic of the day: how to lose all of your hair in the span of 2 months, also known as how to render a 2D image of a 3D Zoku in real\u2026","date":null,"post_content":"Hello again,EKCO here, co-founder of Miinded, and lead developer.Welcome to another episode of the ChainZoku Deep Dive. This is Episode 3, following up on Episode 1 \u2014 How it started and Episode 2\u2014 Meet the Zokus. The topic of the day: how to lose all of your hair in the span of 2 months, also known as how to render a 2D image of a 3D Zoku in real time.As a starter, if you haven\u2019t already, you should take 5 minutes to read the extremely well-done Guide to ChainZoku, which will cover the basics of the project.To make this article a bit more interesting, I\u2019ve decided to interview myself using the questions we asked ourselves throughout the development process, and the answers we found.I\u2019m probably not teaching you anything by saying that for an NFT to be considered as such (and visible on Marketplaces), it must be represented by a single image (PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF). On top of that, it can also contain additional media in any format (video, HTML, image, text, etc.).With Zokus being customizable and evolving NFTs, a major challenge for us has been to find a way to generate a 2D image of each Zoku image as quickly as possible, whenever the user decides to add or remove a piece of gear.At Miinded, we\u2019re no strangers to real-time 2D image generation. We\u2019ve been experimenting with it for several years on our Cryptofoxes project.But we like to push the cursors to the max.Nope! In the case of a 2D customization project, we use a stack of PNG images representing the various traits of the NFT. The images are added one on top of the other in a very precise order to create a complete image.In 3D, this is not optimal! Because with the same process, there would be problems with shadows, highlights, superimposed elements and overall ugly rendering.To make a 2D image, it\u2019s \u201Ceasy\u201D: you open Paint, make 2\u20133 doodles, save as a PNG and you\u2019ve got something, ugly of course, but you\u2019ve got something.In 3D, you don\u2019t open Paint, you open Blender, Cinema 4D, 3DsMax, Maya and so on. These are all software programs with their own structures and varying degrees of functionality, and they\u2019re very complex to get to grips with, even when it comes to making ugly things.The ChainZoku team has an excellent \u2014 I\u2019d even go as far as say one of the best 3D designers around. He works in multiple different softwares, such as Zbrush (sculpting), Substance Painter (texturing), Marvelous Designer (clothing simulation), and uses Blender to put everything together to create the final render.Perfect, Blender has a Python API that allows all those developers who want to lose their hair to drive the software with code. LFG!!Not at all, each Zoku corresponds to a succession of Assets (cf: episode 2 \u2014 The Zokus). So to create our Zoku, we need to create each Asset independently, in 3D.It\u2019s like 2D, but instead of having a stack of PNGs, we have a stack of 3D Assets. When you put it like that, it sounds so simple\u2026 But guess what? It absolutely isn\u2019t.A 3D Object is 1 structure (Mesh), 3 images (1 texture, 1 normal map, 1 albedo), and the \u201Cstuff\u201D that connects it all together.The 3D Object is stored in a Blender file that can only be read by Blender software.Each 3D Object must be placed in a 3-dimensional space represented by the X (horizontal), Y (vertical) and Z (depth) axes. Placement must be very precise, as the slightest deviation would be obvious. But we have a very large number of 3D objects to manage, all with very different placements. On top of that, we have to communicate with the 3D Artist to know every position of every 3D object\u2026 There\u2019s too great a risk of error in the long run.We\u2019ve opted for a simpler approach: everything in the same Blender file! That way, the 3D Artist places the 3D Objects exactly where he wants, and we just have to read the positions. Simple enough, right?Yet again, every simple solution has its limits: Blender file size.ChainZoku at launch (it has kept growing ever since) has over 400 meshes and more than 1000 textures, representing 65GB of raw data. We have good PCs, but not yet at the level of NASA.We had to divide the 3D Objects into different Blender files to reduce the weight of the Blender file while maintaining the correct positions of the 3D Objects.By the time of launch, we had 7 Blender files of around 10 GB each, which is heavy but still manageable.We created new ones post-launch in order to accommodate for new items being added.Now that we\u2019ve got our 3D Objects well positioned in our Blender files, we can create the 2D image matching our magnificent Zoku.To achieve this, we\u2019ve created another blank Blender file containing only the pre-configured lights, imported the 3D Objects corresponding to the Zoku Assets one by one, and rendered the image via a Python script executed by Blender.It\u2019s as if a human launched Blender, imported the 3D Objects manually and clicked on \u201CRender\u201D, but here it\u2019s done via code automatically.We do this 2 times per Zoku, once for the main image, and a second time for the Portrait image.The 2 images are then uploaded to our servers, compressed, cached in our CDN and finally made publicly available.The whole process from rendering to upload takes about 1min, a respectable score.Originally, we wanted to have rendering times of less than 10 seconds \u2014 which is technically possible to reach, but given the cost of render farms and servers, we decided not to.Currently, rendering is done by a server specialized in 3D rendering. It has a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3070) hosted in a datacenter in Paris. We developed a bespoke code and server interface in order to keep costs as low as possible. As of today, the server has already done 5,035 customizations \u2014 on top of having rendered every single original Zoku.I\u2019ll go into more detail on how our render farm works in a future article \u2014 it took us weeks or R&D!You may think that all this sounds easy and logical, but to get to this point, there have been many meetings, tests and accelerated hair loss\u2026In the next article, I\u2019ll tell you about OpenSea\u2019s real-time 3D viewer, which was a big thorn in my side tooSee you in the next one!EKCO-Every simple solution has its limits-About MiindedMiinded is a French-based multi-disciplinary web3 studio founded in 2021.

Traditional verification mechanisms often struggle to balance efficiency with robust security, especially in systems that handle complex transactions or data analyses. We introduce Proof of Sampling (PoSP), a sampling based verification protocol, a groundbreaking solution designed to address these challenges head-on.PoSP introduces a novel approach to verification that leverages sampling techniques to ensure high security without compromising system performance. By utilizing a game-theoretic model known as pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, PoSP encourages all participants to act honestly, enhancing the network\u2019s overall trustworthiness and reliability. This protocol is not just theoretical \u2014 it has practical applications ranging from decentralized AI inference to improving blockchain layer 2 solutions, and extending further to enhancing the design of Actively Validated Services (AVS) in EigenLayer, making it a significant advancement in blockchain technology.Have you ever wondered how public transport authorities ensure everyone pays their fare, even though ticket inspectors seem to appear so infrequently? Consider the Swiss bus system, where instead of checking every passenger\u2019s ticket on every trip, inspectors conduct random checks. This might raise a question: wouldn\u2019t people take chances if inspections are rare? Interestingly, the answer is no. Here\u2019s why: the random nature of inspections, coupled with the fines for fare evasion, sets up a scenario where the most rational, or optimal, strategy for each passenger is simply to buy a ticket.Let\u2019s delve into the numbers for a moment. In Zurich, for a local zone trip, the price of a second class adult ticket for a half-hour validity is CHF 2.80. The penalty for being caught first time without a ticket is CHF 102.80. Suppose the probability of a ticket being checked on any given journey is 10%. Under these conditions, if a passenger decides to risk not buying a ticket, the expected cost (the penalty multiplied by the probability of getting caught) would be CHF 10.28 (10% of CHF 102.80), which is more than the ticket price. Therefore, economically and logically, buying a ticket is the most sensible option \u2014 the fines make evasion unattractive and compliance the best strategy.In a similar vein, the PoSP harnesses these principles within decentralized blockchain networks. Instead of verifying every single transaction or data interaction \u2014 which would be tremendously taxing on the system \u2014 PoSP uses a sampling method. Transactions are randomly selected and verified, drastically reducing the workload and computational demand. Here\u2019s the clever part: the design of the protocol ensures that acting honestly is the most beneficial strategy for all participants, thanks to a game-theoretical concept called the pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. Under this equilibrium, any deviation towards dishonesty becomes less attractive compared to the rewards of maintaining integrity.So, how does this innovative approach reshape the security and efficiency of decentralized systems? As we dive deeper into the mechanics of PoSP, we\u2019ll see how this protocol not only bolsters network integrity but also aligns seamlessly with the fundamental needs for scalability and efficiency in modern blockchain applications.In the ever-evolving world of decentralized system, imagine each node in the network as a participant in a high-stakes game show. Here, accuracy and honesty aren\u2019t just valued; they\u2019re required for the game to continue smoothly. Enter PoSP, a brilliant protocol that ensures every player adheres to the rules in a way that allows each participant to maximize their own utility, without the need for constant oversight from everyone else. It\u2019s like having an invisible referee who occasionally steps in to make sure everything\u2019s on track.Initial Move. The game begins with one node, known as the asserter, who claims to have computed a given function that helps maintain the ledger\u2019s integrity. But instead of shouting out the solution for all to hear, they seal it in a metaphorical envelope \u2014 a cryptographic commitment. This envelope proves they\u2019ve done their homework but keeps the actual answers hidden. It\u2019s then sent off to the orchestrator, who holds the central role of overseeing the fairness of the game. In real application, the orchestrator could be a Layer 1 blockchain.Random Check. The orchestrator, equipped with a virtual coin, decides whether to trust the asserter outright or to verify the claim further. This decision is random but calculated, ensuring every play is fair but not overly burdensome. If luck is on the asserter\u2019s side, they get rewarded right away for their efforts, and the game moves on.Initiate Challenges. If the coin flip goes the other way, the orchestrator calls in a select few from the network, known as validators. These validators are like detectives, each working independently to solve the same puzzle as the asserter. They, too, seal their answers in their unique envelopes, which are then collected for examination.Accept vs. Arbitration. As the orchestrator gathers these sealed answers, a moment of tension ensues. If all the envelopes match, it confirms that the puzzle was solved correctly by everyone, and the asserter, along with the validators, shares the reward. However, if there\u2019s a mismatch, it triggers a detective-like review process where each solution is scrutinized. Honest nodes are rewarded for their accuracy, while any node that tries to cheat the system faces penalties.This approach leverages the collective power of the network to self-validate its computations efficiently. Under specific conditions, this PoSP achieves what is known in game theory as a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. It\u2019s a state where all participants in the network are incentivized to act honestly because any other strategy would be less beneficial. In other words, when the system is set up correctly, with rewards and penalties balanced against the probability of being challenged, the most rational and profitable approach for all nodes is to compute the result accurately.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*Q4UKna6CNWAjimRQ","author":"Hyperbolic","title":"Proof of Sampling (PoSP) Breakdown","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/hyperbolic-labs\/proof-of-sampling-posp-breakdown-23b6fa98cd01","tags":["Decentralized Ai","AI","Blockchain","Web3"]},{"summary":"What the origin story of the Reformation tells us about the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.","date":"Feb 8, 2022","post_content":"500 years ago the world was forever changed by a bad review.On October 31st, 1517, a plump, anxious friar and theology professor named Martin Luther nailed a list of complaints \u2014 his 95 theses \u2014 to the door of a monastery in Wittenburg. Luther was vicious, thorough, and attacked just about every aspect of Roman Catholic doctrine. He hated the new taxes anytime a new bishop was elected, the absurd yearly mass for the dead, the endless pilgrimages. But he saved special venom for indulgences.The indulgences were medieval pay-to-play, a way for the naughty to offset their peccadillos with a payment to the church. Covet your neighbor\u2019s wife? Eat too many eel pies on Easter Sunday? Give a bag of silver or gold to your local bishop and you too could still walk through those pearly gates. For Luther it was a step too far \u2014 a greedy, cynical ploy by the Church that implied humans could haggle with God. It was widely hated, and when someone finally had the gall \u2014 or stupidity \u2014 to complain about it, people listened. Including, of course, the authorities.In 1521, Luther was called by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to recant at a formal papal assembly, or \u201CDiet,\u201D in the city of Worms. Luther was a small-time friar, used to woolen frocks and mutton sausages, untrained in the pomp and majesty of the court. But though he may have looked modest, Luther had a powerful weapon on his side \u2014 popularity.In the four years since Wittenburg, Luther had been a content machine, publishing almost 25 books, pamphlets, and religious tracts. His words made him a folk hero, the voice of a new religious movement that dared to defy the Catholic church. He had taken the printing press and weaponized it. And the threat this new technology posed to the iron grip of the Church was immense.For almost a thousand years the Catholic Church had been the center of medieval religious, economic, and social life, a kind of supramanager of the feudal order. It maintained that order through a vast set of rituals \u2014 attending Latin mass, making a pilgrimage to the bones of a saint \u2014 that publicly affirmed the power of the Church. God lived \u2014 quite literally in the eucharist \u2014 in the social body.But since the 14th century, major changes had destabilized the feudal order and the legitimacy of the church. The first major blow came with the arrival of the Black Death in 1349. By killing off half the population of Europe, the plague increased the supply of free land and decreased the supply of laborers, giving them both freedom from \u2014 and bargaining power over \u2014 their feudal lords. Feudal lords\u2019 power further diminished with the discovery of New World markets in the 15th century. Financing expeditions, processing raw materials, and managing credit systems all necessitated an increasingly sophisticated economic system that shifted power away from rural aristocratic lords towards a market economy run by a burgeoning, urban middle class. And then came the printing press.Invented in 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, the printing press was the key technology of the early modern era. During the middle ages, books were hand copied, slow to produce, and prohibitively expensive. Gutenberg\u2019s invention made written material cheap and relatively quick to mass produce. Although literacy was still low, the ability to rapidly spread new ideas through space and time was massively destabilizing to the Church\u2019s thousand-year monopoly on the truth. If the Bible was the Word of God, and I have a copy, then what are the priests for? The revolution was already there, in any banker, journeymen, or cobbler\u2019s hands; all Luther did was articulate it.In this way, the printing press did more than increase access to information, but radically changed the way medieval people imagined the world. There was no need for incense, Hail Marys, or magic spells; God was an idea, whose will could be divined privately by decoding his Words in a book. There was no need for priests or bishops; God\u2019s truth was right there, waiting to be read. The printing press manifested its own theology. The old medieval world \u2014 where Heaven and Earth were unified in the Great Chain of Being \u2014 was suddenly split into new, opposing spheres: Church and State, public and private, body and mind.By nailing up his 95 Theses, Luther was the first to fully publicize this revolutionary shift. And now, at the Diet of Worms, it was time to defend his ideas \u2014 and his life \u2014 before some of the most powerful men on the continent.At the assembly, Luther summed up this movement in two phrases: sola fide, sola scriptura \u2014 by faith and the Word alone. The Bible, not the Church, was the only source of truth and legitimacy. This made all the Church\u2019s intermediaries \u2014 popes, priests, monks \u2014 redundant. Then Luther took it a step further. He claimed (correctly) that the Church\u2019s most sacred rituals \u2014 the eucharist, infant baptism, the cult of the saints \u2014 were pure inventions, with no evidence in scripture. It was all a puppet show used to keep bishops fat off the toil of serfs. To Luther, salvation was a private affair between God and an individual; no matter how much they paid for an indulgence, only God could forgive sins. He asked the court to find anything in the Bible that could refute his claims, a passage that showed that God required them \u2014 the well-fed, silken robed papal authorities seated before him \u2014 or their rituals. It didn\u2019t go over well.The Diet quickly came to a decision. Luther was excommunicated from the Church \u2014 canceled, you might say \u2014 and told he could safely return home. But it was obvious that Luther was a marked man. He was too popular, too outspoken to be allowed to freely roam \u2014 or publish \u2014 in Germany. Before long, Luther would be arrested, sentenced, and executed for heresy. Thankfully, a sympathetic patron, the Elector of Saxony, Prince Fredrick III, staged a mock kidnapping in the woods outside of Worms and brought Luther back to his castle in Wartburg. Luther, probably without even knowing it, was saved from his own martyrdom.For the next two decades, Luther lived the life of a comfortable Influencer \u2014 writing full time and growing fat on ale and gravy-soaked roasts. In 1534, he produced his crowning achievement, the first German translation of the Bible. Now, any Bohemian cobbler or journeyman had unfiltered access to the Word of God.Over the next century, the movement that Luther defined \u2014 Protestantism, after the Latin protestari, \u201Cto publicly testify\u201D \u2014 quickly spread across Europe. And it was more than a religious movement; it was a fundamental restructuring of Western society where the individual would be the center of the State.What came next, so the story goes, was the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, modernity. This eventually culminated in the triumph of the secular, scientifically rational world we live in today. And it all started with Luther, a lone hero whose dogged pursuit of truth, and challenge of the status quo, changed the course of history. Or maybe with the printing press \u2014 that singular technology that broke the intellectual stranglehold of the Catholic Church and helped birth an individualized and abstracted subjectivity. Take your pick; or better yet, combine the two. Because the story of Luther and the printing press is being told everywhere \u2014 on the pages of Wired and The New York Times, on Reddit forums and from TikTok influencers, in Apple ads and tweets from billionaire-entrepreneurs.It\u2019s the story of messianic, techno-solutionism, the belief that advances in science and technology are inherently progressive; that history is not a struggle of social, economic, or environmental forces, but the inevitable triumph of better and better ideas (discovered and then propagated by some charismatic genius). Luther\u2019s story still holds such sway because it is the genesis of this myth, the symbolic moment we stole fire from the gods. Techno-solutionism has become so ingrained, so necessary as a part of our cultural mythos that to deny it \u2014 even when the invention is digital-junk being touted by hucksters looking to make a quick buck \u2014 is to challenge a worldview that is as fervently, and irrationally, believed in as the dogma of the medieval Church of Rome.Five hundred years from the Diet of Worms, we are told we are on the cusp of another revolution. One that promises to eliminate our dependence on the State once for all, to create a utopia where everyone is their own master. It\u2019s a story where everyone is getting hilariously rich, where unicorns drive Lamborghinis (\u201Clambos\u201D) to the moon and an ex-Hollywood child actor creates a $100 billion dollar currency. A journey into the future where everything is transmuted into software \u2014 the State, money, art, your identity.Behold, the blockchain.2008 \u2014 the year of the global financial crisis \u2014 was a good year to start a religion.A decade of cheap credit and a lax regulatory environment had turned the American economy into one giant casino. When the bookie finally came knocking, and no one could pay, central banks like the Federal Reserve conjured trillions of dollars out of thin air, and then promptly gave it back to the same self-dealing, corrupt bankers who had engineered the scam. Most of the public was too shocked or confused to know better. \u201CQuantitative easing,\u201D \u201Cmortgage-backed derivatives\u201D \u2014 these \u201Csolutions\u201D were as arcane and incomprehensible as a medieval Latin mass. But the message was clear: Money was magic, and only we \u2014 the high priests of finance \u2014 know the spells.That year, a mysterious coder named Satoshi Nakamoto proposed an alternative: a digital currency built on a decentralized system that was anonymous, hack-proof, and inflation-proof. There would be no central bank \u2014 new coins would be \u201Cmined\u201D by computers solving complex math problems and then added to a cryptographically secure chain of code. The currency would provide a way for anyone in the world to exchange value free of the oversight of their government. One year later, Nakamoto released the proof of concept \u2014 Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.Unlike Luther, Satoshi\u2019s theses weren\u2019t nailed to a bank\u2019s door, but published in a white paper on an obscure cryptography mailing list, disguised in jargon and mathematics that were only decipherable to the coder-Elect. Soon, a legion of digital apostles formed to follow in Satoshi\u2019s footsteps, creating their own alternative currencies \u2014 or alt-coins \u2014 and get fabulously, stupidly rich off of them.In 2015, a teenager named Vitalik Buterin developed Ethereum, an open-source rival to Bitcoin. (He\u2019s now worth $1.5 billion.) In 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared almost 10,000%, from $900 to $20,000. In 2018, the ex-Mighty Ducks star Pierce Brock co-founded Tether, a \u201Cstablecoin\u201D with a $100 billion dollar market cap. It was alchemy, code became cash, Priuses transmuted into lambos. Prices were going to the moon, and no idea became too stupid to make a buck off.A banana company in Laos created Bannancoin, pegged to the price of one kilo of Lady Fingers. Then there\u2019s Dentacoin, a dentistry token that at one point had a market value of $2 billion. Dogecoin, with a cute little icon of a Shibu Inu as its mascot, started out as a joke \u2014 a memecoin. But after tech prophet Elon Musk tweeted about it, its value skyrocketed. Its current market cap: $18 billion dollars. Clearly, the ability to create billions out of nothing was the sign of a new era. Tether\u2019s other founder put it bluntly: \u201CThis is the first time in human history anyone other than kings or governments or gods can create their own money.\u201D King Solomon was minting his own mines.But, for the true believers the real promise in Satoshi\u2019s paper wasn\u2019t godlike wealth but the blockchain, the system of decentralized, distributed ledgers that Bitcoin is built upon. To put it (not that) simply, the blockchain is a massively shared, simultaneously accessed spreadsheet visible to everyone, but alterable only when certain conditions are met. Blockchain would fulfill the original promise of the Internet, as a free and open system that would disperse power rather than centralize it.The current Internet is a distributed system, where information is stored on servers that are accessed through a central router. This centralization has a lot of benefits \u2014 it\u2019s simple, stable, and resilient \u2014 but there\u2019s one major catch. Anyone who has control over this system has an incredible amount of power. Malicious state or corporate actors can shut down key routers to silence protests, hide bad PR, or even cripple whole economies. The Internet, as it was originally designed, favors the accumulation of power. Which is one reason why four companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon \u2014 completely dominate it.In contrast, the blockchain is a decentralized system, built on peer-to-peer connections. Control is diffused, independent of direct state or corporate control. In a global blockchain system there would be no central node to control, no server farm to take over, just a Great Blockchain of Being \u2014 billions of individuals connected through a web of code. To its true believers, blockchain could redefine property rights, legal systems, and the very idea of a State for the 21st century.Anything that is added to the blockchain stays there \u2014 a digital version of Moses\u2019 golden tablets. Through the use of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, individuals could store virtual property or inscribe their own names on this tablet \u2014 own their digital identity and decide how it would be shared, reproduced, or monetized. NFTs could be used to create a new kind of property that would be legitimized by code, rather than state authority. When combined with smart contracts \u2014 basically self-executing algorithms \u2014 the possibilities are, to the crypto faithful at least, endless.Smart contracts are a way to enforce the terms of an agreement without a middleman. With one swoop, you could replace lawyers, notaries, and bureaucrats with software. Instead of agonizing wait times at the DMV, your Bitcoin linked account could automatically pay \u2014 and guarantee the legitimacy of \u2014 your yearly registration. But, in theory, you could program these smart contracts to do anything \u2014 to replace legal systems, citizenship, even the State. A few brave crypto pioneers have already plunged into the wilderness to try just that.In 2021, Wyoming approved the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) \u2014 blockchain-based entities in which members use crypto-tokens to vote on actions. That year, a group of investors banded together to purchase 100 acres of sagebrush steppe in central Wyoming. (Showing the creative power of consensus, they named it CityDAO.) In the spirit of liberty and freedom, citizenship is open to all. For .25 Ether \u2014 about $1000 \u2014 you can buy \u201Cbasic\u201D citizenship to CityDAO, which includes access to a Discord, voting rights, and the option to settle land (after the first \u201Cfounding citizens,\u201D of course). No word yet on when the next tier of citizenship will be released.To its boosters, CityDAO is proof that blockchain and crypto can transform the world. If a group of strangers can create a country in the middle of the Wyoming wasteland, then anything is possible! Puff that idea up to a global scale and you have the next stage of social evolution \u2014 Web 3.0 \u2014 a global blockchain-based state that gets rid of all the rigid authority, messy politicking, and gross inefficiency of a human-run government.As of 2022, CityDAO is still out there, building Eden in a sea of tumbleweeds. But that\u2019s not to say it, and the entire cryptocurrency industry, hasn\u2019t had its share of growing pains. In mid-January 2022 a hacker gained control of the CityDAO\u2019s admin account and stole 26.67 ETH (about $95,000). The same week that CityDAO was duped, hackers stole $30 million from Crypto.com. In 2021 alone, over $21 billion was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges. It\u2019s a pirate economy built by, and for, thieves.13 years after Satoshi\u2019s paper the only thing that cryptocurrencies have proven useful for is money laundering, tax evasion, outright scams, and most importantly, financial speculation. You can\u2019t buy a house, or even a pizza, with Bitcoin. (Or, why would you want to if the price could change by 10% in ten minutes?) Ultimately, cryptocurrencies are not currencies, but speculative assets: stocks that have no dividends, post no earnings, and are ultimately worth exactly zero dollars.And then there are the environmental costs, usually downplayed by crypto-boosters. Bitcoin mining alone uses 91 terawatt-hours of electricity yearly. That\u2019s more electricity than Sweden, 91 times more energy than Google, and .5% of energy consumption worldwide. And that\u2019s all without providing anything as delicious as a kottbullar, or as ergonomic as a Gursken.What Bitcoin shows is the widespread disbelief that technology can fail; that innovation and adoption (or usefulness) are two different things. Instead of the techno revolution promised in Satoshi\u2019s white paper, we have a giant carbon-spewing, Ponzi-scheme whose main innovation is to promote the sound investment advice of \u201Cbuy low, sell high\u201D.Despite all the obvious economic, environmental, and social hazards involved with crypto, there\u2019s got to be something to it. I mean, everyone is getting in on it \u2014 influencers, celebrities, probably your nephews. And why not? As long as the line keeps going up, we\u2019re all going to get rich? And you want to be rich, don\u2019t you?And what about the blockchain? Surely, given all the hype there\u2019s bound to be something useful there? Who wouldn\u2019t want a digital vending machine that sells titles, wills, or citizenship instead of Snickers bars, or be able to make a few cents from NFT-minted digital identity every time Facebook sells your info to marketers?Unfortunately, the same qualities that make blockchain appealing \u2014 its decentralization, security, immutability \u2014 also make it incredibly slow, wasteful, and devoid of any privacy or consumer protections. The fact is, anything that you can do on blockchain can be better done on a centralized server. As blockchain skeptics have attested, it\u2019s a solution looking for a problem.But even if no one uses Shibu Inu coin, or gets their Excitable Slug NFT marketplace off the ground, it doesn\u2019t mean that the impacts of these new speculative assets won\u2019t be far-reaching. There is now $3 trillion dollars invested in cryptocurrency, tied, more than ever, with larger markets through publicly traded companies like Coinbase, ETFs, and soon even your 401k. And like the mortgage-back derivatives of the early 00\u2019s, the more these totally unregulated, fraud-ridden assets infiltrate the financial system the more unstable it will become. What started as a critique of the financial crash, will probably soon repeat it.But, the push for a technology that (so far) obviously fails to deliver on any of its promises portends something deeper than just cheap populism. Crypto and blockchain are appealing to venture-capitalist vampires like Peter Thiel or McKinsey & Company because they are another step towards a digitized, financialized future where everything and everyone can be bought in the market. An anarcho-libertarians' utopia where there are no gods, no masters, only the Market. Sola coda, sola blockchain.This paradise is sold as the only means of escape from the increasingly dreary, hopeless future that most young people find themselves in. Would you rather retire early after betting it all on Shibu Inu coin or slave away for the foreseeable future as an Instacart serf? And like most utopian projects \u2014 whose eminence is always just around the corner \u2014 faith fills in the meantime. It doesn\u2019t matter what blockchain can do, but what you believe it will do. It doesn\u2019t matter that most cryptocurrencies are clearly scams, only that they will \u2014 as long as that line goes up \u2014 free you from your shitty job.What the rise of crypto really shows is the failure of any social or political movements to provide a meaningful answer to the post-2008 financial crisis. Instead of instituting new democratic controls on the market, we turned our rage at the financial system into a speculative commodity. If that\u2019s not what makes America great, what does?What this desperate need for social mobility at any cost fuels is techno-fetishism pumped to new religious heights. Because the technologies are so clearly useless, all we\u2019re left with is the empty, irrational belief that messianic geniuses and magical technologies can save us from our political, social, and environmental ills. (And get us all rich doing so, of course.) And this belief is backed by the same basic myth of the printing press, rewritten to the digital age: where new technologies, and the social changes they produce, are seen as teleological. Basically, God\u2019s will.Unfortunately, the origin story of the printing press \u2014 the Ur-myth about the socially transformative power of technology\u2014 falls apart after a cursory glance at its history.The first use of moveable type technology \u2014 the basis for the printing press \u2014 was invented 150 years before Gutenberg by a Korean minister named Choe Yun-In. Although Yun-In\u2019s press produced a few religious works, it ultimately failed to have any immediate, long-term impact in East Asia. Even in Europe, the adoption of printing technology was fairly slow. For the first hundred years after Gutenberg\u2019s invention in 1450, books were still mainly a hobby for the upper classes, a luxury item used to gain prestige, a way to continue the scholarly religious debates of the middle ages, or even used as loan collateral.In short, technologies are always a product of, and used within, a social order. The printing press was not some overnight revelation, but was slowly adopted and expanded over a period of hundreds of years. What accelerated its expansion in the early 16th century were changing social, economic, and environmental conditions. Luther\u2019s 95 Theses spread so quickly because they landed in the fertile ground of medieval Catholic Europe. A thousand-year order was being undermined by the growth of market-based economies, rising competition between proto-Capitalist states, and the failure of a feudal agricultural system to deal with the colder climate of the Little Ice Age. But the Reformation didn\u2019t happen overnight. Luther\u2019s ideas had been building for centuries before they finally reached a critical mass. It was then through the spread of the written word that they metastasized \u2014 and eventually helped destroy \u2014 the feudal order.In contrast, the fact that crypto and blockchain has exploded so rapidly onto the market shows that this isn\u2019t a real social or technological movement, but a religious one.What we\u2019re witnessing is a grift disguised as a revival. At the forefront are pump-and-dump preachers hawking junk technologies whose rapid, zealous adoption only shows their speculative superficiality. What they created with cryptocurrencies is a new casino for desperate people to gamble their savings away as a way to escape the misery of their own lives. And it doesn\u2019t matter how much money is lost, stolen, or scammed, as long as the fantasy is maintained: a techno-heaven where nobody works and everybody gets rich. And who wouldn\u2019t want to step through those pearly gates? All you have to do is roll the dice, and pray.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*wiwbp67EbYhsh5T08hJL-w.jpeg","author":"Chad Oelke","title":"The Great Blockchain of Being","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/marker\/the-great-blockchain-of-being-ea604c56de8","tags":[]},{"summary":"The happy day has arrived. Rejoice, one and all, because if you\u2019re reading this, Berachain Public Testnet \u201CArtio\u201D is live.","date":"Jan 11, 2024","post_content":"The happy day has arrived. Rejoice, one and all, because if you\u2019re reading this, Berachain Public Testnet \u201CArtio\u201D is live.At long last, we\u2019re excited to reveal Berachain to the world.First and foremost, the question that\u2019s been on everyone\u2019s mind for months:Since our inception in 2022, people haven\u2019t known exactly what we do or what the chain is, or why they should care (our fault and kind of by design). So without further ado, let\u2019s get into it.Berachain is an EVM equivalent L1 built on top of the Cosmos SDK, using Proof of Liquidity (PoL) Consensus, a variant of delegated Proof of Stake.What is Proof of Liquidity? In short, proof of liquidity is a sybil resistance mechanism meant to harmonize staking and align incentives between security and liquidity. This stands contrary to typical proof of stake chains where users possessing a fixed amount of capital have to choose between contributing to security by staking with a validator, or contributing to on-chain liquidity by providing liquidity in a DEX or lending platform.In Proof of Liquidity, the only way to contribute towards network security is by first doing the \u201Cwork\u201D of providing liquidity to a set of DeFi primitives that are built into the chain itself; namely a native AMM DEX, a perps exchange, and a stablecoin lending platform.The only way to earn BGT, the staking token of the chain which contributes to security, is by providing liquidity to the system. BGT is naturally illiquid and soulbound, and cannot be market bought, only earned.Validators and governance play a large role within PoL, and effectively control the \u201Crewards rate\u201D for different methods of earning BGT across the chain. Block by block, the validators direct the inflation back into the Berachain ecosystem across multiple primitives, keeping the network liquid. However, this can extend to any governance-approved smart contract on the chain over time.Each validator can set its own set of incentives and distribution of the BGT rewards it receives across a wide variety of governance-approved protocols. The weighted average of all of these distributions across the ~100 validators in the network will determine the APYs of each pool. The best mental model for this is Curve \/ Frax gauges, except in this case instead of veFXS\/veCRV, it is the average weighting and distribution of BGT across the validator set which determines network wide rewards rates.Users delegating BGT will earn fees in the form of $HONEY, the native stablecoin of the network from the various protocols that are part of (or become part of) Proof of Liquidity, along with bribes from the validator that they are delegated to (more on this later).Finally, users can redeem or burn 1 BGT into 1 BERA at any point in time. However, this is a one-way process. Once the BGT is burned, it is gone for good. This gives them a choice between holding the liquid gas token, or holding a token which allows them to earn fees in the form of a stablecoin + bribes + influence the distribution of rewards across the ecosystem, while accruing fees from applications powered by BGT emissions.So in short, Berachain is fully EVM compatible L1 where users provide liquidity into the chain-enshrined primitives (dex, perps, stable lend, or others voted in by governance) to earn BGT, delegate it with validators to earn fees \/ bribes, or burn it into Bera. Through their contribution to liquidity on the chain, users bootstrap its security.Why should developers or protocols care?Berachain is the first chain with mechanics structured to sustainably enable protocols to build their liquidity base and drive capital efficiency over time.Protocols who successfully pass a governance vote will have their smart contracts included in the set of contracts whose LPs will receive BGT rewards (in the same way as the dex \/ perps \/ lend LPs receive rewards at genesis). This means that a new NFT AMM, on-chain game, SoFi protocol, or any other DApp requiring that extra helping hand in bootstrapping their protocol could launch on Berachain and effectively subsidize their cost of user acquisition by passing a governance vote for their vault \/ LP contract to receive BGT rewards, thereby giving their LPs emissions in the form of the staking\/gas token of an L1 blockchain (in addition to any native token emissions).In short, protocols are able to attract more liquidity at lower costs. The chain is aligned, as it attracts the best protocols to build on top of it which serve as user acquisition channels. PoL allows protocols building on the chain to become \u201Censhrined\u201D into the base layer and contribute to security (BGT generation) via their users\u2019 liquidity provisioning without modifying user behaviour.Typically, in bootstrapping liquidity, a protocol will launch a liquidity mining program, in which they pair their own native token against another token, and require users to stake this LP in exchange for emissions in the form of their native token, generally inflating or devaluing their native token. On Berachain, a protocol may work directly with validator(s) to bribe for liquidity in the native dex in the following process:Why should users care?Berachain\u2019s private testnet and months of buildup have provided us with a thriving ecosystem. We strongly believe that an ecosystem can get off the ground quickly with effective planning. The basic primitives are built into the chain, discouraging a series of repetitive forks which are normally the short-lived basis of new chain launches. This will be bolstered by the 30+ native protocols and 100+ groups building from other chains which will be deploying on Berachain.Users can have their stake and eat it too \u2014 users who LP will earn BGT emissions, contributing to security, and be able to stake those BGT emissions to help influence the direction of liquidity across the chain, while earning bribes and fees from the network. This means that a user can tangibly impact their own economic incentives by participating in network, at no cost to themselves (eg. A user farming a stable pool LP in the DEX may choose to stake their BGT with a validator directing the majority of their BGT emissions to that stable pool, thereby increasing the user\u2019s effective rewards or earnings on their existing LP)New game theory always brings out new ways to win in an ecosystem; the tradeoffs between BGT and Bera at different points in an economic cycle will give users an entirely new way to play \u2014 is it better to stake BGT and earn more network fees when not much is staked? Which validators will have the best bribes? Will they even reap the rewards of that new liquidity if they accept the bribe?At times this is a meme, but Berachain has a real community. There are thousands of NFT holders who have already bought into the ecosystem, and multiple projects that have formed their own communities even prior to the launch of this testnet with thousands of engaged users \u2014 see Infrared, Kodiak, The Honey Jar, Berachein, Ramen Finance, Beradrome, Beramarket, Goldilocks and more. There are podcasts, community rating services, public goods and a raving group of crypto-natives who are often the earliest users of new and exciting protocols across the space. They\u2019ve been waiting for over a year, and they\u2019re ready to go.Why should validators care?Validators are first class citizens in Berachain, controlling economic incentives and reward rates across the ecosystem; an unprecedented role and set of responsibilities for validators across crypto.There\u2019s an opportunity to attract new capital and engage in a new form of governance. For Cosmos validators, they can now attract delegates and liquidity from the EVM world, which has typically been a major restriction for growth in the Cosmos ecosystem.This responsibility also brings new revenue streams to validators. Validators on Berachain may receive bribes or rewards from protocols building on the chain in exchange for directing BGT block rewards towards their pools or smart contracts. This allows a validator to diversify their treasury \/ holdings, receiving exposure to new protocols on the chain at no cost to their own users and delegates.Why should blockchain purists care?We talk a lot about how the blockchain trilemma has become a bit of a meme; decentralization turning into a form of regulatary arbitrage, scalability never reaching par with offchain\/web2 options, and security being ignored until proven otherwise. The ideal chain probably maxes out on all of these properties, but a more practical trilemma perhaps revolves around users, developers, and capital\/liquidity.

While the Raydium frontend provides a user-friendly interface for swapping tokens, not all users interact with the platform through this interface. Developers, in particular, may need to build applications or server-side scripts that interact directly with the Raydium smart contracts to facilitate token swaps or leverage other Raydium features.In this article, we\u2019ll provide a brief overview of the swap instructions in the Raydium smart contracts. Additionally, we\u2019ll walk through a code example that demonstrates how to build a script for swapping tokens on the Raydium AMM using TypeScript.Prerequisites:The Raydium.io AMM program is implemented in native Rust. Its structure resembles a basic vanilla Rust program with additional Rust files for logging (log.rs), mathematical computations (math.rs), and cross-program invocations (invoker.rs).For this article, we will be focusing on the SwapBaseIn and SwapBaseOut instructions.The Raydium AMM program uses two instructions to exchange tokens; SwapBaseIn and SwapBaseOut. These two instructions accept similar accounts but differ in functionality. If the output token is the base token, we use the SwapBaseOut else we use the SwapBaseIn. These instructions can be found at swap-instruction. We aim to write a script to exchange SOL for USDC on Raydium using typescript.2. Create a tsconfig.json file and add the following;3. Create a package.json file and add the following;4. Install dependencies;\nnpm install5. Install ts-node;\nnpm install -g ts-node6. Create a src folder and add the main.ts file in the src folder.As described in the contract code, the swap instructions accept 18 accounts and two instruction data. To successfully invoke the instruction, we need to fetch these accounts using the AMM ID of the SOL-USDC pool.In the main.ts file, we\u2019re going to be creating the function that gets the accounts needed to execute the swap instruction from the AMM ID. Populate the main.ts file with the code below;The function takes two arguments: the SOL-USDC pool address and a web3 connection object. It fetches and decodes the pool account data and the market account data associated with the provided pool address.The market authority is a Program Derived Address (PDA) owned by the OpenBook market program. It is derived using the pool\u2019s market ID and the market vault signer nonce, which were generated when the pool was initially created.The hardcoded authority address is the Raydium v4 liquidity pool authority.To create the swap instruction, we need to calculate the expected amount of USDC\/SOL we want to receive based on the set slippage. The following function is used to achieve that;The function uses the Liquidity class provided by the Raydium SDK to calculate the expected amount of tokens to receive. It accepts the pool keys, tokens to buy (USDC\/SOL), amount of tokens to swap, and slippage tolerance.Next, we add the function to create the swap instruction. The function accepts a connection object, a token to buy, the amount of SOL\/USDC to exchange, the slippage, and the key pair of the signer. Before creating the swap instruction, the function gets token accounts for the input and output tokens, respectively. If the token accounts do not exist for the key pair, it creates the accounts before making the swap instruction. To learn more about Solana token accounts, visit this link. Also in the case of SOL input\/output, the function creates a wrapped SOL token account for the key pair.This is the final part of the script. In this section, we create a function to make swap instructions and submit a transaction to swap SOL for USDC and USDC for SOL. Add the following code to the main.ts file:To execute this function, we must generate a Solana keypair in the project directory and load it with 0.01 SOL. Run the following code in the project terminal to generate the key pair:You can install solana-cli tools using this link.To exchange 0.01 SOL for USDC, add the following code to the main.ts file and run npm run swap;On successful transaction execution, the terminal should display the following output:This transaction can be viewed on Solscan using this link.To exchange USDC back into SOL, replace the USDC address in the earlier call with the WSOL mint address as follows and run the script again:In this article, we\u2019ve had a brief description of the Raydium AMM program, swap instructions, and how to invoke these instructions to exchange tokens using Typescript. The full script for this article can be found in this GitHub gist. You can also drop a comment if you\u2019d like to see this in any other programming languages (python, Rust).Happy hacking 👍🚀🇳🇬","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*HD9ihrwg2t0IriSKNsD6eQ.jpeg","author":"Oluwatobiloba Emmanuel","title":"Raydium AMM: Trading SPL tokens on Raydium using Typescript","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@teepy\/raydium-amm-trading-spl-tokens-on-raydium-using-typescript-e34173b776ba","tags":[]},{"summary":"ECONOMIC MODEL: Weird\u200A\u2014\u200Atoken of the Weird Friends project, Neutron network.

Let\u2019s embark on a detailed exploration of the Ouroboros journey, unraveling its origins, distinctive attributes, and progressive iterations.Derived from the ancient symbol of a serpent devouring its own tail, Ouroboros represents perpetual renewal and cyclicality. Within Cardano, Ouroboros embodies the concept of a blockchain\u2019s enduring existence. The protocol integrates cutting-edge technology and rigorously vetted processes, ensuring the resilience and longevity of blockchain networks that adopt it.Ouroboros stands out through its utilization of advanced technology and methodically validated mechanisms, drawing insights from behavioral psychology and economic philosophy. It implements a \u201CNakamoto-style consensus\u201D based on proof-of-stake, delivering robustness akin to Bitcoin while notably enhancing energy efficiency, transaction speed, decentralization, and equitable reward distribution.Ensuring fair and secure slot leader selection requires randomness. Ouroboros protocol, particularly Ouroboros Praos and Ouroboros Genesis, incorporates a feature called Global Random Oracle that produces unique randomness in each cycle. This is achieved using a Verifiable Random Function, storing a random value in each produced block, with the blockchain itself as the source of new randomness.Ouroboros incentive mechanism considers key scenarios: stake pools can only mint blocks if they represent a certain threshold of stakeholders, preventing fragmentation attacks, and rewards become constant for pools with high aggregate stake, discouraging centralization. That\u2019s how it emerges as the leading Proof of Stake technology, exclusively implemented in the Cardano blockchain.Meanwhile, the widely-discussed Ouroboros Leios upgrade aims to enhance transaction efficiency and scalability. By leveraging its consensus mechanism, Cardano anticipates bolstering its transaction processing capabilities while maintaining decentralization principles intact.The Ouroboros journey unfolds through several iterative phases, each introducing novel features and enhancements to bolster security, decentralization, and efficiency.Ouroboros Classic (2017)Energy-Efficient Proof-of-Stake: Ouroboros Classic pioneered an energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus protocol in 2017, significantly reducing the ecological footprint compared to proof-of-work systems.Mathematical Framework: It laid the groundwork for a mathematical framework to analyze proof-of-stake protocols, enhancing understanding and confidence in the protocol\u2019s security.Ouroboros BFT (May 2020)Transition to Decentralization: Deployed in May 2020, Ouroboros BFT facilitated Cardano\u2019s transition to a more decentralized network, laying the groundwork for subsequent protocol advancements.Federated Node Consensus: It provided ledger consensus among federated nodes, ensuring network integrity and stability during the decentralization process.Ouroboros Praos (2020)Decentralized Block Production: Launched in 2020, Ouroboros Praos introduced decentralized block production, empowering stake pools and fostering network participation.Enhanced Security Features: Praos implemented robust security measures, including defense mechanisms against Sybil attacks and secure slot leader selection, fortifying the protocol against adversarial threats.Ouroboros Genesis (2022)Novel Chain Selection Rules: Ouroboros Genesis introduces innovative chain selection rules, optimizing blockchain bootstrapping and resilience.Efficient Network Bootstrap: It enables efficient blockchain bootstrapping directly from the Genesis Block, streamlining network initialization and enhancing scalability.Ouroboros CrypsinousPrivacy-Preserving Properties: While not planned for Cardano, Ouroboros Crypsinous introduces privacy-preserving features, expanding the protocol\u2019s utility to applications requiring enhanced privacy and anonymity.Ouroboros ChronosHigh-Resilience Time Source: Ouroboros Chronos aims to bolster resilience in critical infrastructures by providing a high-resilience cryptographic time source based on blockchain technology, ensuring network synchronization and reliability.Ouroboros LeiosInput Endorsers and Optimization: Ouroboros Leios introduces input endorsers and optimization innovations to optimize consensus protocol throughput, catering to evolving network demands and increasing transaction efficiency.Recently, Cardano\u2019s co-founder Charles Hoskinson has pointed out the two major upgrades coming to the blockchain. This includes the Chang Hard Fork and Ouroboros Leios consensus mechanism.Set for the second quarter of 2024, the Chang hard fork shall grant ADA holders voting rights on proposals, a significant step forward in Cardano\u2019s decentralization journey. The upgrade\u2019s objective is to empower the Cardano community with greater influence over the governance of the Cardano network.Aiming to democratize the governance of the network\u2026.READ A FULL ARTICLE ON CARDANO SPOT.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*9L6_BEFpptW-DXiO.png","author":"Cardano Spot","title":"The Chang Hard Fork And Ouroboros Journey","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@cardanospot\/the-chang-hard-fork-and-ouroboros-journey-1e90ba87df0b","tags":["Crypto","Cardano","Cardano News Today","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency"]},{"summary":"Are you ready to take your crypto journey to the next level and start earning passive income with LRSNode?

It\u2019s not. There are MEV bots right now making millions of dollars per month in profits.However on the other hand there are many scammers that take advantage of this information and pretend to have such bots just to steal your money.This is not one of those scammer posts. I have years of experience working with MEV bots and today I\u2019ll explain to you the 3 major types of MEV bots and how they work, so hopefully you have a better understanding of this exciting industry and maybe even build your own bots.There are 3 major types of MEV bots, those are:There are other specialized categories but those won\u2019t be covered here. So how do those MEV bots work?To understand that, you have to understand how Ethereum works. In the Ethereum blockchain there is something called the mempool.When you send a transaction, say transfer 10 ether to your friend John, that transaction is not processed immediately. It is sent to the mempool, a place where all the transactions are sent.There, your transaction will be sorted and included in the next available block based on demand. The more demand, meaning the more people making transactions the more time it will take to include your transaction.The problem with the mempool is that everybody can see your transaction before it is confirmed and added to a block.Why is that important? It\u2019s important because with MEV you\u2019re able to send private transactions that protect you from the public mempool.They have a separate pool that is hidden where your transaction goes.Not only that, with tools like Flashbots you\u2019re able to take someone else's transaction from the public mempool and put your own transaction before or right after theirs. This is key for MEV bots.I know it sounds confusing but it will make sense later on.So let\u2019s start with understanding how Arbitrage MEV bots work:These are the most popular type of MEV bots. The way arbitrage bots make money is by buying a token in an exchange like Uniswap and selling at another like Sushiswap where there\u2019s a price difference while you keep some.Let me repeat that, you buy a token at one place cheap and you sell it for a profit at another exchange where that same token is worth more.That\u2019s pretty much how arbitrage bots work. You can repeat the process with more complex strategies where you buy other tokens, where you buy at once place, sell it at another for an intermediary token and then sell the intermediary token for ether.The complexities of arbitrage bots are unlimited. I\u2019ve seen arbitrage bots buying tokens with ether, then buy an intermediary token for tether and selling those tether for the initial token that is then sold for ether.In other words, you can create complex strategies to take advantage of opportunities that aren\u2019t taken by other bots.Arbitrage bots are essential in trading. They make sure the price of tokens are the same at every exchange and are rewarded for doing so.Let\u2019s now see how sandwich bots work (my favorite type of MEV bots):Sandwich bots are the ones that buy before someone else and sell right after that person.To understand sandwich bot you need to understand 2 concepts:Slippage is a hard concept to understand, so make sure to re-read this section. If you go to uniswap right now and select a token to buy, you\u2019ll be able to setup the maximum slippage.It usually is 0.1% or 1%. What does that mean?Slippage is another way of saying \u201CI\u2019m willing to accept 1% less than the initial price I set\u201DSay you want to buy 100 $MEVDAO tokens. During the time you send the transaction and until it is confirmed, many other people may buy the token.Ethereum is interacted by millions of people everyday. Whenever someone buys the token $MEVDAO, the price is moved so instead of getting 100 tokens for 1 ether, you now get 90 tokens for 1 ether.The token got more expensive because the demand increased, the supply was reduced the moment someone bought it.So when you send a transaction and until it is confirmed other people will buy that same token you want. Why is this a problem?Because now instead of receiving 100 tokens for 1 ether you get 90 tokens for 1 ether before your transaction is confirmed. That is a slippage of 10%.So if your settings allow a slippage of 10%, then your transaction will be executed correctly, but if you allow a slippage of 5% your transaction will not be executed, it will be rejected because you don\u2019t want a worse price.Why is slippage important then?Because sandwich bots take advantage of this important concept. Sandwich bots are able to see what swaps people want to make by reading the mempool.Then a sandwich bot calculates how much the bot has to buy to move the price so that John gets exactly the slippage or the minimum amount out.So if John wants 100 tokens but has a slippage of 5%, then he\u2019s okay with receiving 95 tokens.Sandwich bots are so smart that they know exactly how much to buy of that token so that John gets exactly 95 tokens.The process goes like this:As you can see, after the bot buys and after John buys the sandwich bot sells those tokens.The bot doesn\u2019t want those tokens, the bot wants Ether. So he\u2019s swapping back those tokens for Ether while keeping the difference in profit.Where does the profit come from?It comes from the fact that John\u2019s purchase made those tokens more expensive, meaning you get more ether for the same tokens. That\u2019s where the profit comes from.How is this possible?All of this is possible because there\u2019s a nice tool called MEV bundles.MEV bundles are simply ordered, private transactions.It\u2019s a way of taking a public transaction from the mempool and put your transaction before or after it. You can put as many transaction as you want before or after.So they allow sandwich bots to buy before John, then allow John to buy and then sell those tokens for a profit.I know that was a lot. There are many new concepts you may not be familiar with, you probably have a million more questions about.In any case, join my community at https:\/\/t.me\/mevdao so we can help you join this exciting world of MEV.With that said, let\u2019s continue with the last type of MEV bot:With the creation of lending platforms like aave finance and compound finance, a new way of making money became possible.You see, those platforms are fully decentralized. People can take loans, lend money and repay loans without anybody\u2019s permission.There are many elements that make this possible. One of those elements that make decentralized lending possible is the use of collateral.A collateral is just some money put aside that serves as a guarantee for a loan. When you borrow say 1000 USDT, you have to provide about 2000 dollars worth of Ether as collateral.Those 2000 dollars worth of ETH are locked away and kept safely while you use those 1000 USDT for whatever purpose you want.When you\u2019re finished and ready to repay your loan, you give those 1000 USDT and get your 2000 ETH back.This system works very well however there is 1 issue with it, and that is\u2026What happens if those 2000 dollars worth of ether drop in value?Imagine you lock away 1 ether worth 2000 dollars at the time you get your loan. Let\u2019s say you spend 30 days to repay your loan. During that time ether drops in value from 2000 to just 800 dollars.Now your collateral is only worth 800 dollars because you locked away 1 ether. But you got a 1000 USDT loan. See the problem? You are getting more money than what you used as a guarantee.Before that happens, lending platforms will detect that and see \u201Cether value is dropping, this loan for 1000 tether is at risk, we have to close it to protect our lenders\u201DAt that point liquidators come in. The loan becomes invalid because it\u2019s risky and the platform doesn\u2019t want to lose money.Liquidators simply execute a function that sells that 1 ether used as collateral and repays those 1000 tether to the loan providers while giving some of the collateral to the liquidator that executed the function.Liquidation MEV bots profit from closing loans.They look for expired or risky loans that can be closed for a profit and execute those functions.Liquidator MEV bots simply make money from closing bad loans.There are many lending protocols and those bots profit by helping protect their ecosystem from people that don\u2019t repay their loans or from collateral drops.That\u2019s about it! You now know how the major MEV bots work. Those bots are making almost billions of dollars per year (combined) in profit so the possibilities are endless.You can take a piece of that huge pie.

The core team behind it is the same as the Hubble Protocol.Marius Ciubotariu is the co-founder of Hubble and Project Lead of Kamino. With a degree in Business Economics, he worked in traditional finance (TradFi), as derivative product specialist and then as senior software engineer at Bloomberg LP, writing C++ and exploring Rust on the side as a hobby.Mark Hull is the core contributor of Kamino. He has a BSc in Business Administration and Management at the Manchester Metropolitan University. He,too, worked in TradFi in the service and project management at Credit Suisse for seven years and as Vice President at Swiss Re for eight years, before entering the crypto world as a contributor at Hubble Protocol.Currently (May 2024) no funds have been raised.Kamino Finance is addressing a variety of issues in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space on the Solana blockchain through its suite of products.These issues revolve primarily around the complexities and inefficiencies associated with liquidity management, leverage, and market speculation in a decentralized context.One of the primary challenges in the DeFi landscape is the complexity associated with managing liquidity. Liquidity is often fragmented even within the same protocol, leading to high slippage rates and less efficient markets. Traditional liquidity provision methods also expose providers to risks such as impermanent loss, where the value of deposited tokens changes compared to when they were deposited. This is particularly problematic in volatile markets.Additionally, managing liquidity positions requires constant monitoring and adjustment, which can be cumbersome and technically demanding. In traditional settings, liquidity providers (LPs) need to constantly monitor and adjust their positions to align with market conditions, often requiring sophisticated strategies to maximize returns and minimize risks.Another issue is the risk and complexity involved in leveraging investments in the DeFi space. Existing leverage options in DeFi can be complex and risky, often requiring users to engage with multiple protocols to achieve desired exposure. This increases transaction costs and operational risks, including the potential for liquidations in fast-moving markets.Moreover traditional DeFi platforms often utilize liquidity pools where capital is distributed across a wide range of prices, much of which may not be actively utilized. This setup leads to inefficiencies, as large amounts of capital are locked up without contributing to active trading, thereby reducing potential returns for liquidity providers.In environments with thin liquidity, trades of substantial size can significantly move prices, resulting in high slippage. This is especially problematic in volatile market conditions or for assets with lower trading volumes, deterring larger traders from participating.Furthermore many DeFi platforms specialize in either lending, trading, or liquidity provision, but few offer a seamless integration of these services. This fragmentation requires users to interact with multiple platforms, complicating the user experience and increasing transaction costs.Upon exploring the existing DeFi landscape, especially the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem, Marius recognized a gap in the market and a growth opportunity within Solana. Noting a lack of stablecoin options on Solana at the time, Marius decided to launch a project to create a stablecoin, which laid the groundwork for Hubble Protocol.The idea for Kamino developed from the need to support the DeFi ecosystem on Solana further, particularly around stablecoins and lending\/borrowing frameworks. Kamino, aimed to build functionalities that would allow for capital efficiency and utility for stablecoins and other assets within the Solana network. This included creating optimized liquidity pools and lending markets that could support leveraged positions in a risk-aware manner.Kamino Finance is a DeFi protocol that seeks to amalgamate several financial functionalities (lending, liquidity provision and leveraged investment) within a single product suite.Initially, Kamino focused primarily on offering simplified solutions for liquidity providers to participate in yield-generating activities, especially through auto-compounding concentrated liquidity strategies. This approach is designed to optimize the process of earning returns from liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).As it evolved, Kamino expanded its services to include more complex features, currently (May 2024) such as:The integration of these services into a single protocol is intended to streamline user experience and potentially increase the efficiency of capital use within the DeFi ecosystem. Kamino places a significant emphasis on user experience, providing a platform that offers detailed analytics and performance data to help users manage and evaluate their investments more effectively.Kamino Lend (K-Lend) (Borrow\/Lend section) system powers automated products like Multiply and Long\/Short, and also functions as a standalone borrow\/lend market.Traditionally, many lending platforms use multiple liquidity pools. Each pool is separate and holds different combinations of assets, with each pool having its own set of parameters and conditions. This setup can lead to fragmented liquidity, meaning that the money available to lend or borrow is spread thin across many pools, which can reduce the efficiency of the lending process.Kamino Lend\u2019s approach is different. It uses a Unified Liquidity Market, which means it combines all the assets into a single pool. This centralization of resources has several benefits:This allows the Elevation Mode, an innovative feature within the Unified Liquidity Market for increased leverage while maintaining capital efficiency (introduced in Aave V3 as Efficiency Mode). This simplifies and enhances the borrowing experience:In the DeFi world, liquidity providers (LPs) play a crucial role by depositing their cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools. These pools are essential for enabling trading on decentralized exchanges without the need for traditional market makers. When you provide liquidity, you typically receive LP tokens that represent your share of the pool.Automated liquidity (Liquidity product) vaults were Kamino\u2019s first product, launched in August 2022. Kamino liquidity vaults issue kTokens to depositors, which are yield-bearing LP tokens that are accepted as collateral in K-Lend.The growth of Uni V3 and concentrated liquidity as DeFi\u2019s primary liquidity model has virtually stopped leveraged LPing in its tracks. This is because LP positions from CLMMs (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) are non-fungible, and cannot easily be used as collateral nor levered up.Kamino\u2019s automated liquidity infrastructure tokenizes CLMM LP positions. These positions, called kTokens, are fungible, easily liquidatable SPL tokens.These kTokens form the basis of powerful DeFi strategies such as leveraged liquidity provision, or delta-neutral liquidity provision.When you deposit your LP tokens into Kamino Lend, called kTokens, these act as a proof of your deposit, much like a receipt, but they also continue to earn yield from the liquidity pool. This yield is auto-compounded, meaning it\u2019s automatically reinvested to increase your earnings over time without any effort on your part.Kamino automates the entire LP process and optimizes capital efficiency & yields through:If you deposit into the mSOL-SOL vault on Kamino, you receive the kmSOL-SOL kToken and then deposit this kToken into Kamino Lend, to borrow SOL which can be redeposited into the mSOL-SOL vault, which means you mint more kmSOL-SOL tokens.As long as the liquidity vault yield remains higher than the borrow APY of SOL, your position earns positive Net APY.The innovation here is that kTokens can be used as collateral for borrowing other assets on the platform. This means you can unlock additional capital based on your initial investment without having to withdraw from the liquidity pool. Essentially, it allows liquidity providers to maintain their position and benefits in the pool, such as earning trading fees, while also being able to borrow funds for other uses.On K-Lend, you can opt to keep collateral assets from being borrowed by other users, thus protecting assets from any borrower default risks.Such assets, referred to as Protected Collateral, can still be used as collateral for borrowing by the depositor, but they do not earn interest on these assets. Protected collateral can be withdrawn at any time.Then the Multiply section is a one-click vault product that enables you to leverage your exposure to yield-bearing assets, by combining underlying K-Lend mechanisms like eMode and kToken collateral to offer powerful yield strategies.The core idea of Multiply is to enhance a user\u2019s exposure to a chosen asset by using borrowed funds, thereby amplifying potential returns through leverage.Multiply operates by allowing users to open a leverage position against yield-bearing assets such as JitoSOL by borrowing SOL, the underlying asset. This process is facilitated by two primary features within the Kamino ecosystem: Elevation Mode (eMode) and flash loans. eMode enables users to achieve higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, which in practice means higher leverage.It basically uses the kToken lending strategy in a yield loop.(The risks associated with this method are primarily linked to liquidation scenarios. If the borrow rate exceeds the yield on the staked asset for a prolonged period, the increasing debt might reach a threshold that triggers liquidation)The project currently doesn\u2019t have a defined roadmap (May 2024).Kamino has completed numerous external audits, currently (May 2024) 10 audits that can be reviewed on his GitHub.Continue the analysis by reading the Tokenomics on the App\u2026Finish the analysis by reading the Conclusion on the App\u2026Continue the analysis by discovering the FV Score on the App\u2026Want to decide on the next crypto to be analyzed?

These products use models that can learn from data and generate something new, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Bard chatbots.Generative AI can create content of all kinds, but it can also raise questions about its origin and veracity. To solve this, tools such as cryptographic keys and blockchain technology can be applied, which allow the authenticity and identity of content and people to be verified.AI and Web3 can collaborate positively, as they can leverage shared management of data, especially data that is private and sensitive, such as medical records, as well as content verification and prevention of deep fakes, which are fakes created with generative AI.To prevent manipulation, cryptographic private keys and digital signatures can be used, which serve to ensure the origin and truth of the content.\nOther benefits could be privacy protection from AI models or the reliability of payments.AI and everything related to blockchain have enormous potential to change the future, but they also have to overcome challenges and difficulties to demonstrate their value and usefulness in solving real problems and meeting the needs of people and industries.Real World Assets Tokenization (RWA) are real-world assets that are converted into digital tokens using blockchain technology and smart contracts . These tokens can be fungible or non-fungible (NFT) and represent ownership rights to the assets.The tokenization of RWA has the potential to transform many sectors and markets, as it allows assets to be fractionated and traded more efficiently, securely and transparently . In turn, it opens up new investment opportunities and access to greater liquidity, especially for illiquid assets such as real estate, art or private capital itself.RWAs also have great relevance for the crypto space, since they can connect traditional finance assets with decentralized finance (DeFi) , offering financial products and services without intermediaries and with fewer costs, so investors and participants can access loans, liquidity pools or staking, using RWA tokens.This trend can bring many benefits, such as saving money by eliminating intermediaries, improving the accessibility and transparency of assets, solving the liquidity problem of traditional assets and mainly attracting a new audience that is more skeptical when it comes to using cryptocurrencies.Visit: Top 10 Real World Asset Tokenization Companies 2024GameFi or better known as Play-to-Earn games , will continue to be a trend this year.Web3 games combine gaming with finance and use blockchain technology to decentralize game servers and avoid censorship, unlike traditional games.The particularity of these games is that players can use digital objects to buy them, lend them and do other operations with blockchain.GameFi gives players complete freedom over the items they obtain and own, thanks to tokenization. The objects are converted into digital tokens that can be fungible or non-fungible (NFT).Although it has been a trend within the sector since 2020, the Gaming sector continues to grow year after year and GameFi makes the game accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill or knowledge of crypto.However, they have certain risks that must be investigated and taken precautions, since not all games are unreliable, so players themselves should choose games with solid users, development and economics, to enjoy GameFi safely.NFTs have gone from being a trend to becoming an important part of the crypto ecosystem . In 2024, NFTs are expected to not be limited to digital art, as in the past, but will extend to various representative industries such as fashion or music.The tokenization of unique experiences and the direct connection between creators and consumers will continue to increase , transforming the way we value and own digital assets and thus expanding brand identity and the power of communities within digital spaces.The different uses that NFTs can have in 2024 make the future of digital assets promising, such as the integration of NFTs into the Metaverse .Virtual worlds are growing at a considerable rate, and consequently NFTs are going to play a key role in shaping the digital environment, from virtual properties to assets in video games, thus generating experiences that encompass the virtual with the physical.Other examples would be dynamic NFTs, or tokenized ones with a more social nature or those already mentioned above created by AI, thus creating a much more alive ecosystem and at the same time providing unique experiences that undoubtedly help the generation and development of much more communities. committed and that there is much more direct participation in decision-making by users.Therefore we see the path to which the crypto and web3 world is heading, which is allowing the creation of new decentralized products and services , and how technology contributes with these trends to improve the security, privacy and responsibility of the actors. digital.If the world of Blockchain and Web3 interests you and you want to know more details about them, then you cannot miss our training pill on the basic concepts of these two disciplines carried out by our expert Diego Ferragud, CEO & Founder of Criptendo.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*RjeyjCkUsvnUICz2","author":"BlockchainX","title":"Blockchain and Web3, trends in 2024","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/predict\/blockchain-and-web3-trends-in-2024-62bfeab96f71","tags":["Blockchain","Blockchain Technology","Cryptocurrency","Web3","Real Estate"]},{"summary":"Discover the top 5 cryptocurrencies to buy for a 100x return potential.

Diversifying your portfolio with these top 5 cryptocurrencies could position you for significant returns in the ever-evolving crypto market landscape.Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat currencies), cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. This technology allows transactions to be recorded in a secure and immutable manner across a distributed network of computers.One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is their decentralization, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity, such as a government or financial institution. This decentralization, coupled with the use of cryptography, ensures the security of transactions and the integrity of the cryptocurrency system.Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first decentralized cryptocurrency and remains the most widely known and traded. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own unique features and use cases. Cryptocurrencies can be used for various purposes, including online purchases, investments, and remittances, and as a means of transferring value across borders quickly and efficiently.Cryptocurrency investing involves buying, holding, and trading digital assets with the expectation of generating profit. Investors typically analyze factors such as technology, team, market demand, and adoption potential before investing. Strategies range from long-term holding (HODLing) to active trading based on market trends and news.Risks include market volatility, regulatory changes, and security vulnerabilities. It\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and stay updated with market trends. While the potential for high returns exists, investing in cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks and requires a disciplined approach to manage them effectively.DarkLume (DLUME) is a cryptocurrency associated with a metaverse platform that promises a unique blend of gaming, social interaction, and even a virtual economy.

To elaborate, we always consider the community factor first when designing a game. Will this bring fun to the community? Will this benefit the community? Will this in any way affect the community?The term \u201Ccommunity\u201D does not merely refer to the mass of people playing the same game. It is a broader term that describes the connection between content (the game) and the surrounding ecosystem. The community is partly the ecosystem and partly the content itself.Sidekick is our initial approach to building the community. We aimed to raise awareness about the game, have people enjoy the draw and talk about their experiences, invite other communities to the world of Supervillains, and create opportunities for inter-project collaboration. In short, we introduced Sidekicks to the world to energize a vibrant community.In this article, we\u2019d like to delve into more detail about Sidekicks. Some information is known, while other aspects are new ideas. We hope this text helps you understand our plans for Sidekicks and gets you excited about what\u2019s to come!Sidekicks are creatures in the upcoming Supervillain Idle RPG that enhance the abilities of Villains. Together, the two form a strong bond and eventually evolve into Supervillains, characters with ultimate power.Sidekicks can be acquired both outside and inside the game.Out-of-game, in the web environment, Sidekicks are obtained through web-based gacha, as was the case in the Sidekick Draw.Another method to acquire a new Sidekick will be through Sidekick Fusion, which we will cover later in this article. Sidekicks obtained from the web can be easily utilized in the game by using the Supervillain Inventory.In-game, they will appear during gameplay, and players will be able to capture them. These Sidekicks obtained in the game, however, are not tradable unless a special item is used to make them tradable. This measure is designed to prevent inflation in the Sidekick supply. More details on how this will work will be provided as the game approaches its launch.In the Supervillain Sidekick Draw, five different rarity grades could be found: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary.In the future, a sixth grade, Mythic, will be added. Mythic is a higher rarity than Legendary. Although still undisclosed, Mythic Sidekicks will only be obtainable by possessing Legendary Sidekicks. Details on how to obtain a Mythic Sidekick will be revealed soon, so please stay tuned!Legendary Sidekicks are exclusively available, meaning there is a limited supply.In-game, 1,000 Legendary Sidekicks will be distributed over 18 months. They cannot be purchased via in-app purchases (IAP) but will only be obtainable through gameplay.Out-of-game, in the web environment, there will also be 1,000 Legendary Sidekicks. They can be obtained either by gacha or Sidekick Fusion. (Please note that the number of total web Legendaries might exceed 1,000 in the unlikely event of two incidents occurring within a very short time span.)Additionally, more will be granted to top contributors to the game, such as rankers, creators, guild masters, etc. The method and numbers are yet to be disclosed, but please understand this as the direction we\u2019d like to build our policies toward.Now let\u2019s talk about Sidekick Fusion: Fusion is a way to get (the opportunity to get) a Sidekick of a higher grade, which includes Legendary.The scheme is as follows: You take 2 Sidekicks of the same rarity grade, fuse them together \u2014 and you get 1 new Sidekick of the same or higher grade. The 2 Sidekicks you used for the Fusion will be burnt.The higher the grades of the Fusion materials are, the more likely you are to get a Legendary Sidekick. Of course, if you are extremely lucky, you might be able to obtain a Legendary Sidekick by putting 2 Common Sidekicks together\u2026 Well, we hope for the best!Sidekick Fusion will be updated at https:\/\/supervlabs.io on May 29.The answer: On-Chain Randomness!Games are all about probabilities. Every action, like a character hitting a monster, is influenced by probabilities. From critical hits decided by chance to the random variability in basic damage and defense, randomness is a cornerstone of gameplay. Supervillain Labs aims to ensure all this happens with the robust transparency of blockchain transactions.Specifically, for the Sidekick Draw this time, we created a web dashboard where all draw attempts and their outcomes were recorded. The analysis of over 83,000 draws resulted in a 99% confidence interval for the Legendary drop rate. Anyone could verify the logic and draw results because we made use of the Aptos Roll, the on-chain randomness API developed by Aptos, the sources of which are open and accessible to anyone.Now that the event is over, the dashboard has a new look: Please take a look here if you\u2019re interested!Here is our roadmap, which provides an overview of what\u2019s happening at Supervillain Labs in the near future \u2014 and hopefully makes you feel excited about it!To be frank, we feel significant pressure once the assets we release gain real value on the market and people actually start to trade them. Planning is difficult, executing the plan is even more challenging. Without action, however, even the best plans are useless.We are carefully designing the Sidekick distribution: it is strategically planned to maintain asset value and adjust according to the increase in in-game users. While we will continue to be disruptive in presenting new models in web3 gaming, we promise to be careful in maintaining asset value, as it belongs to the community \u2014 not something we are allowed to deliberately touch or manipulate. But from the deepest bottom of our hearts, we sincerely hope that the games and content we provide bring true fun and value to you.Thank you so much for being part of our journey! See you again soon.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/resize:fill:160:107\/1*OkVFoD-jn8i9UJwjXoGCmw.png","author":"Supervillain Labs","title":"Supervillain Sidekicks\u200A\u2014\u200AWhat\u2019s Coming After the Sidekick Draw?","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@supervlabs\/supervillain-sidekicks-whats-coming-after-the-sidekick-draw-4e6deca52ef8","tags":[]},{"summary":"Developers on Merlin can now utilize dAPIs and OEV Network to power their applications.","date":null,"post_content":"We are excited to announce that API3\u2019s Oracle Stack is available on Merlin Chain, giving developers access to decentralized data feeds (dAPIs) and the soon to be launched OEV Network to recapture protocol MEV due to oracle updates. Developers on Merlin Chain can now access decentralized data feeds powered by first-party oracle nodes, which are operated directly by the data providers.With the launch of OEV Network later this month, protocols using API3\u2019s decentralized data feeds on Merlin Chain will have a vertically integrated solution for recapturing MEV. Rather than protocols leaking value to searchers and block builders, the proceeds from oracle update auctions are programmatically returned to the dApp where the value originated, leading to better execution for users and better protocol performance for dApps.Merlin Chain is a Bitcoin Layer 2 network that leverages the power of zk-technology to enhance the capabilities and functionalities of Bitcoin. Merlin Chain integrates a decentralized oracle network, data availability, and onchain BTC fraud proof modules to provide a secure and efficient network that simplifies Bitcoin adoption and fuels growth. With a core mission to \u201CMake Bitcoin Fun Again,\u201D Merlin Chain aims to expand the innovation from Bitcoin\u2019s Layer 1 to its Layer 2 by supporting native assets, protocols, and products. The network utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, which are submitted to Bitcoin for verification, and enables challengers to present fraud proofs to leverage Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism for dispute resolution. This ensures the security and economic efficiency of the network, promoting a high growth ecosystem for users.The infrastructure of Merlin Chain is built on Polygon\u2019s ZK-technology and is supplemented by Celestia\u2019s decentralized oracle network for enhanced data availability. It also incorporates Lumoz\u2019s decentralized computing power for zk-proof computations. Merlin Chain not only inherits the robust security of Bitcoin but also introduces significant scalability through batch processing at the Layer 2 level. As an EVM compatible L2, it supports the majority of existing smart contracts and developer tools, ensuring seamless interoperability across different platforms. Additionally, the use of zk-proofs, combined with zkSNARKs, minimizes space consumption on Layer 1, which significantly reduces transaction costs while achieving high performance through rapid network finality and scalable recursive STARK solutions.Developers looking to utilize dAPIs on Merlin Chain can visit the API3 Market. The API3 Market provides an easy way to browse, access, and manage a wide variety of data feeds, including crypto, forex, equities, and commodities. With the launch of OEV Network, developers will simply be able to read any data feed, enable OEV Network, and start earning.API3\u2019s first-party oracle architecture maintains data onchain directly from the data providers. This decentralized and verifiable design eliminates rent-seeking middlemen and offers a more secure and efficient method for bringing data onchain.One of the key benefits of dAPIs is the ease of use for dApps and chains requiring oracle services. Rather than having to manage their own infrastructure, dApps can simply read data that is natively maintained on Merlin Chain. This solution makes it easy for dApps to quickly and easily migrate to Merlin Chain from other EVM-compatible chains, allowing for the rapid adoption and scaling of DeFi ecosystems.API3\u2019s first-party oracle architecture leverages data directly from the source. The oracle nodes are operated by the data providers themselves, bringing cryptographically signed data onto the blockchain. This allows dAPIs to be verified down to the API parameters and aligns with core principles of the blockchain ethos of transparency and onchain verification.Protocols like Aave, Compound, and various DEXes all rely on data maintained directly on the consumer chain. API3 addresses this need by maintaining data on the native-chain in a verifiable and decentralized way. With the introduction of dAPIs on Merlin Chain, developers gain direct access to a wide assortment of real-world data, including crypto, forex, equities, and commodities straight from the source.DeFi protocols that rely on oracles leak a lot of MEV. For protocols like lending dApps, this amounts to millions of dollars a year.OEV Network creates an efficient market where oracle service providers and searchers come together to combat the negative impact of MEV through specialized order-flow auctions. With OEV Network, searchers don\u2019t need to wait for the price to update onchain, they can trigger the price update when it is most valuable. As an application-specific solution, it captures all the MEV created at the protocol level due to oracle updates and gives it back to the dApp that generated the value.OEV Network gives every lending and borrowing protocol on Merlin Chain a built-in MEV solution by improving upon critical inefficiencies in the current oracle design space. By leveraging the security of a zk-rollup to create an efficient market for oracle updates, it not only improves the health of lending and borrowing dApps but also allows them to capture a multi-million dollar opportunity.API3\u2019s oracle stack is easy to implement and offers a flexible, scalable solution for developers building on Merlin Chain. For those new to dAPIs, a developer Getting Started with dAPIs Video is available to guide you through the API3 Market.For more information about dAPIs or OEV Network, visit our website, follow us on Twitter, or explore the technical documentation.","post_cover":"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/v2\/da:true\/resize:fill:160:107\/0*A4_D9flmTiUC7XHH","author":"API3","title":"API3 Launches Next-Generation Oracle Stack on Merlin Chain","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/api3\/api3-launches-next-generation-oracle-stack-on-merlin-chain-e3ed78fc8a2a","tags":["Web3","Blockchain","Api3 Ecosystem","Oracle","Data"]},{"summary":"Mark your calendars for the \u20181000x Trading Competition\u2019, which will begin on April 29th at 00:00 UTC.

He\/SheThey\/It combined different technologies and ideas like cryptography, game theory, economics, and algorithms to achieve this breakthrough.When Bitcoin first emerged, people didn\u2019t refer to its underlying ledger technology as \u201Cblockchain.\u201D Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s creation allowed Bitcoin users to directly exchange digital currency without needing a centralised authority, like a bank, or a building society, or a checking account to verify transactions. This marked a significant advancement that earlier digital transaction systems hadn\u2019t accomplished.What is the difference between Bitcoin & Blockchain?Blockchain is like a digital ledger that records transactions or information. It\u2019s shared among many people, and once something is recorded, it\u2019s hard to change.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a type of digital currency that uses blockchain technology. It\u2019s one of the many things you can do with blockchain, like how email is one thing you can do with the internet. So, while Bitcoin uses blockchain, blockchain itself can be used for lots of other things besides Bitcoin.A bit more about Blockchain and how it works:A blockchain is helpful when many people need to agree on information. It\u2019s often used in places where people don\u2019t trust each other.People interact with the blockchain using their computers (called nodes). They help verify transactions and add them to the ledger, which is like a digital record book. This agreement process is called \u201Cconsensus,\u201D and there are different ways it can happen.Public blockchains are transparent, meaning anyone in the network can see what\u2019s written in the ledger. This openness allows people to verify transactions and see their order, making the blockchain both decentralised and transparent.What does the future hold for Blockchain tech?The future of blockchain holds immense potential for transforming various industries and aspects of our lives. Here are some possibilities:If you ever used decentralised technology, safeguarding your online presence is paramount. Always ensure you are using a VPN.
