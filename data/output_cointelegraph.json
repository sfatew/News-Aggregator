Here\u2019s how decentralization can help.","date":"2024-05-09","post_content":"Communication remains a basic necessity no matter how much humanity moves forward. The digital era has brought a myriad of online tools that bring people together, and it was a rather swift transition from postcards to Discord groups.\nInstant messaging applications with social elements, such as Slack, Discord or WhatsApp, operate as communication enablers for hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Both individuals and businesses utilize the rich features and ease of use found in such applications.\nHowever, as the power of communication becomes more concentrated under the hands of a few centralized services, a certain set of concerns arise:\nPrivacy and data security: Centralized platforms store user data on servers controlled by a single entity, making them attractive targets for hackers and raising concerns about how these companies use the data for advertising or other purposes.\nCensorship: Centralized entities can censor or moderate content according to their policies or external pressures, leading to arbitrary removal of content or entire communities.\nService outages: Centralization means that every user is affected if the service\u2019s servers go down. This creates a single point of failure.\nMonetization and advertisements: Centralized platforms may prioritize profit over user experience, leading to invasive advertising or selling user data to third parties.\nHow decentralization can improve digital communication\nDecentralized networks offer solutions to the biggest pain points of the Web2-era communication. Blockchain-based decentralization can potentially enhance privacy and security by distributing data across numerous points on the network, making it harder for unauthorized parties to access or compromise user information.\nWithout a centralized entity controlling the communication network, censorship and outage risks can be minimized. Thanks to the user-centric nature of Web3, it\u2019s also easier to enable new monetization models that empower participants.\nThe concept of a decentralized application (DApp) for instant messaging grew quickly over the years, giving birth to several examples. However, providing on-chain communication with Web2-like features is easier said than done. Most DApps that attempt to offer Web2-like features encounter significant hurdles.\nWhile decentralization enhances privacy and reduces censorship, it often comes at the cost of performance and user experience. For instance, achieving real-time communication \u2014 which is critical for user satisfaction in messaging apps \u2014 is more complex on a decentralized network due to increased latency and inconsistent data synchronization across nodes.\nFurthermore, most DApps compromise by handling user-facing, front-end features off-chain to maintain performance. This approach dilutes the principles of decentralization and limits the functionality and scalability of these applications. As a result, while DApps represent a promising frontier in digital communication, their current implementations are often incomplete and do not fully harness the advantages of blockchain technology.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nFully on-chain communication at scale\nOpenChat, a crypto messaging platform, aims to herald a new era in digital communication, leveraging the power of blockchain technology to deliver a unique, decentralized chatting experience. The platform promises enhanced security and autonomy for users, positioning them prominently in the development of Web3 and making it a relevant choice for those interested in the future of online interaction. OpenChat is running digital communication end-to-end \u2014 including front-end \u2014 on the Internet Computer (ICP).\nOpenChat is made possible by ICP, a blockchain network designed to expand the functionalities of the internet, offering a platform for smart contracts and DApps to run at web speed directly on the blockchain. ICP\u2019s unique infrastructure aims to unlock the full potential of DApps, helping them perform at traditional Web2 speeds while keeping the whole process on the blockchain.\nOpenChat provides Discord-like servers in a decentralized environment. Source: OpenChat\nRunning on ICP makes it possible for OpenChat to offer the same performance and feature set as Discord or Slack while providing full benefits of decentralization, including data security, reliability and censorship resistance. On top of traditional chat features, OpenChat is also equipped with crypto-native functionality, allowing users to send and receive tokens as chat messages and swap tokens either through integrations with exchanges or in a peer-to-peer fashion.\nThe communication DApp has recently introduced video and voice chat support, with the initial launch including one-to-one video calls in direct chats and group video calls of up to twenty people in private chats. OpenChat\u2019s phase two will target community broadcasts.\nWeb3 chat app governed by its users\nThe idea of decentralization and end-to-end on-chain communication offered by OpenChat has received a warm welcome from the ICP ecosystem. The project raised over 1 million ICP (worth $5.5 million at the time of fundraising) in five hours in March 2023 to become a fully functional decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) led by its community of shareholders.\nAs part of the ICP ecosystem, OpenChat is now controlled by a DAO and uses CHAT as its governance token. CHAT tokenholders will be able to govern the platform and make their voices heard regarding the future of OpenChat, Matt Grogan, co-founder of OpenChat, said at the time.\nOpenChat also offers a video chat feature. Source: OpenChat\nIn August, after the successful transition into a DAO, OpenChat enabled users to create Communities \u2014 servers with a Discord-meets-Slack style that enables group admins to create subgroups for more focused conversations. Users can find communities based on common interests or create their own. OpenChat co-founder Julian Jelfs shared plans to enable the OpenChat Communities feature for projects to integrate as a communication tool on their own websites.\nThe roadmap for decentralized communication\nOne of the primary goals of the DApp is to introduce end-to-end encryption for chats in 2024 to offer superior security and privacy. The roadmap of OpenChat also includes a sophisticated tokenization system to reward users for posting key content with CHAT tokens. The development team is fully pledged to keep pace with major Web2 competitors and lead innovation in Web3, meaning the feature set of OpenChat will evolve and expand as digital communication advances.\nOpenChat will be featured in the upcoming global ICPCC event on May 10, which will showcase how ICP technology can enhance decentralized applications on any blockchain.\nFully decentralized platforms like OpenChat aim to address the privacy, security and centralization challenges by offering enhanced privacy, reduced censorship and a user-governed ecosystem. It promises to safeguard user data and empower users through community-led governance and innovative monetization strategies planned for the future.\nLearn more about OpenChat\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#DAO\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

Protocols are governed by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), where each member holds voting power to approve or deny proposals and collectively shape a blockchain protocol's future.\nHowever, various smart contract setups may allow only a few wallets to obtain the majority of the voting power or take actions without community vote thanks to multisig use, undermining decentralization in the process. Internet Computer Protocol\u2019s (ICP) SNS framework allows for creating fully decentralized DAOs that give power back to the community.\nFrom event to DAO\nCentered around the ICP ecosystem, the ICP Community Conference (ICPCC) is a multichain event brand. It aims to host annual conferences to help the wider Web3 industry understand the basics of ICP and showcase its potential in integrating with and offering value to other popular chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\nSlated for May 10, ICPCC 2024 will be a global livestream accompanied by meetup watch parties organized in more than 25 cities worldwide. Content creators, live MCs, and innovators will present everything ICP has to offer the Web3 ecosystem.\nThe livestream is programmed in a way that spans prime times of all three fundamental time zones. The Asia-Pacific stage will witness a standalone ICPCC pre-party livestream that will be hosted by Yuku metaverse. The main 9-hour livestream will kick off in the European time zone and will be concluded in the United States primetime.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex\u2019s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: \u201CPulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.\u201D\n  Read more\nThis experimental event comes with the goal of taking decentralization to the next level. The whole event series will be launching into a DAO that will oversee the ICPCC brand from then on.\nLeadership as a service\nWithout a core or central team, the new DAO will be governed by elected council members. Collectively called the ICPCC Council, they are essentially paid vendors who are in charge of writing some of the more complex proposals that would be necessary for helping the DAO stay on track with its primary goals. This \u201Cleadership-as-a-service\u201D does not delegate council members any authority to act on behalf of the DAO. Instead, they are limited to simply preparing high-quality proposals, while other DAO members can elect and remove council members directly.\nAs an SNS DAO, the new organization leverages unique features that strengthen decentralization and streamline participation. All components of decentralized apps (DApps) \u2014 including front end, back end and data \u2014 are on blockchain and, therefore, the DAO can exercise full control over every aspect of a DApp via voting. Moreover, front-end interactions do not require any gas fees, effectively removing a significant barrier to blockchain-based development.\nThere will be no multisig or custodians for the treasury wallet, leaving it completely under the control of the organization that will manage it in a gasless affordable environment.\nBe part of the biggest user onboarding wave since ICP Genesis.\n\nJust dropped: Our first official presentation of #ICPCC24!🔥\n\nExpect talks, demos, airdrops, giveaways, meetups & more!\n\nMay 10 awaits.

Hence, the DAO is registered as Marshall Islands DAO LLC, which empowers it as a legal entity that can legally sign contracts and manage IP exclusively through on-chain proposals. The annual registration fee will be paid directly in USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\n, a milestone for crypto adoption.\nAttendees to become owners\nDebuted last year, the ICPCC is already transforming into a major event series. It is currently organized by Code & State, an ICP-focused venture studio, which has already delegated all rights related to ICPP. The decentralized organization will then vote to elect council members who will submit proposals.\nRegarding the takeover, Isaac Valadez, the venture lead at Code & State, commented:\n\u201CThis won\u2019t be our DAO. The ICP community really is taking over total control. This is a major Web3 event series converting into a protocol that needs no custodians or centralized dependencies, and it\u2019s an experiment that could outlast all of us.\u201D\nApart from hosting a live DAO launch, the event will also provide chances to win airdrops of a wide range of tokens and NFTs. Party-goers and livestream listeners who enter airdrop codes will be whitelisted for future airdrop allocations. Starting from 2025, ICPCC DAO LLC will also host an annual in-person conference.\nLearn more about the ICPCC\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Adoption\n#DAO\n#Internet Computer\nDisclaimer.

Here\u2019s how decentralization can help.","date":"2024-05-09","post_content":"Communication remains a basic necessity no matter how much humanity moves forward. The digital era has brought a myriad of online tools that bring people together, and it was a rather swift transition from postcards to Discord groups.\nInstant messaging applications with social elements, such as Slack, Discord or WhatsApp, operate as communication enablers for hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Both individuals and businesses utilize the rich features and ease of use found in such applications.\nHowever, as the power of communication becomes more concentrated under the hands of a few centralized services, a certain set of concerns arise:\nPrivacy and data security: Centralized platforms store user data on servers controlled by a single entity, making them attractive targets for hackers and raising concerns about how these companies use the data for advertising or other purposes.\nCensorship: Centralized entities can censor or moderate content according to their policies or external pressures, leading to arbitrary removal of content or entire communities.\nService outages: Centralization means that every user is affected if the service\u2019s servers go down. This creates a single point of failure.\nMonetization and advertisements: Centralized platforms may prioritize profit over user experience, leading to invasive advertising or selling user data to third parties.\nHow decentralization can improve digital communication\nDecentralized networks offer solutions to the biggest pain points of the Web2-era communication. Blockchain-based decentralization can potentially enhance privacy and security by distributing data across numerous points on the network, making it harder for unauthorized parties to access or compromise user information.\nWithout a centralized entity controlling the communication network, censorship and outage risks can be minimized. Thanks to the user-centric nature of Web3, it\u2019s also easier to enable new monetization models that empower participants.\nThe concept of a decentralized application (DApp) for instant messaging grew quickly over the years, giving birth to several examples. However, providing on-chain communication with Web2-like features is easier said than done. Most DApps that attempt to offer Web2-like features encounter significant hurdles.\nWhile decentralization enhances privacy and reduces censorship, it often comes at the cost of performance and user experience. For instance, achieving real-time communication \u2014 which is critical for user satisfaction in messaging apps \u2014 is more complex on a decentralized network due to increased latency and inconsistent data synchronization across nodes.\nFurthermore, most DApps compromise by handling user-facing, front-end features off-chain to maintain performance. This approach dilutes the principles of decentralization and limits the functionality and scalability of these applications. As a result, while DApps represent a promising frontier in digital communication, their current implementations are often incomplete and do not fully harness the advantages of blockchain technology.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nFully on-chain communication at scale\nOpenChat, a crypto messaging platform, aims to herald a new era in digital communication, leveraging the power of blockchain technology to deliver a unique, decentralized chatting experience. The platform promises enhanced security and autonomy for users, positioning them prominently in the development of Web3 and making it a relevant choice for those interested in the future of online interaction. OpenChat is running digital communication end-to-end \u2014 including front-end \u2014 on the Internet Computer (ICP).\nOpenChat is made possible by ICP, a blockchain network designed to expand the functionalities of the internet, offering a platform for smart contracts and DApps to run at web speed directly on the blockchain. ICP\u2019s unique infrastructure aims to unlock the full potential of DApps, helping them perform at traditional Web2 speeds while keeping the whole process on the blockchain.\nOpenChat provides Discord-like servers in a decentralized environment. Source: OpenChat\nRunning on ICP makes it possible for OpenChat to offer the same performance and feature set as Discord or Slack while providing full benefits of decentralization, including data security, reliability and censorship resistance. On top of traditional chat features, OpenChat is also equipped with crypto-native functionality, allowing users to send and receive tokens as chat messages and swap tokens either through integrations with exchanges or in a peer-to-peer fashion.\nThe communication DApp has recently introduced video and voice chat support, with the initial launch including one-to-one video calls in direct chats and group video calls of up to twenty people in private chats. OpenChat\u2019s phase two will target community broadcasts.\nWeb3 chat app governed by its users\nThe idea of decentralization and end-to-end on-chain communication offered by OpenChat has received a warm welcome from the ICP ecosystem. The project raised over 1 million ICP (worth $5.5 million at the time of fundraising) in five hours in March 2023 to become a fully functional decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) led by its community of shareholders.\nAs part of the ICP ecosystem, OpenChat is now controlled by a DAO and uses CHAT as its governance token. CHAT tokenholders will be able to govern the platform and make their voices heard regarding the future of OpenChat, Matt Grogan, co-founder of OpenChat, said at the time.\nOpenChat also offers a video chat feature. Source: OpenChat\nIn August, after the successful transition into a DAO, OpenChat enabled users to create Communities \u2014 servers with a Discord-meets-Slack style that enables group admins to create subgroups for more focused conversations. Users can find communities based on common interests or create their own. OpenChat co-founder Julian Jelfs shared plans to enable the OpenChat Communities feature for projects to integrate as a communication tool on their own websites.\nThe roadmap for decentralized communication\nOne of the primary goals of the DApp is to introduce end-to-end encryption for chats in 2024 to offer superior security and privacy. The roadmap of OpenChat also includes a sophisticated tokenization system to reward users for posting key content with CHAT tokens. The development team is fully pledged to keep pace with major Web2 competitors and lead innovation in Web3, meaning the feature set of OpenChat will evolve and expand as digital communication advances.\nOpenChat will be featured in the upcoming global ICPCC event on May 10, which will showcase how ICP technology can enhance decentralized applications on any blockchain.\nFully decentralized platforms like OpenChat aim to address the privacy, security and centralization challenges by offering enhanced privacy, reduced censorship and a user-governed ecosystem. It promises to safeguard user data and empower users through community-led governance and innovative monetization strategies planned for the future.\nLearn more about OpenChat\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#DAO\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

The BNR is considering a national digital currency that incorporates the latest innovations in the technology and is highly tailored to local conditions.\nA retail CBDC would advance Rwanda\u2019s cashless economy national initiative and increase the resilience of the financial system, which is still subject to frequent power outages, the BNR found. The central bank expects to spend $35 million on printing and maintaining its cash supply in the next five years despite its cashless goal.\nThe BNR is proposing an interest-free, intermediated CBDC with interoperability with all the country\u2019s existing payment systems and potentially other CBDCs after the appropriate amendments to the country\u2019s Central Bank Act are made. It recommended a token-based, rather than account-based, model with open programmability and smart contracts.\nTokenization would allow digital cash to be transferred offline using Bluetooth or near-field communication (NFC) technology and would not require a smartphone. This is in contrast to current electronic payment options.\nProgrammability would be a mixed blessing, the study noted:\n\u201CThe advantages of open programmability, which facilitates value-added innovative products and services, are expected to outweigh the arguments of privacy and security.\u201D\nThe BNR foresaw no more than \u201Cpartial pseudo-anonymity\u201D for the CBDC.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nRelated: BIS issues comprehensive paper on offline CBDC payments\nPayment service providers currently make up less than 0.9% of the Rwandan financial sector.

Proof-of-Inference allows miners to provide predictions along with ZK proofs to ensure computational integrity, confirming their predictions were run on a specific model directly on the blockchain.\nBy rewarding miners who deliver the most accurate predictions and verifiable models, the subnet ensures optimal performance for its use cases. Inference Labs aims to enhance the Bittensor economic system by introducing a market-driven approach to incentivize miners based on their performance and the volume of on-chain verifiable transactions.\nMerging allocation strategies and AI\nAdditionally, Inference Labs introduced Omron.ai to address the complex challenge of optimizing staked allocations across Actively Validated Services (AVS) through the application of artificial intelligence (AI).\nOmron offers a practical solution to selecting the most advantageous AVS among potentially tens of thousands of options by considering a variety of risk factors, including changes in AVS rewards as more operators enter the market and their effects on risk-adjusted yields. As Omron begins to receive payments and slashing data, the subnet will be well-positioned to integrate this real-time data, ensuring that these models provide a more accurate depiction of yield.\nOmron allows users to stake their digital assets like Ether\nETH\n$3,032\nand earn rewards through their choice of Liquid Restaking (LRT) protocol. For example, Renzo converts staked ETH or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) into a new type of tradable token that continues to earn rewards. These tokens are also used within the Ethereum network to gain additional financial returns and provide vital data for AI training on the Bittensor network.\nOmron operates through a complex system of smart contracts, Bittensor validators and mining nodes, which are computers that process the computationally intensive requirements of Inference and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. The Bittensor economic model incentivized the creation of Subnet 2, a powerful zero-knowledge machine learning (ZK-ML) compute cluster.\nThe Bittensor decentralized network allows machine learning models to exchange and monetize on a blockchain platform. On the Bittensor, nodes that host these models serve requests for AI services and earn crypto in return for their computational contributions.\nInference Labs\u2019 strategic integration of AI and blockchain through the innovative Proof-of-Inference mechanism and the successful pre-seed funding round marks a forward-thinking step toward democratizing AI technology and ensuring its development is equitable, accessible and protected from monopolistic tendencies with sovereignty.\nLearn more about Inference Labs and Omron\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Funding\n#AI\n#Web3\n#Staking\nDisclaimer.

It could bring in \u201Cbillions of new [blockchain] users.\u201D","date":"2024-05-08","post_content":"\u201CSmart contract programming is hard,\u201D said Emin Gün Sirer, founder of Ava Labs, which built the Avalanche blockchain. Capturing \u201Cintent\u201D is difficult. Coding is tricky. Verification remains a challenge. \n\u201CThis is the main problem that is keeping smart contracts from flourishing,\u201D added Sirer, speaking at the recent Cornell Blockchain Conference in New York City.\nBut imagine if artificial intelligence (AI) \u201Cagents\u201D like ChatGPT or Llama could do all that smart contract coding for you. Lawyers, as opposed to coders, might soon become the dominant writers of smart contracts.\nEven more interesting, everyday people would be able to write smart contracts in their native language \u2014 peer-to-peer \u2014 almost as easily as they write bank checks today.\nThat is the future, suggested Sirer at the April 26 event held at Cornell Tech\u2019s stunning Roosevelt Island campus in New York City, further explaining:\n\u201CAll of you are familiar with writing checks, right? That\u2019s the maximum complexity instrument that my retail bank offers to me. At present, you have few options. You can write a check to \u2018John\u2019 that essentially says \u2018I hereby transfer to John $5,000\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s about it.\u201D\nBut suppose that you could do the same thing but add additional instructions, Sirer continued, for example:\n\u201C\u2018I hereby give John $5,000 if and only if he can collect $5 million by the end of September to film a movie. And if he can\u2019t do it, then I want my money back.\u2019 I can just write this.\u201D\nSirer said the scenario he envisions is still five to 10 years away, but if and when it does come, it will be \u201Ctransformative.\u201D\nWe would \u201Cbe able to onboard billions of new [blockchain] users.\u201D\nAt present, most smart contracts are written in Solidity, a computer language that remains obscure even among programmers.\nBut Avalanche has begun building a new virtual machine at the intersection of AI and blockchains, Sirer said, which is \u201Cprogrammed in a natural language. You write your programs in English, German, French, Tagalog, Chinese [...] a natural language that your mother taught you in your mother\u2019s tongue.\u201D\nQuestions remain\nBut is all this just pie in the sky? Many issues need to be resolved before these \u201Ccoin-operated agents,\u201D as Sirer calls them, can be widely deployed.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex\u2019s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: \u201CPulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.\u201D\n  Read more\nLegalities need to be worked out. Keywords and terms will have to be defined unambiguously. A word like \u201Csoftware,\u201D for instance, might have to be very carefully defined before it can be used in smart contracts involving software licenses. All this could take some time.\nRecent: EU crypto regulations undermined by lack of enforcement, say observers\nThen, too, AI \u201Cagents\u201D may not be quite ready to write legally binding documents. Large language models (LLMs) can \u201Challucinate,\u201D after all.\n\u201CEverybody has seen [AI-generated] pictures of seven-fingered people,\u201D Sirer noted.\nBut there are short-term solutions for some of these problems. One could submit transactions to both ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama, for example, requiring both agents to agree before a smart contract solution is accepted. \u201CSo that way, at least, you get two trusted executors, and you are taking the intersection of their actions.\u201D\n\u201CPlain English instructions\u201D for smart contracts\nOthers suggest that smart contracts that can handle \u201Cnatural\u201D language are already here \u2014 or at least close at hand.\n\u201CThe capability to allow every individual to be their own programmer exists in the world today,\u201D Sam Friedman, principal solutions architect at Chainlink Labs, told Cointelegraph.\nFriedman cited Council, the AI agent framework developed by ChainML, a project in the Chainlink BUILD program, that \u201Cenables developers to provide plain English instructions immediately converted into executable code. Today, that code is mostly Python or SQL. But enabling smart contracts is an upgrade away.\u201D\nHe also mentioned Chainlink Developer Hub\u2019s \u201CAsk AI,\u201D which can return a fully formed smart contract when a user submits a request in plain English, something on the order of: \u201CShow me an example smart contract that enables a user to request a random number between one and ten. It should use Chainlink VRF.\u201D\nToday\u2019s offerings probably don\u2019t have the full functionality that Sirer envisions, however, and Friedman told Cointelegraph that a lot of work lies ahead.\n\u201CWhile AI agents writing smart contracts are already here, this isn\u2019t their final form,\u201D he said. They will still need to improve in terms of quality and complexity. \u201CAI models need to be trained with ever-newer content for this to happen.\u201D\nStill, Friedman can imagine use cases where multiple AI \u201Cagents\u201D with distinct roles collaborate to complete the lifecycle management of a smart contract. For instance:\n\u201COne agent helps define the requirements, another writes the smart contract, another performs quality and security testing, another deploys the contracts, and the last one performs ongoing maintenance or tuning of the parameters or global variables in the contract after it\u2019s deployed.\u201D\nThere are still \u201Cbig unknowns,\u201D Sirer acknowledged at the Cornell Tech conference, and moving the needle forward will require guidance from all sorts of individuals, \u201Cpeople with both a technology and an ethics and a humanities background.\u201D\nA place for lawyers, too?\nIn a question period following his presentation, Sirer was asked who would write smart contracts if Solidity was no longer required and coding could be done in ASCII text.\nSource: SV\n\u201CWho are going to be the best programmers for this?\u201D At first glance, software programmers would seem to have the edge. They are already skilled in defining and specifying conditions in precise language, after all.\nRecent: Where to store your crypto: Wallets provide diverse options for holders\n\u201CBut the people who know how to use regular language for specifying contracts are the lawyers. So they are going to be the kings and queens of that universe [\u2026] the ones who really figure out how to flourish in this system.\u201D\nAnd average users? \u201CI think they are quite capable of specifying basic transactions,\u201D Sirer said. Indeed, he foresees these new capabilities being built on \u201Cdemocratic, open platforms\u201D that \u201Canyone can use on an equal footing.\u201D\nOverall, this new approach to smart contracts is so interesting and full of promise \u201Cthat we can\u2019t just leave it on the table,\u201D Sirer concluded.\nExchange or buy AVAX\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

The company covers alpha primary and secondary investment layouts of projects from different scales in varying ecological niches.\nIn this interview, FutureMoney Group co-founders Steven Li and Eo Hao draw an insightful image of the current DePIN landscape and how it can expand the Web3 space.\nCointelegraph: How do you see the current state of the DePIN ecosystem?\nSteven Li: FutureMoney Group has been focusing on the DePIN area and has invested in many portfolios. We have tried our best to cover the different subdivisions of the DePIN sector so we have a more intuitive understanding of the development of the DePIN ecosystem. \nThe DePIN ecosystem mainly has the following characteristics: \nDePIN is an important starting point and manifestation of the extension of the Web3 field to the traditional world.\nCompared with other popular tracks such as Bitcoin (BTC) ecology, including layers, modular blockchains and restake, DePIN is the easiest to be accepted by traditional funds and understood by traditional users.\nThe DePIN and AI tracks mostly overlap, and there is a tendency for the tracks to merge.\nDePIN is closely integrated with hardware. Currently, the main focus is on the mobile terminal, vehicle terminal and mining machine terminal.\nThe narrative of DePIN is mainly the combination of hardware and token economics. By adding the AI track and emphasizing the staking function, DePINFi and AIFi will explode in the future, with DePIN as the core.\nCT: FutureMoney Group is known as the first VC focusing on the DePIN field in Asia, closing a $20 million fund to invest in DePIN-related products and services. What has attracted the FutureMoney Group to the DePIN space?\nEo Hao: The reason why we chose DePIN is that, on the one hand, we believe that after experiencing multiple rounds of bull markets, the overall market value of Web3 has expanded several times, and the Bitcoin ETF has been passed, the possibility and necessity of being connected to the real world has become imminent.\nDePIN is a good starting point and expression that combines the two worlds. On the other hand, because some of the LPs behind us include the largest hardware manufacturers in the Asian market, including electric vehicle manufacturing companies and mining farms listed in the United States, we pay special attention to the upstream and downstream related to blockchain and hardware.\nEO is sharing DePIN opportunities on Web3 festival 2024. Source: FutureMoney Group\nCT: Could you share the story of the FutureMoney Group? When did you establish the company?\nSL: Co-founder Eo Hao and I started to invest in blockchain and encryption projects in 2016. In addition to buying BTC and Ether (ETH), we are also individual investors in BAT, Loopring, Qtum and other projects. After experiencing the ICO craze in 2017, we started investing in early crypto projects in early 2018 with a total of $1.5 million from our family, friends and our own savings.\nThe two co-founders of FutureMoney Group are Eo Hao and Steven Li. Source: FutureMoney Group\nAlthough this amount cannot be counted as our official first fund, we started from a personal landmark event when an investor transformed into a company.\nCT: What was your initial goal when starting FutureMoney Group, and what are your goals now?\nSL: Because Eo and I both have financial technology backgrounds, our initial interest in blockchain technology also came from the belief that it would revolutionize the financial system. We established this fund to find the next generation of \u201Cmoney\" through investment, so the company Named FutureMoney.\nAfter several years of development and upgrading, we have developed from the initial venture capital business to a holding company in the crypto field covering asset management, mining, fund of funds and incubators, so after 2021, we officially changed the company name to FutureMoney Group. We hope to continue supporting early-stage startups by delving deeper into the crypto field through our methods while opening the window for more Asian investors to allocate crypto assets.\nCT: Where does FutureMoney Group stand now? Could you detail your investment practices and portfolio?\nEH: Our current investment theme is the Future of Work. As mentioned, FMG is the most professional investment institution on the DePIN track. Messari has included us, and DePIN Buddy has listed us as one of the most professional investment institutions on the DePIN track. Together with Borderless, Multicoin is equally famous.\nOur expertise is reflected in the depth and breadth of our DePIN Portfolio layout. We have three products:\nDePIN Surf focuses on very early and low-market-value Alpha projects.

The blockchain space is getting crowded and complex day by day, with no sign of cooling down, all the while gaining wider mainstream traction with each bullish trend.\nAs a matter of course, the growth of the blockchain ecosystem is accompanied by the constant emergence of new use cases. Blockchain\u2019s full potential may be achieved when the technology is applied in varying fields, which highlights the urgent need for different blockchains to be interoperable.\nHowever, blockchains do not have the ability to work interoperable intrinsically. Lack of interoperability leads to uncertainties for businesses and users, discouraging them from interacting with blockchains and hindering the technologies\u2019 adoption.\nLack of interoperability\nThe fragmentation in the space is a challenge for developers as well. A research shows that developing a basic blockchain application takes more than three months on average, and things get tougher when it comes to interoperable applications. There is not an established standard of systems and languages between technologies.\nMoreover, the novelty of the space means there are fewer experienced developers than in traditional industries, even though building a cross-chain application from scratch requires intensive knowledge of all chains included and powerful tools to support developers in their endeavors.\nAddressing these challenges is essential for blockchain to achieve its full potential as a game-changer technology and be adopted within mainstream industries. Omnichain solutions like Dojima target the aforementioned issues by employing a holistic approach to blockchain development.\nUniversal omnichain layer for all blockchains\nDojima is a cross-chain platform that unites numerous protocols with varying architecture and consensus mechanisms. It offers a universal layer where both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM chains like Bitcoin can interact.\nThe platform focuses on creating an omnichain hub on which all kinds of blockchains \u2014 proof-of-work or proof-of-stake \u2014 coexist and seamlessly integrate them for both developers and users. By pooling assets and data from different chains, Dojima simplifies the development and deployment of complex cross-chain applications.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThe omnichain layer-1 platform places robust infrastructure development at the center of its business and offers unique tools to foster adoption. The developer dashboard, named Magic Dashboard, includes templates for building a wide range of products, such as Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and a deposit manager.\nDevelopment in minutes\nTo eliminate the need to start from scratch for developers, Dojima provides templates that reduce the time to build and deploy omnichain applications from months to less than 5 minutes. By lowering the technical knowledge barrier, the platform also offers a starting place for less tech-savvy developers.\nAn innovative business model, which Dojima calls Functionality-as-a-Service (FaaS), aids such users when developing and using DApp. It is an omnichain API service that interacts and gets data from all integrated chains. FaaS helps ecosystem participants with tasks varying from creating an account and signing transactions to setting gas rates.\nTo make navigation through connected chains easier, Dojima built an omnichain explorer. Just like traditional blockchain scanners, the service functions as a search engine and allows users to access and track transactions on the network.\nDojima offers an omnichain explorer for a holistic view of the blockchain space.\nThe protocol incorporates a cryptocurrency wallet as well. Designed to enable cross-chain interactions between integrated platforms, the Dojima wallet enables users to store, send, receive and swap tokens across different chains, including prominent blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\nDojima is also creating secondary marketplaces for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and derivatives in an effort to attract the users of connected blockchains. The project strives to be a robust, scalable and user-friendly platform that fosters liquidity, development and collaboration.\nBuilding a metaverse in a day\nDojima activated its testnet in late 2022 to let users and developers test the network, which coincided with hackathons organized by the team to attract talent in the space. One outstanding project was a metaverse created in less than a day, where users can buy multiple NFTs with tokens native to Dojima through a VR headset. Throughout 2023, the project expanded its community before jumping on the next step.\nDojima recently launched its stagenet - the alpha version of its mainnet - and temporarily opened up the faucet, a web-based service that sends test tokens to users for experimental use. The stagenet received interaction from more than one hundred unique wallets on its first day. Next for Dojima is the launch of its native token, which is slated for the third quarter.\n\u201COur vision is to be the cornerstone of the Web3 evolution,\u201D Dojima says in its vision statement. The team aims to establish Dojima Network as \u201Cthe go-to cross-chain platform that seamlessly connects diverse blockchain networks.\u201D\n\u201CBy continually attracting top talent and leveraging support from industry leaders, we aim to revolutionize how developers, users and protocols interact and expand within the blockchain universe, making Dojima Network synonymous with innovation, collaboration, and growth in the Web3 space.\u201D\nBy creating a marketplace for diverse blockchains, providing powerful tools and simplifying the building process, Dojima envisions a future where its solution becomes the standard for blockchain interoperability.\nLearn more about Dojima\n#Blockchain\n#Cryptocurrencies\n#Decentralization\n#Adoption\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.

Kelp offers a compelling answer with a blend of blockchain, on-chain data, and monetary theorem.","date":"2024-05-07","post_content":"With traditional fiat currencies facing inflation concerns and the volatility of cryptocurrencies posing a challenge, Kelp offers a novel solution. CEO and co-founder Edward Bishop discussed Kelp's unique monetary policy-based approach during Cointelegraph's recent AMA.\nKelp AMA - Achieving Stability in Crypto https:\/\/t.co\/Cuu1nDfjIR\n\u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 22, 2024\n\"We're neither a traditional fiat-backed stablecoin nor an algorithmic coin, but rather a flatcoin,\" Bishop said, describing the essence of Kelp. \"It's a hybrid of the two that adjusts its supply to inflation in the real economy and maintains its purchasing power over time. We use a monetary theory called the quantity theory of money. It is codified in our protocol, which monitors economic activity and predicts the ideal circulating supply to maintain price stability.\"\nThe Kelp Protocol, at the heart of the Kelp ecosystem, uses various economic indicators to understand market conditions. For example, if Kelp experiences rapid price increases, the protocol could adjust supply to reduce volatility.\nCurrently, Kelp is in a seed phase, which Bishop described as \"very experimental.\" He identified two main goals for this phase: to reach parity with the U.S. dollar and to ensure a minimum amount of coins are in circulation. Once these goals are achieved, the price is expected to find equilibrium and fluctuate naturally. The price range may adjust based on market demand, and may expand as demand for Kelp increases.\nBishop mentioned several levers to achieve these goals: \"We have different systems to get there. For example, staking helps us temporarily lock up supply. Basically, it incentivizes users to hold $KELP instead of trading it, effectively reducing the amount of supply in circulation. On the other hand, we have a variable taker fee, which is tied to the liquidity pool and increases when the price goes down.\"\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nHe then delved into the seed phase they're going through: \"Part of the initial phase is getting Kelp Protocol to make accurate predictions, so we do a lot of simulations to figure out what the expected effect is. There are algorithms that determine interest rates and token release strategy, which is our guiding protocol for the seed phase. For people who want to sell, we have Liquidity Guard. If we take these three emission sources and then use the difference between what the Kelp Protocol tells us and what our supply should be, and use it to modify different variables in our ecosystem, we can achieve our short-term goals.\nBishop described the Liquidity Guard as a smart contract that allows users in challenging situations to sell their Kelp holdings through the contract at an optimal time, bypassing the variable taker fee. In return, Kelp manages the sale responsibly to minimize market impact. The contract prioritizes user needs with different fee tiers based on urgency.\nCompared to traditional central banks, Bishop highlighted Kelp's quicker adjustments because Kelp uses on-chain data, allowing for faster and more accurate monitoring of economic activity. At the same time, he acknowledged the need for a delicate balance, as overreaction can be detrimental. In the event of extreme market volatility, Kelp can use collateralized assets as a backstop, similar to how central banks conduct open market operations, meaning Kelp can perform buybacks to stabilize the price during a crash.\nAccording to Bishop, Kelp prioritizes building a large user base and targets 1-2 million users for the official launch. They are allocating 25 billion Kelp tokens through the Kelp Reservation Program, which can be earned through referrals or by completing gamified tasks. All of this is available through the Kelp app, which also serves as a self-custodial Web3 wallet.\nBishop also mentioned an upcoming feature for the Kelp app - K.A.T.E, an algorithmic trading engine. It will analyze users' risk profiles and investment goals, and use hedge fund algorithms to create personalized investment portfolios that suggest assets (crypto, stocks, or both) to buy and hold.\nKelp is currently in its third round of pre-sales.

This process is also how new Bitcoin are added to the existing supply.\nThere are currently around 19.5 million Bitcoin in circulation and the cryptocurrency is programmed to have a total supply of 21 million. The final 1.5 million or so are locked away, waiting for users with powerful computers to release them through Bitcoin mining.\nBitcoin mining is like a digital treasure hunt. Armed with powerful computer hardware, miners search for a 64-digit hexadecimal code that validates a block of transactions. This code (also called a hash) is found through a process called hashing. \nHashing requires computer hardware to sift through trillions of hashes to find one that matches a block\u2019s difficulty (also called target hash). Once miners find a block\u2019s target hash, they can verify its transactions are genuine and will issue a block confirmation. The network then releases more Bitcoin (BTC).\nFinding the target hash can take miners a long time. The amount of time varies based on many factors, such as the Bitcoin network\u2019s current mining difficulty. A difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks and raises or lowers based on the number of miners contributing. More miners means a higher difficulty, while fewer miners means a lower difficulty. \nMining rigs abide by Bitcoin\u2019s mining algorithm, SHA-256. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function used in password hashing and digital signature verification, among other applications. In the case of Bitcoin, it is used for hashing.\nA new block is mined every 10 minutes, and the network releases a fixed amount of Bitcoin and distributes it to miners. This release of Bitcoin is called a block reward. Before the Bitcoin halving in April 2024, the block reward was 6.25 per block. The Bitcoin halving event reduced this reward to 3.125 Bitcoin, with halvings occurring roughly every four years. This halving process was programmed by Bitcoin\u2019s creator and is designed to create digital scarcity and maintain the value of Bitcoin, which also dramatically affects mining profitability.\nBitcoin\u2019s creator programmed the network to halve every 210,000 blocks (around every four years) to create digital scarcity. At this rate, Bitcoin won\u2019t hit its 21 million cap until 2140.\nAt that point, miners will still earn rewards through transaction fees but will no longer release new Bitcoin into the network.\nWhat\u2019s the average time needed to mine a single Bitcoin?\nThe length of time it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin can vary.\nEach committed Bitcoin block releases 3.125 Bitcoin. To answer the central question in mind, it takes an average of 10 minutes to mine not just 1 Bitcoin but 3 \u2014 and that rate will fluctuate over time. But, due to the massive amount of computing power it takes to mine a single block (otherwise known as block time), it\u2019s almost impossible for one miner to receive all 3.125 of the reward.\nHow long does it take for one person to mine 1 Bitcoin? This number will range significantly due to the miner\u2019s hardware. For example, some miners have dozens, if not hundreds, of pieces of mining hardware in an attempt to increase their hash rate. In that case, they will likely earn more Bitcoin per block than other miners with a lower hash rate. Many miners join a mining pool to contribute to Bitcoin mining in a meaningful way.\nA mining pool is a group of miners all contributing their hash rate as one entity in hopes of finding a target hash. In doing so, miners earn rewards based on their hash rate contribution.\nRewards are distributed by a mining pool operator, who often charges a mining pool fee. However, miners can contribute to different types of mining pools.\nProportional\nA proportional mining pool distributes rewards based on a miner\u2019s hash rate contribution. They can also earn additional rewards through transaction fees.\nPay per last N groups\nPay per last N groups mining pools distribute miners into shifts and pay them out based on their time on \u201Cshift.\u201D A shift is a set period in which the miner contributes to the mining pool.\nPay-per-share\nPay-per-share pools provide miners with a fixed income, expecting them to contribute a certain amount of their hash rate daily. While this is a stable way to mine Bitcoin, it removes a miner\u2019s ability to earn transaction fees.\nHow hard is it to solo mine Bitcoin?\nSolo mining Bitcoin involves one miner competing with every other miner globally. \nBitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol makes mining a natural competition. The chances of a solo miner beating the rest of the world to a block\u2019s target hash are nearly zero \u2014 no matter their mining rigs\u2019 power.\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s early days, mining difficulty was relatively low due to the lack of miners. Block rewards were also much higher, with miners earning dozens of Bitcoin per block. However, Bitcoin was worth less than $1 back then, so the reward was a bit more fitting.\nPresently, solo miners join cryptocurrency mining pools to have any chance of earning rewards from Bitcoin mining. Potential miners without a powerful mining rig can also join a cloud mining service to save on the initial investment cost. \nCloud mining services consist of miners leasing out their hashing power via the cloud and asking users to pay for a share of it. As a result, the miners offload some energy consumption costs to paying users. In return, paying users earn block rewards based on their share of hashing power.\nHow to earn 1 Bitcoin per day without investment?\nIt takes money to make money. Earning Bitcoin without investment is nearly impossible, but there are inexpensive ways to get involved.\nIt is nearly impossible to earn 1 Bitcoin per day without investment. Bitcoin mining requires energy consumption, which miners pay through their electricity bills. Moreover, Bitcoin mining is intended to get harder and harder over time. It requires a lot of electricity and specialized, pricey hardware. \nIt is almost hard for an individual to mine 1 Bitcoin per day, even with substantial expenditure. Anyone wishing to mine Bitcoin would have to compete with powerful mining operations, with their economies of scale giving them a significant competitive edge over individual miners.\nAs of May 6, 2024, 1 Bitcoin is worth $64,116. Earning this much daily without investment would heavily destabilize the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, beware of websites or programs claiming to help you earn 1 Bitcoin daily for free. These are often scams designed to exploit people looking for quick returns.\nThose looking to invest in crypto mining should first learn about crypto trading, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets. Over time, they might be able to turn minor investments into larger sums of money with the right information and approaches.","post_cover":null,"author":"by Max Moeller","title":"How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin?","url":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/explained\/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-1-bitcoin","tags":[]},{"summary":"Kronos Research was exploited for $25 million in November 2023, with one of the six wallets linked to the hacker moving funds to Tornado Cash on May 7.","date":"2024-05-07","post_content":"The hacker behind the $25 million exploit of quantitative trading firm Kronos Research in mid-November 2023 started moving funds nearly six months after the exploit.\nThe hacker wallet first transferred 1,314 Ether\nETH\n$3,033\nworth $4 million to a new address, starting with 0x8F5e4 and later transferred all the ETH to another address starting with 0x164A24b.\nSource: PeckShield\nThe hacker made 10 transactions of 100 ETH from the final wallet and transferred it to Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing tool.\nThe hacker made several transfers to Tornado Cash.

Combining AI with Web3 data and wallet analytics has the potential to prevent bots and token farmers who have no interest in the project from impacting the related airdrop campaign.\nOne such project using AI-powered analytics to incentivize genuine community interaction is Cookie3, an AI data layer designed for the MarketingFi space.\nCookie3 is a strategic partner of Cookie DAO, a collective of MarketingFi enthusiasts banded together to bolster decentralization through innovative blockchain solutions. Issued by Cookie DAO, the COOKIE3 token finds its utility in the AI-powered MarketingFi ecosystem built by Cookie3.\nThe Cookie3 ecosystem aims to deliver a transparent marketing economy by adding an AI data layer to MarketingFi campaigns, unlocking value for stakeholders \u2014 users, creators and businesses \u2014 of the Web3 ecosystem.\nCookie3 seeks to deliver value for businesses, creators and users in MarketingFi campaigns. Source: Cookie3\nTaking a cue from the success of recent Web3 campaigns, Cookie3 aims to become a cornerstone in the evolution of MarketingFi by combining the elements of social farming (or rather engagement since the project puts emphasis on sparking and rewarding quality conversations, giving no place for mindless farming and spamming) with referrals, key opinion leader (KOL) engagement, analytics and AI data layer to promote the airdrop for the Cookie DAO and COOKIE, the upcoming native token of the Cookie ecosystem.\nConducted by the Cookie DAO, the COOKIE token airdrop will leverage Cookie3\u2019s MarketingFi Score, a comprehensive scoring system that assesses user behavior both off and on-chain to gauge user value. The system effectively filters out bots and malicious actors, enabling projects to reward quality users with access to airdrops, specialized campaigns and exclusive events.\nEstablishing new standards for Web3\nBuilding a streamlined social farming ecosystem has paid off for Cookie3 and Cookie DAO, as the COOKIE token airdrop campaign attracted over 100,000 participants in less than a week. \u201CThe COOKIE Airdrop conducted by Cookie DAO builds upon the learning and success of Portal coin\u2019s and Block Game\u2019s social farming campaigns,\u201D said Filip Wielanier, CEO and co-founder of Cookie3.\nHow AI and MarketingFi create a value cycle between users, projects and creators. Source: Cookie3\nHe added that the airdrop utilizes Cookie3 analytics and AI technology to create a viral marketing phenomenon. The main goal is to become the new airdrop and social farming standard. \u201CIt\u2019s not just about spreading awareness but cultivating a community where every interaction counts,\u201D Wielanier summarized.\nWeb3 enhances user engagement by leveraging blockchain\u2019s transparency and traceability, transforming how community interactions are valued. By utilizing AI to score both on- and off-chain actions, rewards are more effectively directed to genuinely engaged users. This shift emphasizes meaningful engagement over mere participation, promising a future where active, value-creating community members are prioritized in the digital landscape.\nPlease note that some functionalities of Cookie3 are still under development and not yet live.\nDisclaimer: The objective of this article is for informational purposes only.

These fees can vary significantly, making it important to monitor crypto transactions closely. A user can identify patterns and develop strategies to minimize costs by analyzing transaction history. Viewing transaction history can help with tracking and transaction analysis.\nA cryptocurrency holder can perform transaction tracking in various ways, such as utilizing the search function on a blockchain explorer. This article provides a step-by-step guide on checking crypto transaction logs and where to find the historical data, which is crucial for transaction analysis.\nWhere to check crypto transactions history\nUsers can employ several strategies for transaction viewing:\n1. Blockchain explorer\nBlockchain explorers are blockchain-specific, meaning they only work with the particular blockchain they\u2019re designed for. A blockchain explorer is a tool that reveals records on the crypto ledger.\nMost explorers are open to the public, enabling the viewing of all transactions initiated and completed on a blockchain network. Each entry contains transaction details, such as the amount, timestamp and the sender and receiver\u2019s address.\nBlockchain explorers have an intuitive user interface (UI), allowing users to search for all transactions, blocks, wallet addresses and digital asset history. It keeps track of all cryptocurrency records, enabling the confirmation of transaction status, block and wallet balance. A blockchain explorer can help diagnose a transaction or wallet balance issue.\nExamples of cryptocurrency explorers include:\nbtcscan.org\/ - Bitcoin\netherscan.io - Ethereum\nsolscan.io - Solana\nlive.blockcypher.com\/ltc\/ - Litecoin\nbithomp.com\/explorer - XRP\nA user can use the explorer to verify the transaction history details of a wallet by entering the wallet\u2019s address in the explorer\u2019s search bar. This method is also effective for a cold wallet, which is not connected to the internet, by first securely accessing the address of the cold wallet to search for its transaction history. Before using this functionality, taking appropriate security measures to protect your funds and private keys is crucial.\n2. Crypto wallet\nIf the searcher used a wallet to transfer tokens, they can use its cryptocurrency records to access the transaction history. A wallet records all the registered incoming and outgoing transactions in the history section of the wallet. Click any transaction to view its details.\n3. Third-party services\nSome third-party platforms can offer insights into transaction histories as they can provide a feed of all transactions. These platforms have a user-friendly interface that displays aggregated data from a blockchain.\nMost third-party platforms allow users to view transactions on desktops or smart devices. They allow users to filter transactions using parameters, such as the amount, date and transaction or token type, presenting the results in an easy-to-understand format.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nSimilarly, the cryptocurrency market has plenty of crypto wallet tracker tools that help track wallet transactions. By entering the search query, a user will gain access to transaction history, investment patterns and potentially some wallet-holder information (if the network allows for reduced anonymity).\n4. Downloading the entire blockchain\nExpert users can download the entire blockchain history by running a full node. This gives them offline access to local searches rather than relying on online resources.\nHowever, running a full archival node can be resource-intensive and requires significant storage space. For instance, it is not unusual for the node to require 340 gigabytes of space the first time a user runs it.\nHow to view crypto transaction history on a blockchain explorer\nUsers may follow these steps when using a blockchain explorer to view transaction history:\nStep 1: Go to the search field on the blockchain explorer.\nStep 2: Enter the details of the crypto transaction. The explorer allows users to search by different parameters like the sender\u2019s or receiver\u2019s address, transaction ID, transaction date or the block hash where the transaction data is stored.\nIf the results do not display after entering the search query, click \u201Csearch\u201D or the search button to start the search.\nStep 3: If the user enters the right transaction details on the search bar, they will receive a result or a list of the possible results that could match the transaction under search.\nTo find a particular transaction, enter the exact details of the transaction, such as the transaction hash or the exact amount sent.\nStep 4: Click on the desired transaction to enter the transaction page, which provides further details about the transaction. View or download\/export the transaction(s) for analysis, or copy a transaction ID and send it to anyone needing proof.\nHow to utilize a blockchain explorer to view wallet history\nInstead of logging into a wallet to view transaction history, a user can follow these steps to view the transaction history of a crypto wallet:\nStep 1: Go to the search bar of a blockchain explorer.\nStep 2: Enter the exact wallet address on the search bar. It\u2019s preferable to copy-paste the address from the wallet app to avoid errors. Click the \u201Csearch\u201D or search button.\nN\/B: Ensure the wallet under search is compatible with the blockchain explorer.\nStep 3: The search results will display the entire digital currency history and the assets present in the wallet. View the different categories, including analytics and public comments on the wallet.\nHow to use wallet activity to view transaction history\nThe multichain Exodus wallet is used for illustrative purposes to access wallet transaction history:\nStep 1: After logging into Exodus, click the wallet icon.\nStep 2: Locate and click the portfolio button. Users with multiple portfolios should click the corresponding portfolio for which they want to view the transaction history. Those with only one portfolio should skip to step 3.\nStep 3: Click the profile button at the bottom. Select the history button to view historical transactions.\nStep 4: To narrow the search, click the \u201CAll\u201D drop-down menu to filter the transactions using options like sent, received or exchanged transactions.\nStep 5: Click on a transaction to view its details.\nHow to use third-party services to view the transaction history\nThe Exodus platform will be used to illustrate the use of third-party services for accessing blockchain history:\nStep 1: Click\/tap the \u201CHistory\u201D icon on the Exodus desktop or mobile app. Users should click\/tap the portfolio they want to view. If users do not have multiple portfolios, they should skip to the next step.\nStep 2: Filter the results using the \u201CAll assets\u201D drop-down menu. The drop-down menu lets users filter results by sent, received and swapped categories. This assists in narrowing down the results, making it easier to locate particular transactions.\nStep 3: Click any individual transaction to scrutinize its details.\nViewing transaction histories by downloading a blockchain\nThe Bitcoin network will be used for illustrative purposes.\nStep 1: Start the initial block download (IBD) process, which involves downloading the entire blockchain and then verifying the blocks. Although the installation process provides a wallet, it only stores and records transactions after installation.\nStep 2: Open the Bitcoin blocks subdirectory to view transaction history. Note that it will show all Bitcoin transactions, not just the users\u2019.\nSince the transactions are indecipherable as they are .dat files, build or link a wallet interface\/a web front end that installs a blockchain explorer UI. The wallet or explorer will visually represent the data, making it easier to understand.\nStep 3: If the user installed the wallet or blockchain explorer interface, follow the steps provided in the wallet and explorer sections above to view transaction histories.\nHow to find lost crypto transactions\nFor an investor, tracking out misplaced or lost cryptocurrency transactions can be a tedious experience. The first thing to do is to review existing records in detail. This includes looking through a cryptocurrency wallet\u2019s transaction history, reviewing exchange statements to look for missing transactions, and looking through emails to find confirmations from exchanges or wallets.\nThe transaction can be tracked using a blockchain explorer for the relevant cryptocurrency if a fragment of the transaction hash or wallet address is known.

Lens Protocol is a decentralized social graph that allows creators to own their content as NFTs.\nIn addition to Lens, Phaver supports decentralized social graphs such as Farcaster, MocaID and CyberConnect. With all supporting social graphs, Phaver makes social connections more secure and permanent by improving user control and enabling interoperability.\nA seamless transition to Web3 social interaction\nCointelegraph Accelerator participant Phaver provides a simple introduction to its platform without requiring any crypto wallet for initial registration. Users can sign up using a traditional email or Web2 login, suitable for those new to Web3 technology. Once registered, users can create a Phaver profile without requiring any blockchain knowledge. For those with a Lens profile, Phaver allows easy integration during the registration process.\nIn the Phaver app, users have the flexibility to personalize their experience. Phaver users can subscribe to various interests or follow other participants. If no specific selection is made, the feed will default to showing the latest popular content so new users can discover exciting discussions and content.\nTo enhance users\u2019 personalized experience further, Phaver incorporates a unique reward system called Cred. Users can connect one or more wallets and start earning Creds and points based on their activity on the platform and the eligible NFTs they own. The score measures users\u2019 reputation within the platform, taking into account their contributions and interactions. Users with higher Cred scores have greater influence and trustworthiness within the community, which encourages positive engagement and discourages malicious behavior.\nCreating a Phaver profile requires no blockchain knowledge, making it accessible to all users. Source: Phaver\nBuilding on its innovative reward system, Phaver is also taking proactive steps to secure the platform against AI manipulations and the creation of fake content by introducing the Anima proof-of-personhood. The platform stores each user\u2019s unique privacy-safe facial print in the user\u2019s wallet. Participants can connect their wallets and complete a facial scan to claim a unique NFT, proving their uniqueness.\nPhaver also offers advanced features, such as purchasing points or participating in gamified social experiences for more meaningful engagement. These features reward the creator and allow the \u201Cstakeholder\u201D to earn rewards if the promoted posts become popular.\nKeeping users engaged\nSince its founding, Phaver has reached 300,000 unique app installs, 50,000 weekly active users and $150 million in connected NFT value on Phaver Cred. Behind this data lies user retention ability, a critical metric for any social platform. In South Korea, for example, users spend an average of six hours a week on Phaver, underscoring the app\u2019s ability to keep users engaged.\nPhaver has also formed partnerships that enhance its platform and expand its reach. Notable collaborations include Lotte Group\u2019s NFT arm in Korea and The Smurfs, both of which are exploring and expanding their Web3 footprint.\nPhaver is poised to solidify its position in the Web3 social media space through several strategic initiatives. The platform plans to improve multi-protocol integration by adding support for additional decentralized social graphs such as CyberConnect and Farcaster.\nPhaver is dedicated to creating an internet where users have ownership. Source: Phaver\nPhaver is also preparing to transform the onboarding process for new users with a Web2 background. By making points available for purchase as in-app purchases, Phaver aims to simplify entry into the Web3 space and make it as easy as downloading and interacting with a traditional app.\nMoreover, Phaver will continue to develop its proprietary trust score and expand it to cover a broader range of social metrics. At the same time, the platform is exploring the introduction of NFT-gated topics that will bring together select NFT holders for exclusive discussions and networking opportunities.\nPhaver envisions a future where users can freely engage in decentralized social networks without fear of encountering AI-generated content or bots. By implementing innovations such as the Anima proof-of-personhood platform and Cred scores, the platform aims to mitigate the risks posed by AI threats and foster a more authentic and trustworthy online experience.\nSupporting user-centered platforms that prioritize security, authenticity and community participation will contribute to the development of the crypto and Web3 ecosystem.

Call options give investors the right to buy a cryptocurrency at a specific price before a certain date. Put options, on the other hand, allow investors to sell a cryptocurrency at a particular price before the expiry date.\nInvestors often use the put\/call ratio as a metric to assess the general state of the market. If traders are purchasing more puts than calls, it is considered a bearish sign, and if they are purchasing more calls than puts, then the market sentiment is considered bullish.\nA put-to-call ratio below 0.7 is considered bullish, while a ratio of more than 1 is regarded as a bearish indicator.\nRelated: US lawmakers urge SEC to approve Bitcoin options trading\nOn May 3, a total of 23,367 Bitcoin contracts worth $1.39 billion are set to expire.

The maximum pain point refers to the price at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders.\nBitcoin options expiry.

From a product perspective, or feature perspective, we have more features on-chain than you could really replicate in a centralized exchange.\u201D\nDespite the greater diversity of applications on-chain, Warwick noted that crypto users were still utilizing centralized exchanges (CEXs) for crypto-related financial activity by a \u201Csignificant margin.\u201D\nHe explained that despite the flaws of CEXs being surfaced by events such as the collapse of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, crypto investors still didn\u2019t make the leap into DeFi and instead opted to move to competitor exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.\nKain Warwick speaking at Pragma Sydney\nFor Warwick, the barriers preventing users from onboarding into DeFi couldn\u2019t be traced back solely to products nor did it fall back to promises of increased safety. Instead, these onboarding issues were primarily rooted in issues with user experience.\nHe explained that Infinex would function as the \u201CUX layer,\u201D offering a more centralized exchange-like interface for users to engage with decentralized applications on a range of blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum and Solana.\n\u201CIt\u2019s a really hard thing to do well, but I think we are at least getting pretty close on the Infinex side.\u201D\nWarwick added that Infinex would utilize social passkeys to enable users to log in via Web2 applications \u2014 such as a Google account \u2014 and reduce the \u201Cfriction\u201D that typically accompanies a standard Web3 user experience.\n\u201CThe core component is you will have an account that you will own \u2014 it\u2019s self-custodial \u2014 but you will be able to effectively login to that account via Web2,\u201D Warwick said.\n\u201CThe starting point of [Infinex] you can have an account, and then you can deposit into that account to earn governance points,\u201D said Warwick. He added there would be a points-farming game that would run for the month following the launch.\nOn March 13, Infinex suffered a security breach, which saw Warwick quickly take over as head of the project\u2019s working group.\nSource: Infinex\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Warwick said the security vulnerability was \u201Cpart of the reason\u201D Infinex\u2019s launch \u2014 initially targeted for Q4 2023 \u2014 was delayed.\nThe security vulnerability was a social engineering attack that saw hackers gain access to a password vault, Warwick said. From there, they were then able to get into the protocol\u2019s DNS store and modify Infinex\u2019s DNS.\nRelated: Synthetix DEX launch to join efforts reducing the \u2018serious friction\u2019 in DeFi\n\u201CThere were no funds at risk because we weren\u2019t live \u2014 but just from learning a lesson sort of thing \u2014 even prior to being live, that just shouldn\u2019t be able to happen,\u201D he said.\n\u201CI came in and I brought a couple of other people in and we burned all of the systems to the ground and rebuilt everything from scratch. It\u2019s now one of the most secure environments I\u2019ve ever worked in.\u201D\nWarwick shared that the May 13 launch date is the proposed launch date that has been provided to Infinex\u2019s governing DAO \u2014 the Infinex Council \u2014 which still needs to vote on-chain to approve the launch.\nHe said he was confident the council would approve \u2014 but the decision starts and ends with the council.\nFollowing Infinex\u2019s launch, Warwick hopes to see it crack $50 million in total value locked and attract 10,000 genuine users within the first 30 days.\n\u201CWe have 200,000 people on the waitlist but a lot of those are sybils, airdrop farmers and bots.

Bitvavo will stake user assets across multiple proof-of-stake protocols, including Ethereum, Solana and Near.\nA statement from Bitvavo CEO and co-founder Mark Nuvelstijn highlighted the exchange\u2019s efforts to review and enhance its products and services. The company also confirmed that Figment is an expansion and diversification of its pool staking service providers, which include Coinbase, Copper and Kiln.\nNuvelstijn added that staking has become an integral part of the cryptocurrency industry and that the provision is an essential service for its customer base of more than 1.5 million users across the Benelux region.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nThe Bitvavo CEO said that working with Figment would allow the exchange to provide additional security and safety around staking and expand the offering:\n\u201CFigment is one of the staking infrastructure leaders in the market, and we continue to be impressed by their staking- and up-to-date market knowledge.\u201D\nFigment's head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Eva Lawrence, said the two teams have been working together for six months with the view of spearheading the exchange\u2019s staking services across Europe.\nThe partnership is set to provide access to staking rewards on Bitvavo on newly launched networks. Figment is also establishing dedicated validator nodes for Bitvavo to provide high-quality network performance and security.\nThe Dutch exchange has continued a steady approach to expanding its footprint into Europe.

FanSociety hopes to be the Web3 platform that makes this possible.","date":"2024-05-01","post_content":"Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, took the world by storm in 2019 \u2014 and then eroded to near rubble as the entire crypto market contracted and the industry fell into a nearly two-year-long bear market. An objective assessment of the NFT phenomena might conclude that the technology did deliver on a good deal of its promises, and instead of writing off the failed projects as scams, it might be more insightful to take a closer look at what features were needed to make projects successful. \nOn Episode 35 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Ray Salmond and Jonathan DeYoung spoke with Miles, a Web3 developer who is the creative mind behind FanSociety \u2014 a funding mechanism for musicians that borrows and blends ideas from traditional fan clubs of the 1950s with modern crowdfunding ideas and immutable storage on blockchain networks.\nTech should be adaptable and give users room to grow\nAny aspiring musician knows that securing funding for an album is difficult, and of course, once the album is out, locking in fans for life becomes the next hurdle. Miles explained that he envisions FanSociety being used as a tool for creators to connect with their audience, reward loyalty and grow in a way that is more organic than the typical NFT collections that currently exist.\nHe also explained that FanSociety has the dual purpose of allowing musicians to raise money from fans while also rewarding and retaining them by giving them digital artifacts as part of their expanding discography.\nAccording to Miles, a recurring issue with NFT collections is that projects often have fixed sizes and creators need to issue a new contract to \u201Cextend\u201D the collection:\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t make sense to have a limit, you know, and kind of just have one smart contract. And, like I said, it\u2019s like a boolean. You either have the token, you either have the NFT or you don\u2019t. And a lot of what was going on as well was very successful musicians were launching NFT projects, and it was kind of that same situation where, you know, they\u2019ve only got 10,000 NFTs available, and you either have one or you don\u2019t. And to me, that\u2019s very elitist and kind of antithetical to kind of the whole Web3 ethos, to me. And so I wanted to do something different.\u201D\nRelated: NFT utility continues to captivate fashion and luxury brands \u2014 NFT Paris\nFan engagement should also have value\nRevenue sharing is another issue FanSociety aims to tackle. Miles lamented that popular streaming platforms and record labels only give creators a sliver of the revenue generated by their music and that platforms tend to absorb the bulk of tips that creators receive from fans:\n\u201CYou look at Twitch, for example. You tip somebody, you give them money, you subscribe to them. First of all, the platform takes 50% rev[enue] split, which is atrocious to me. And we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to go up in the future, right? The content creators on there don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to go up to 60%, 70%, if they\u2019re going to throw more fees on top of that. So there\u2019s that kind of problem.\u201D\nFor artists who will use the platform to expand their catalog and engage with fans, Miles said the NFTs can be a more meaningful show of appreciation than \u201Ca sticker pack to put in their chat\u201D or something else that is kind of gimmicky and \u201Cnot very valuable.\u201D\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nMiles said:\n\u201CI\u2019d like to see more value being able to be given back to the supporters, and so that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to support. And it\u2019s up to the artist to decide what sorts of things, what sorts of ways they want to show their appreciation to people who support them.\u201D\nTo hear more from Mile\u2019s conversation with The Agenda \u2014 including his future plans for FanSociety \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The approval of spot ETFs in the United States is also ushering in a new era of crypto adoption and putting a new emphasis on real-world assets (RWA).\nRWA tokens, which are essentially tokens with real-world representatives, promise to bridge crypto and TradFi, improving the liquidity, accessibility and efficiency of tokenized assets. Moving trade to the internet is estimated to generate $280 billion of savings annually, and RWA tokenization offers a blockchain-based solution to achieve this goal.\nAsset passport for borderless trading\nMattereum is a London-based RWA initiative founded by Vinay Gupta, who was also the Ethereum launch coordinator in 2015. The project\u2019s system makes it possible to tokenize, fractionalize and trade real-world assets on-chain while providing a legal bond between the token and the asset in the real world.\nOperating as a legal hub for tokenized RWA developers, Mattereum\u2019s legal tech solution creates a formal legal connection between an on-chain token and the physical asset it represents. It does so by issuing a Mattereum Asset Passport, which connects the token to the physical asset so that the owner of the token can be shown to legally own the respective RWA. The Asset Passport also provides money-back warranties on the accuracy of the information about an RWA (such as its description, authenticity and condition) that a buyer uses when making purchasing decisions.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nMattereum\u2019s legal infrastructure is based on the United Kingdom\u2019s common law provisions for digital commerce. Owing to the 1958 New York Convention on arbitration, the provisions are enforceable in more than 170 countries, legitimizing and making Asset Passports available for use in all of them.\nBy carrying RWAs on-chain, Mattereum facilitates access to real-world assets, expanding and globalizing their market. The legal services provided by Mattereum eliminate national borders in RWA trading, aligning with blockchain\u2019s fundamental ethos, such as decentralization and borderlessness.\nMattereum concentrates on high-value assets like gold, real estate, and fine art, as well as assets that lag behind in digitalization compared to the likes of stocks and bonds. However, the solution is applicable to almost any asset class.\nMattereum offers full legal protection for RWA projects. Source: Mattereum\nThe platform presents users with options for both fractionalized and nonfungible tokenization. Users may opt to produce a complete digital twin by minting an ERC-721 token \u2014 the Ethereum standard for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) \u2014 or fractionalize the real-world asset by minting ERC-20 representatives.\nTokenizing gold and real estate\nFounded in 2017, Mattereum has been working to get smart contracts on blockchain as legally accepted contracts. The RWA project began offering services in 2021 by tokenizing Hollywood collectibles, such as props and merchandise from top-rated movies. It then moved onto gold and real estate.\nMattereum is now focusing on its token sale. Launched by Mattereum\u2019s German subsidiary Mattereum GmbH, the Mattereum Discount Token\u2019s (MATR) proceeds will be used to fund company expansion and development. The platform will also feature tokenized and fractionalized gold and real estate on-chain.\nCommenting on the gap Mattereum fills between blockchain and traditional assets, Vinay Gupta, the founder and CEO of Mattereum, said:\n\u201CMattereum is providing a key service for the new real-world asset ecosystem on the blockchain by providing the legal layer that connects tokens with assets so that their properties are confirmed by warranties and their ownership can be proved in court almost anywhere in the world. We are fully live and ready to provide these services today to other RWA companies in the space. This is vital for bringing world trade on-chain and has the potential to make Mattereum bigger than Visa.\u201D\nThe MATR token is available for purchase through Mattereum GmbH\u2019s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, Swarm. Buying MATR is subject to terms and conditions in eligible jurisdictions \u2014 in particular, residents of the United Kingdom and the United States are excluded from the public sale of MATR.\nCrypto\u2019s resurgence will undoubtedly bring a new focus on RWAs, and Mattereum offers a comprehensive perspective on tokenization that prioritizes legality and compliance.\nFind out more about Mattereum\n#Blockchain\n#Law\n#Gold\n#Technology\n#Assets\n#Real Estate\n#Tokens\n#NFT\n#Regulation\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.

I\u2019ve been there for over 20 years. This city\u2019s given me everything: my business, my purpose. My two children were born here. I plan to be buried in the city,\u201D said Rose. \u201CSo it\u2019s my way of giving back.\u201D\nRose, a fierce advocate for freedom of speech, conducts long-form interviews on his \u201CDigital Freedom Platform,\u201D drawing comparisons with major podcaster Joe Rogan.

Many of Rose\u2019s interview subjects hail from the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, informing his political outlook.\nRose told Cointelegraph that the current leadership of the United Kingdom isn\u2019t doing enough to promote the crypto industry.\n\u201CI really believe we could push London as a crypto-first city and bring in massive amounts of business and industry,\u201D said Rose. \u201CUnfortunately, we just don\u2019t have that right now, and the prime minister is paying crypto a bunch of lip service.\u201D\nIn 2022, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stated his intention to make the U.K. \u201Ca global hub for crypto asset technology,\u201D but in 2024, evidence of progress toward this goal remains scant.\nRose argues that Sunak is not the only one underperforming. The entrepreneur also believes the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) \u2014 which regulates cryptocurrency in the U.K. \u2014 is misfiring.\n\u201CThe FCA and the other organizations are literally pushing companies out, and that\u2019s a shame,\u201D said Rose.\nBlockchain use cases and London coin\nRose tells Cointelegraph that his association with Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency is longstanding.\nLondon Real regularly features high-profile names from the cryptocurrency world. The entrepreneur explains how he previously attracted big names to interview:\n\u201CI started featuring the top 100 people in crypto, and they said \u2018yes\u2019 because I had two million YouTube subscribers. That\u2019s probably the biggest channel they would ever be on,\u201D he said.\n\u201CI could have Michael Saylor, Raoul Pal, Yat Siu and most of the layer-1 founders \u2014 Justin Sun, Hedera Hashgraph, Avax \u2014 and they taught me about the blockchain.\u201D\n\u201CI had Max Keiser on my show in 2013 talking about Bitcoin. That\u2019s when I bought my first Bitcoin and went down the rabbit hole. I would later have Andreas Antonopoulos on my show in 2015, \u201817 and \u201819. Some people call him the Bitcoin Jesus,\u201D said Rose.\nRecent: DeFi bull market confounds expectations with RWAs and \u2018recursive airdrops\u2019\nRose is further pushing a policy agenda that is heavy on cryptocurrency and blockchain. One of his proposals to win over Londeners is the creation of a \u201CLondon coin.\u201D\nAccording to Rose, the token would put the equivalent of £100 into the hands of every London resident, sourcing liquidity from a tax on the traditional financial sector.\n\u201CWe want to inject it with 1 billion pounds of liquidity, with a one-off 1% tax from the banks, who make all of their money in the City of London and probably don\u2019t pay anything back,\u201D said Rose.\n\u201CThen, what we would do is put that in the wallets and hands of every man, woman and child and use them to stake that for additional yields, allowing them to pay for public transport and other services with that and that alone. If we can make that work over the next 12 months, it could literally be copied by so many other cities.\u201D\nRose added, \u201CI want something super functional that\u2019ll have DeFi practicalities in there as well. So that\u2019s the plan for the London coin.\u201D\nBlockchain for democracy\nFor Rose, blockchain goes beyond financial applications.

Rahman was excluded from standing that year.\nIn March 2022, Communities Minister Kemi Badenoch wrote to the Metropolitan Police and the Electoral Commission, expressing concerns that voting fraud could occur again. In May 2022, Rahman was reelected to Tower Hamlets.\nRose sees a similar problem across the Atlantic, pointing to an erosion in voter trust after the last United States presidential elections.\n\u201CAfter the 2020 elections, especially in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I heard a lot of people say there hasn\u2019t been a fair election in that city for 100 years,\u201D said Rose.\nIn an April 25 press release, Rose said blockchain \u201Ccan help the electorate see and interrogate voting, as well as securing the electoral process, providing a permanent, accessible and reliable record.\u201D\nRegarding London elections, Rose told Cointelegraph, \u201CI\u2019m not accusing anyone of election fraud, but I am saying that the job of London Elects is to make the British public confident that their vote matters.\u201D\nLondon Elects is the body responsible for the mayoral elections in London.\nBrian Rose is running for mayor of London. Source: Brian Rose\nRun-ins with Ofcom and YouTube\nRose, the host of the longstanding London Real podcast, is not without critics or controversy.\nIn fact, much of Rose\u2019s politics are intertwined with his podcast and the events surrounding its broadcast.\nIn 2020, during the U.K.\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown, Rose broadcast an episode of London Real featuring professional conspiracy theorist David Icke. Icke is best known for popularizing the theory that the U.K. royal family are shapeshifting lizards from outer space (or another dimension).\nFree speech advocate Rose told Cointelegraph, \u201CI don\u2019t agree with everything that my guests say by any means, but I believe they have the right to say it.\u201D\nIn 2020, Icke offered a number of conspiracies regarding COVID-19. On London Real, Icke blamed an electromagnetic \u201Csoup of radiation toxicity\u201D for compromising the immune systems of the elderly and said a cult was using the virus to create an \u201COrwellian global state\u201D enabled by artificial intelligence.\nThe U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom, received 48 complaints about the London Real broadcast.\n\u201CWe didn\u2019t incite violence. We didn\u2019t incite overthrows of governments. It was literally just two people talking. But I guess that was considered dangerous,\u201D Rose said.\nOn the podcast, Rose resisted or outright disagreed with Icke\u2019s theories.\n\u201CI do believe in the science, and I do believe in vaccines,\u201D he told Icke at the time.\nDespite this, Rose was censored, and the broadcast was removed from YouTube. Ofcom later ruled that the program \u201Chad the potential to cause significant harm to viewers in London during the Coronavirus crisis.\u201D\nDigital Freedom Platform\nThe censorship of his YouTube channel set Rose on a path to creating the \u201CDigital Freedom Platform,\u201D a website that hosts London Real broadcasts. He no longer uploads to YouTube, telling Cointelegraph that he was permanently deplatformed eight months ago.\nRose\u2019s followers crowdfunded the Digital Freedom Platform to the tune of $1 million. During the raise, Rose stated that $200,000 would be earmarked for the application of blockchain technology.\nCointelegraph asked Rose how that blockchain integration was progressing.\n\u201CThe problem is that putting video on the blockchain is still not doable,\u201D Rose explained. \u201CThere are a couple of companies in Dubai right now that I\u2019m talking to, but right now, from a bandwidth perspective, it\u2019s just nearly impossible.\u201D\nHe added, \u201CI would love to do it because we continue to be censored.\u201D\nIn an interview with PoliticsJoe in April 2021, Rose gave another reason for not implementing blockchain into the Digital Freedom Platform. He said he\u2019d \u201Calready spent the money\u201D on other aspects of the platform, including livestreams.\nRecent: US stablecoin bill to \u2018cement\u2019 dollar dominance, fight sanction evasion\nWhen Cointelegraph spoke with Rose, the broadcaster was in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, promoting his documentary film We Will Not Be Silenced. The documentary centers on the censorship of London Real in 2020 and stars David Icke, with whom Rose has fostered an ever-closer working relationship in recent years.\nAt the premiere, Rose said, \u201CBefore I was an advocate for free speech, but now I\u2019m a fanatic [...] they chose the wrong white boy to f*ck with.\u201D\nRose tells Cointelegraph he plans to spend the final few days of the campaign back in London, aiming to secure every last vote he can. Should the entrepreneur capture five percent of the vote or more, it would strengthen the case for Rose to be included in future televised mayoral debates \u2014 if he decided to stand again.\nLondon goes to the polls on May 2.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Markets Outlook newsletter\nGet critical insights to spot investment opportunities, mitigate risks, and refine your trading strategies.

This complexity limited the internet\u2019s reach to tech experts with advanced technical knowledge.\nHowever, the release of Windows 95 revolutionized the landscape by introducing a user-friendly graphical user interface integrated with an internet browser. This significant shift enabled individuals without technical backgrounds to perform complex operations with simple clicks and drags.\nAs a result, the number of internet users surged dramatically from 14% of American adults in 1995 to 46% in five years. Today, the Web3 ecosystem is at a similar turning point, grappling with its own complexities that hinder wider user adoption.\nFrom Windows to intent-centric infrastructure\ndappOS, an intent execution network, aims to be the Windows 95 of Web3. With a recent $15.3 million Series A funding round led by Polychain, valuing the project at $300 million, dappOS aims to provide developers with the infrastructure to integrate intent-centric functionality, thus simplifying the blockchain user experience to a level akin to using an application as intuitive as TikTok.

On the other side, developers can leverage these services to fulfill user intents based on current network conditions and available service providers. Democratizing access to blockchain capabilities, dappOS\u2019 structure optimizes the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of operations.\nOne of the standout innovations of dappOS is its Optimistic Minimum Staking mechanism. The system allows tasks to be executed immediately, with verification following completion.\nIf a task fails, the network reaches a consensus on penalizing the responsible service provider to ensure successful task completion or appropriate compensation for the users. This arrangement benefits service providers by requiring only a minimal stake, slightly above the total value of potential uncompleted tasks, and benefits users through enhanced efficiency and reduced costs.\nFurther strengthening the user-centric approach, dappOS has introduced several intent-centric frameworks, like the Unified Account and Intent Assets.\ndappOS\u2019s intent-centric frameworks empower DApps with intent-centric functionality. Source: dappOS\nThe Unified Account seamlessly integrates across various blockchain networks, reminiscent of centralized exchange experiences, where users can effortlessly manage and use their assets without delving into technical complexities.\nIntent Assets, such as the intentUSD, function similarly to stablecoins but with added flexibility and automatic yield generation, addressing the common issues associated with liquidity and stability in the Web3 space. This innovative approach allows stablecoins to automatically transition between different forms in different scenarios. For example, intentUSD can function as Tether\nUSDT\n$1.00\nwhen USDT is required and can transform into USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\nfor USDC transactions.\nSimplifying DApp interactions for mainstream adoption\nMoreover, dappOS significantly refines the DApp interaction process by enabling real-time operations that can be completed with a single signature, eliminating the need for multiple intermediate steps typically associated with blockchain transactions. The improvement simplifies user interactions and meets blockchain technology\u2019s stringent security and decentralization standards.\nThe implications of dappOS\u2019 developments are profound, mirroring the transformative impact of Windows 95. Just as Windows 95 catalyzed the mass adoption of the internet, dappOS aims to do the same for Web3, potentially ushering in a new era of exponential growth and innovation in the blockchain space.\nAs more developers and users engage with the platform, dappOS is poised to become a central hub in the Web3 ecosystem, akin to how Windows 95 became a foundational technology of the internet age. Through its innovative design and strategic implementations, dappOS is simplifying the blockchain experience and setting the stage for a broader, more inclusive Web3 future.\nLearn more about dappOS\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Funding\n#Technology\n#Adoption\n#Windows\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

It allows one party to prove that another party is being truthful without revealing any concealed information. \nZK allows public blockchains to validate the existence of hidden data. With this, crypto users can confirm the legitimacy of information without disclosing its content.\nWhile the technology is still in its early beginnings, some believe it will have a similar impact as ChatGPT and gain similar waves of interest when it gets broader implementation.\nChatGPT moment for ZK\nIn a Cointelegraph interview at Token2049 in Dubai, Telos Foundation executive director John Lilic said there is no way to ignore ZK, as it is fundamental. Lilic described the technology as the \u201Cend game.\u201D\nLilic believes that people won\u2019t pay much attention to ZK soon because they find the concept hard to grasp. However, the executive is confident that there will come a time when ZK systems will garner the same level of attention as ChatGPT did when it was initially introduced. Lilic said:\n\u201CNobody\u2019s going to care so much. And then, suddenly, everything all at once will come onto the networks that have the best ZK systems. You see how fast the ChatGPT thing came. Suddenly, it was everywhere. That\u2019s how I think it\u2019s going to go with ZK.\u201D\nOn April 19, Telos Foundation partnered with Ponos Technology to develop a layer-2 network, leveraging Telos\u2019 SNARKtor, a decentralized recursive proof aggregator. According to Lilic, the move was part of their efforts to become a \u201Cnetwork of networks.\u201D\nStill in its early stages\nWhile ZK systems have a lot to be excited about when it comes to the future, the ChatGPT moment for these technologies might not happen in the near future.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nRichard Meissner, the co-founder of Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), which utilizes ZK systems for cross-chain ownership proofs, said that ZK tech is still in its \u201Cearly stages of development.\u201D\nThe executive said that more optimization is still needed to encourage adoption. Meissner explained:\n\u201CThere has been interest in the tech and in the last couple of months, it was possible to see prototypes for all kinds of use cases based on ZK-proofs. For example, cross-chain ownership proofs for smart accounts.\u201D\nMeanwhile, Terence Kwok, the founder of Humanity Protocol, which uses ZK systems within its ecosystem, described ZK\u2019s current state as \u201Cpromising and evolving.\u201D Kwok expressed optimism toward ZK\u2019s role in shaping a more secure, private and decentralized environments.\nKwok added that there are ongoing research and development efforts that aim to address ZK\u2019s limitations and expand its applicability.\n\u201CWith innovations on the horizon, such as improved scalability and usability, ZK technology holds immense potential for further adoption across diverse domains,\u201D Kwok added.\nWhy people should care about ZK\nMeissner pointed out that blockchains are transparent by principle. However, the executive also noted that publicly visible transactions may not be appropriate for all use cases.\nHe said that any interaction between two parties that may not fully trust each other might require ZK technology to \u201Cverify certain credentials without revealing sensitive details to enable trustless transactions.\u201D\nRelated: Ernst & Young taps ZK-proofs on Ethereum to automate contracts\nMeanwhile, Lilic gave examples of why people should care about ZK technology. The executive said the basic idea is \u201Cproving that you know something without disclosing what it is.\u201D\nLilic said that a potential use case for this technology lies in car rentals using a blockchain system with crypto payments integrated. The ZK director said that if people wanted to rent a car, a blockchain system might not be optimal if it would show a person\u2019s identity documents to others.\n\u201CYou\u2019re not going to use a blockchain system to rent that car if it means your license and your identity documents are on-chain forever for everyone to see. Okay? It\u2019s just not worth it.\u201D\nHowever, Lilic said that with ZK, people can simply go into the car rental shop and generate proof on their device that they have a valid license and meet the requirements for people who can drive a car.\n\u201CAnd instead of giving them your license, you simply share proof that you have a license. And it\u2019s valid. And these attributes are valid,\u201D Lilic added.\nWeb3 scalability relies on ZK\nApart from these, Kwok recognized that ZK technology is crucial for Web3 as the industry continues to empower individuals with control over their personal information. Kwok said:\n\u201CIn a time where data breaches and privacy violations are all too common, ZK technology serves as a shield, allowing individuals to assert their identity and authenticate transactions without exposing sensitive details.\u201D\nKwok believes that users should try to understand the concept behind ZK as it will allow them to make more informed decisions about the Web3 applications they use and share their data with.\nMagazine: 68% of Runes are in the red \u2014 Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.

This is not only happening on permissioned, centralized networks but also on decentralized protocols like XRPL, Stellar and Ethereum.\nInfanger said that advanced conversations with various financial institutions are ongoing, and they are exploring tokenization projects to issue assets on the XRP Ledger.

What they don\u2019t agree on is how. This is the \u201Cmodular\u201D versus \u201Cmonolithic\u201D discussion unfolding across the industry, and it\u2019s one of the most interesting \u2014 and sometimes contentious \u2014 debates.\nModular scaling calls for moving small-value transactions to a tiered system of layer-2s and even layer-3s that eventually settle to a base chain. This approach, which has been embraced by the Ethereum (ETH) community, has a major drawback: it leads to network fragmentation and an inferior user experience.\nMonolithic scaling \u2014 best exemplified by Solana (SOL) \u2014 calls for keeping all transactions on the same chain and optimizing the network with hardware, software, and consensus upgrades to give it greater throughput. The primary benefit of this approach is a better user experience. The main downside is that it can\u2019t possibly work, not without sacrificing the very features that make a blockchain appealing in the first place: decentralization and resilience.\nRelated: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halving\nProponents of the monolithic approach often misunderstand the fundamental service that a permissionless chain offers. It\u2019s not transaction processing \u2014 that\u2019s what centralized networks do. Decentralized networks provide a scarce asset called secure blockspace. Think of it as fuel, but for a decentralized economy. Like all scarce assets, secure blockspace has a limited supply. But demand fluctuates, so the ultimate arbiter of who gets to use it is price.\nThere\u2019s an old joke in commodities that \u201Cthe best cure for high oil prices is high oil prices.\u201D Higher prices can potentially lead to higher supply in the long run \u2014 although there isn\u2019t always more product to pull out of the ground. More importantly, higher prices are guaranteed to reduce demand now. They force everyone to use the commodity more efficiently and price out smaller users altogether.\nSolana's network crashed most recently in February. Source: X\nThat might seem unfair, but the goal is efficiency, not fairness. The alternative is for a third party like the government to either ration fuel or subsidize it. Neither works as intended. Rationing leads to long lines, subsidies lead to waste. Think: kids going on a joyride vs a factory that can\u2019t operate.\nWelcome to the current state of Solana. The monolithic chain experienced spiking demand during the memecoin mania in recent months, leading to high transaction failure rates. Users adopted by trying to submit their transactions over and over, exacerbating the problem. Solana doesn\u2019t have a network mempool, but it now has a de facto queue.\nUsers have been getting upset about Solana's outages for years. Source: X\nThis is what you\u2019d expect to happen if secure blockspace is priced too cheaply.\nModular chains provide different tiers of secure block space for different users \u2014 $20 to transact on ETH but only 2 cents to use Arbitrum. But Solana wants to give a $1 trade as much security as a $1 million transfer \u2014 even though the $1 trade, like the kids going on a joyride, doesn\u2019t need it.\nRelated: Bitcoin's halving won't see a 600% return this year \u2014 so adjust your strategy\nTo be fair, one of the upgrades Solana developers are working on are better fee markets that are more responsive to demand. But if these upgrades work then smaller traders will simply be priced out in peak times. Unlike a modular chain, they won\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\nThe other solution developers are working on are ways of scaling the network with upgraded software and faster hardware. What they don\u2019t realize is that doing so will just invite more small value transfers \u2014 there is no limit to demand if you price a scarce good cheap enough. Back when the Soviet Union used to subsidize bread, people would feed it to their animals.\nMeanwhile, the core network infrastructure becomes more centralized and less stable. A chain that is optimized to run at peak performance at all times is more likely to go down, as Solana has periodically.\nThe intentions of the monolithic approach to scaling may be commendable, but the outcomes aren\u2019t \u2014 not if we value decentralization and resilience.\nOmid Malekan is an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and the author of Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets, and Platforms.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Blockchain rollups provide quicker processing by acting as a self-checkout lane. To reduce network congestion, they group transactions and manage them off the main blockchain. This reduces the cost per transaction and expedites the process. \nFinally, for security purposes, a single transaction summary \u2014 which resembles a receipt for each self-checkout customer \u2014 is sent back to the main blockchain. This allows for faster and less expensive side transactions while maintaining the security of the main system. Rollups accomplish this in a variety of ways, but their main goal is to simplify blockchain transactions without sacrificing security.\nTypes of blockchain rollups\nZK-rollups and optimistic rollups are the two primary types of rollups. Both kinds of rollups ease mainnet congestion, resulting in speedier and less expensive transactions. \nZero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups)\nZK-rollups condense transaction data into a succinct proof using zero-knowledge proofs, which is subsequently sent to the main chain. ZK-rollups accomplish this by lowering the quantity of data that must be processed on-chain while preserving transaction security. \nZero-knowledge proofs ensure privacy by enabling validators to confirm the accuracy of the transactions without requiring access to the transaction details.\nOptimistic rollups\nAs implied by the name, optimistic rollups operate under the premise that all transactions are legitimate unless demonstrated to be otherwise.\nOptimistic rollups only submit the result to the main chain after processing transactions off-chain. The primary chain employs a fraud-proof technique to confirm the legitimacy of the transactions. The transactions are approved if there is no evidence of fraud, but if fraud is detected, the fraudulent transactions are rolled back. \nHow do blockchain rollups work?\nBefore uploading several transactions to the main blockchain, blockchain rollups process and bundle them off-chain. Here\u2019s a step-by-step process of how blockchain rollups work:\nOff-chain processing\nFirstly, a rollup smart contract processes transactions off-chain. This enables faster and more efficient transaction processing than dealing directly with the main blockchain.\nTransaction bundling\nThe rollup smart contract groups several transactions into a single batch. This bundling procedure reduces the amount of data that needs to be uploaded to the main blockchain.\nValidation and compression (for ZK-rollups)\nZero-knowledge proofs are used in ZK-rollups to condense transaction data into a brief proof. After being created off-chain, this proof is added to the primary blockchain.\nSubmission to the main blockchain\nThe rollup smart contract uploads the transaction batch or the compressed proof to the main blockchain after the transactions have been processed and bundled.\nVerification and settlement\nThe batch or proof that has been uploaded gets validated on the main blockchain. A fraud-proof technique is used to verify the legitimacy of transactions for optimistic rollups. The transactions are finalized on the main blockchain if no fraud is found.\nApplications of rollups\nRollups can help improve the scalability of blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), gaming and virtual worlds and supply chain businesses.\nAmong the important applications of rollups are:\nScalability solutions\nRollups process and bundle several transactions off-chain before submitting them to the main blockchain, which greatly increases the scalability of blockchain networks. This lowers transaction fees and congestion by enabling a larger transaction throughput.\nDecentralized finance\nIn the DeFi space, where large transaction volumes can cause congestion and expensive gas costs, rollups are very helpful. DeFi applications may be made much more scalable and user-friendly by using rollups, which makes transactions faster and more economical.\nNonfungible tokens\nNFT platforms can benefit from rollups by minting and processing NFTs off-chain before submitting them to the main blockchain. This lowers the time and expense involved in generating and trading NFTs.\nGaming and virtual worlds\nRollups facilitate faster and more effective in-game transactions, asset transfers and decentralized governance, all of which can enhance the scalability of blockchain-based virtual worlds and gaming.\nSupply chain management\nRollups enhance security, efficiency and transparency in the supply chain by tracking and validating transactions.\nRollups, in general, provide a flexible scaling option that can help a variety of blockchain applications by allowing them to manage increased transaction volumes without compromising the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain network.\nBenefits of blockchain rollups\nBlockchain networks can benefit from rollups in multiple ways, including scalability, low transaction fees, faster transaction processing, enhanced privacy and user experience.\nRollups greatly increase scalability by processing and grouping several transactions off-chain before sending them to the main blockchain. This allows blockchain networks to manage a higher volume of transactions.\nMoreover, rollups lessen congestion on the main blockchain, which lowers transaction fees. This increases user accessibility and affordability for blockchain transactions. By shifting a large portion of the computation off-chain, rollups allow for speedier transaction processing. This leads to enhanced user experience and faster confirmation times.\nZero-knowledge proofs are used by some rollup solutions, such ZK-rollups, to ensure transaction privacy. This preserves the security and integrity of the blockchain network while helping to protect user data and transaction details.\nFurthermore, by resolving the scalability issues that blockchain networks encounter, rollups provide an effective and intuitive user experience. This makes them appropriate for a variety of applications, including supply chain management, gaming, and DeFi and NFTs.\nFuture of blockchain rollups\nBlockchain rollups appear to have a bright future, as these scaling solutions are expected to have a major impact on advancing blockchain technology. \nRollups present a practical way to increase network capacity, lower transaction costs and improve user experience as blockchain networks expand and encounter scalability issues. Furthermore, rollups are expected to play a bigger role in the DeFi space, where gas fees and large transaction volumes have proven to be major obstacles.\nRollups\u2019 connectivity with Ethereum and other major blockchain platforms is a crucial component of their future. Rollups are likely to be essential in improving the network\u2019s scalability as Ethereum incorporates danksharding. \nThere will likely be more innovation in this field, such as advancements in security, privacy and interoperability as rollup technology matures. Though rollup systems like ZK-rollups and optimistic rollups are already becoming popular, new advancements could result in rollup solutions that are even more effective and scalable.

Staking refers to the process of locking up a cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to sustain it, and it enables the stakers to earn a profit. However, staked assets typically become illiquid during the staking period, as they can\u2019t be exchanged or transferred.\nLiquid staking enables cryptocurrency holders to take part in staking without giving up control over their holdings. This has transformed the way users approach staking. Projects such as Lido introduced liquid staking, offering a tokenized representation of staked assets in the form of tokens and derivatives. \nIt allows users to reap the advantages of staking while also retaining the flexibility to trade, trading these tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or transferring them to other users.\nIs there a difference between delegated staking and liquid staking?\nNetwork users in delegated proof-of-take (DPoS) cast votes to select the delegate of their preference. The purpose of liquid staking, however, is to let stakers circumvent the mechanism of minimum staking threshold and locked tokens.\nThough DPoS borrows its basic concepts from proof-of-stake, its execution is different. In DPoS, network users are empowered to elect delegates, called \u201Cwitnesses\u201D or \u201Cblock producers\u201D for block validation. The number of delegates participating in the consensus process is limited and can be adjusted through voting. Network users in DPoS can pool their tokens into a staking pool and use their combined voting power to vote for the preferred delegate.\nLiquid staking, on the other hand, is designed to bring down the threshold for investing and provide a way for stakers to circumvent the mechanism of locked tokens. Blockchains often have minimum requirements for staking. Ethereum, for instance, requires anyone who wants to set up a validator node to stake 32 Ether (ETH) minimum. It also requires specific computer hardware, software, time and expertise, which again requires plenty of investment.\nWhat is staking-as-a-service?\nStaking-as-a-service is a platform that serves as a mediator, connecting a blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism with cryptocurrency holders who want to contribute to the functioning of the network. \nStaking-as-a-service is a platform or service that enables users to delegate their crypto assets to a third party, who then participates in staking on the users\u2019 behalf, usually in exchange for a fee or a share of the rewards. JP Morgan notes that by 2025, the staking services sector will expand to a whopping $40 billion. Crypto staking services will play a large role in this emerging economy, and liquid staking will be an integral part of it.\nStaking-as-a-service platforms can be categorized as custodial and noncustodial based on their level of decentralization, which plays a major role in safeguarding stakeholders\u2019 best interests and maintaining transparency. To facilitate decentralized governance, key decisions are made by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). \nCustodial staking-as-a-service involves extensive management of the staking process. Staking services offered by crypto exchanges are custodial. Rewards first go to the staking provider before being distributed among stakers.\nIn the noncustodial staking-as-a-service model, a validator charges a commission to anyone who wants to participate in staking. In PoS networks that support native delegation, the staker\u2019s share of rewards is directly sent to them, with no involvement from the validator. \nHow liquid staking functions\nLiquid staking is designed to eliminate the threshold of staking and enable holders to make profits with liquid tokens.\nStaking pools allow users to consolidate several small stakes into a large one using a smart contract, which gives corresponding liquid tokens (representing their share of the pool) to each staker.\nThe mechanism eliminates the threshold of becoming a staker. Liquid staking takes it a step further and enables stakers to make double earnings. On the one hand, they earn from the staked tokens, and on the other hand, they make profits with liquid tokens by carrying out financial activities such as trading, lending or any other activity without impacting their original staked position.\nUsing Lido as a case study will help us understand better how liquid staking functions. Lido is a liquid staking solution for PoS currencies, which supports several PoS blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Kusama, Polkadot and Polygon. Lido provides an innovative solution to the hurdles presented by traditional PoS staking by effectively lowering barriers to entry and the costs associated with locking up one\u2019s assets in a single protocol.\nLido is a smart contract-based staking pool. Users who deposit their assets with the platform are staked on the Lido blockchain via the protocol. Lido allows ETH holders to stake fractions of the minimum threshold (32 ETH) to earn block rewards. Upon depositing funds into Lido\u2019s staking pool smart contract, users receive Lido Staked ETH (stETH), an ERC-20 compatible token, which is minted upon deposit and burned upon withdrawal.\nThe protocol distributes the staked ETH to validators (node operators) within the Lido network, and subsequently, it is deposited to the Ethereum Beacon Chain for validation. These funds are then safeguarded in a smart contract, which is inaccessible to validators. The ETH deposited via the Lido staking protocol is segregated into sets of 32 ETH among active node operators on the network.\nThese operators utilize a public validation key to validate transactions involving users\u2019 staked assets. This mechanism allows users\u2019 staked assets to be distributed across multiple validators, mitigating risks linked to single points of failure and single validator staking. \nStakers who deposit Solana\u2019s (SOL) token, Polygon (MATIC), Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama KSM with a set of smart contracts in Lido receive stSOL, stMATIC, stDOT and stKSM, respectively. The stTokens can be used for DeFi yield earning, providing liquidity, trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and many other use cases.\nAre there any risks associated with liquid staking platforms?\nLike any product or service in the crypto space, technical threats and market volatility need to be taken into account when dealing with liquid staking.\nTechnical threats\nPoS blockchains are still relatively new, and there is always the possibility of protocol bugs or vulnerabilities leading to asset loss or exploitation. Reliance on validators for staking also introduces counterparty risks.\nMarket risks\nLiquid staking unlocks the staked assets, enabling stakers to earn rewards from DeFi applications. However, this also opens up the risk of losing on two fronts in a market downturn.\nKeeping a liquid staking platform open-sourced and regularly audited helps protect against threats to an extent. Having a bounty program for the platform also helps minimize bugs. \nConducting comprehensive due diligence is crucial to combat the risks associated with market volatility. This involves researching historical market data, evaluating the financial health of potential investments, understanding the regulatory landscape and developing a diversified investment strategy.","post_cover":null,"author":"by Dilip Kumar Patairya","title":"What is liquid staking, and how does it work?","url":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/explained\/what-is-liquid-staking-and-how-does-it-work","tags":[]},{"summary":"Arkham Research notified DeFi wallet owners to look at the addresses and try to retrieve their funds, which have been stuck for months in bridge contracts.","date":"2024-04-27","post_content":"Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights \u2014 a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week.\nThe past week in DeFi saw BNB Chain announce native liquid staking on its BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

While the concept of experiencing the same connected virtual world predates the Web3 era, the blockchain made it possible for the participants to become governors and stakeholders of the same virtual universe they live in.\nFueled by mainstream tech giants\u2019 attempts to make metaverse popular in a Web2 fashion and technological advancements\u2014such as high-speed internet and smartphones becoming tiny supercomputers\u2014metaverse is expected to become a $5 trillion business by 2030.\nThe consumer and enterprise use cases for the metaverse. Source: McKinsey & Company\nDespite its massive potential, metaverse lacks a unified landscape to offer users a friendly experience. Over 160 companies are building their own metaverses across different blockchains and layers, and the lack of interoperability between networks creates a highly fragmented landscape for the metaverse.\nCreators and developers are shackled by fragmentation\nAs it stands, the metaverse is divided into myriad separate, incompatible worlds \u2014 each functioning as its own closed ecosystem. This segmentation stifles the flow of innovation from the developers\u2019 side while confining users and creators within the boundaries of individual platforms. Key assets like nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 game elements are locked within these siloed environments.\nThe consequences of this fragmentation extend beyond creative limitations, imposing substantial financial burdens on those who wish to build and offer experiences within the metaverse. Developing these digital landscapes and interactions requires a hefty investment, yet the primary financial benefits disproportionately favor platform holders rather than creators.\nAs the metaverse continues to evolve, the necessity for a framework that supports seamless interconnectivity and empowers creators becomes increasingly evident, suggesting a pivotal area for innovation and collaboration in the digital frontier.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

By unifying the fragmented metaverse, NFT and gaming landscape, Somnia seeks to give value and creative control back to the users and creators.\nUnlike decentralized finance-focused blockchains, which are slow and expensive, Somnia is built from scratch to provide a unified metaverse experience. This results in an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible L1 network that supports hundreds of thousands of transactions per second at minimal costs.\nDeveloped by the Virtual Society Foundation (VSF), a nonprofit organization initiated by Improbable and received initial funding from MSquared to operate as the \u201Cmetaverse computer,\u201D Somnia utilizes Improbable and Msquared\u2019s experience to host the next wave of users in the metaverse.\nA full breakdown of the Somnia ecosystem. Source: Somnia\nCreators can utilize Somnia\u2019s toolkit to move assets, commerce and avatars across different experiences. The omnichain protocol enables creators to participate in a decentralized economic structure where accrued value benefits the actual innovators, incentivizing the development of new use cases while opening the door for community-driven governance.\nSomnia helps users recompose or remix content and build on previous creations to make metaverse accessible to a broader audience. The project\u2019s approach makes hefty projects like organizing a new metaverse event more affordable by enabling the reuse of components from previous events, such as stages, light shows or firework displays. The original creators of the used components can earn royalties through microtransactions, rewarding all stakeholders in true Web3 fashion.\nUpgrading NFTs for metaverse\nSince NFTs were born in a two-dimensional environment, many ultra-popular collections were not in the metaverse conversation besides standing as static profile pictures. Somnia addresses this by \u201Cupgrading\u201D 2D NFTs to metaverse-friendly 3D objects. It allows NFT collectors to explore the metaverse as their favorite NFT character, potentially opening up the way for Pudgy Penguins and Cool Cats running around in a unified virtual space. Developers can also design metaverse themes based on ultra-popular NFT collections.\nSomnia hosts a metaverse browser to offer an interconnected experience for users.\nSomnia launched its betanet on Ethereum\u2019s Sepolia testnet while developing an EVM L1 for millions of users. During the betanet phase, users can bring their digital identities into the Somnia Protocol by creating personalized avatars through a collaboration with Avaturn. These avatars will be compatible with worlds or experiences built on Somnia, empowering users to attend massive MSquared events like the Twice listening party and MLB Virtual Ballpark.\nVirtual worlds, real economy\nSomnia envisions the metaverse as a sprawling, borderless virtual society where opportunities for creators are limitless, and collaboration is no harder than having a conversation. According to the Somnia team, metaverses should be compatible and interoperable for better collaboration and a user-friendly experience without losing individual platforms\u2019 independence.\nSource: Twitter\nSomnia aims to set the groundwork for more democratic, open and interconnected virtual worlds where users and creators have an influence on governance and future development. The main goal is to empower the creator economy by building a virtual society where creators can thrive by fostering trade, commerce and innovation.\nLearn more about Somnia\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Metaverse\n#Web3\n#NFT\nDisclaimer.

Established in 2019, Phemex distinguishes itself in the crowded market of crypto exchanges by addressing the specific needs of traders with a daily trading volume of approximately $2 billion across more than 300 trading pairs.\nPhemex has been making a splash in the crypto world with its pledge to become a hybrid exchange, embracing decentralization in its core processes. Just earlier this year, the dynamic exchange rolled out Pulse, its SocialFi platform, creating a one-stop hub where traders can seamlessly merge their social interactions and trading activities, all while earning rewards for their engagement.\nIn this interview, Phemex chief operating officer and co-founder of Pulse Stella Chan discusses the exchange\u2019s recent initiatives, including their presence at the Token 2049 event in Dubai, its newly launched lending protocol, Pulse season 3 and the new avenues they are exploring to enrich their user engagement and platform capabilities.\nCointelegraph: Phemex recently attended the Token 2049 event in Dubai. Could you give us a recap of the event and the atmosphere?\nStella Chan: Token 2049 was an outstanding success, and I\u2019m thrilled to report that our Phemex events truly made a splash, drawing attention from attendees worldwide. I am glad that the Cointelegraph team joined us and shared in the excitement as well. Our lineup of activities was in full force, featuring an exclusive night that united the crypto community, a compelling keynote delivered by the Phemex CEO and our interactive booth where participants engaged directly with the Phemex team.\nA standout moment was the reveal of our Phemex Lending Protocol, which allows users to borrow crypto at rock bottom rates without incurring extra fees and offers them the chance to also earn interest by supplying their assets. Lending allows traders to amplify their capital in the crypto space, enabling them to maximize opportunities in the current market cycle. We\u2019ve developed a comprehensive solution for borrowing and lending. As the response at Token 2049 confirmed, it perfectly aligns with traders\u2019 needs and is anchored by an exchange they trust and prefer for their trading activities.\nCT: As a cryptocurrency exchange, how does Phemex stay up-to-date with Web3 innovation and user demand?\nSC: The cryptocurrency domain is racing forward at a pace never seen before, going well beyond its initial conception as a mere digital substitute for physical currencies. This digital ecosystem is not limited to financial transactions; it includes a broad array of applications and services, from entertainment and social interaction to the comprehensive realm of decentralized finance (DeFi).\nPhemex has embraced this age of increased connectivity and user agency by adopting a hybrid model, blending the best of central exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into our operations. The rollout of our Web3 ecosystem Phemexia last year stands as a landmark move in this evolution.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThis tactical transformation is geared toward granting users more control over their financial engagements and social interactions, which are increasingly intertwined, all while upholding the security and reliability synonymous with Phemex.\nWe are now introducing our hybrid stack within this ecosystem, fusing the autonomy of an on-chain experience with the trusted performance of centralized execution, beginning with the launch of the Phemex Lending Protocol.\nCT: What are the specific benefits that users will enjoy from Phemex Lending Protocol?\nSC: The Phemex Lending Protocol offers the lowest borrowing rates in the market and is free of any extra fees or additional charges. It also features a competitive and transparent loan-to-value ratio. To kick-start this protocol, we\u2019re allocating $22 million in liquidity for our users\u2019 benefit.\nSource: Phemex\nThey can leverage their holdings to secure loans without selling their assets, taking advantage of some of the market\u2019s most favorable borrowing conditions with annual percentage yields (APYs) for borrowing as low as 3.57% currently, a stark contrast to the double-digit rates found on other platforms. We also ensure that users maintain full control over their funds, with the flexibility to withdraw and reallocate as they see fit.\nFurthermore, users have the option to contribute to our lending pools in return for an attractive APY that serves as a reliable source of passive income. This end-to-end solution allows users to benefit from excellent borrowing rates while simultaneously earning real-time annual percentage rate (APR) by providing liquidity with their assets.\nCT: How does the Phemex Lending Protocol integrate into the broader Phemexia Web3 ecosystem?\nSC: Phemex Lending Protocol is a cornerstone of the hybrid stack within our evolving Web3 ecosystem, marking the debut of our comprehensive suite of services. Our offerings are interconnected, creating a seamless end-to-end ecosystem. For vePT holders, the Phemex Lending Protocol offers an exclusive 30% discount on borrowing rates, underscoring our commitment to rewarding the loyalty of our expanding Web3 community. It\u2019s another step toward integrating DeFi mainstays such as borrowing and lending services into our own highly efficient ecosystem while maintaining trust and transparency.\nCT: Why did you choose to focus on the borrowing and lending aspect of the crypto markets within the Phemexia ecosystem?\nSC: We\u2019ve rolled out our hybrid DeFi stack with the Phemex Lending Protocol recognizing the user appetite for diverse financial products. Users crave the autonomy to manage their assets through DeFi integrations without sacrificing the smooth user experience offered by centralized platforms.\nOur recent upgrades to the Lending Protocol now allow users to supply liquidity and, in turn, earn the potential for significant interest returns. While such functionality is common in the DeFi space, Phemex sets itself apart as a hybrid exchange by integrating the best features of both worlds. Our users enjoy the sovereignty over their assets that DeFi provides, bolstered by additional security protocols designed to reduce the risks related to smart contract vulnerabilities and unpredictable fluctuations in borrowing rates.\nBy prioritizing borrowing and lending, we offer a comprehensive solution to meet the increasing user demand, excelling in what we do best \u2014 creating an inclusive financial ecosystem that delivers a frictionless experience for our users.\nCT: You\u2019ve also recently launched Pulse, quickly gaining popularity among users. What exciting features can traders look forward to in Season 3 of Pulse?\nWe are diligently refining Pulse, our SocialFi platform, by incorporating user feedback to enhance its core service.\nThis season, we are boosting the daily prize pool to 10,000 PT and rolling out new features like \u201Ccast\u201D and \u201Ctip\u201D to encourage and reward high-quality content. Cast refers to the content posted on Pulse, while Tip is an interactive method to reward exceptional casts. The tipping feature allows you to acknowledge and incentivize the content creators whose insights significantly benefit our community. The greater the number of tips your Casts receive and the more you tip high-quality Casts, the more crypto rewards you\u2019ll reap. Pulse is evolving into a space where trading meets with trending topics, and we\u2019re delighted to facilitate this convergence.\nWe\u2019re committed to fostering a vibrant community where quality engagement is acknowledged and rewarded, so I advise all crypto enthusiasts to stay tuned for Pulse updates.\nCT: What future developments can users expect from Phemex?\nSC: Beyond our current lending offerings, we\u2019re excited about the diverse range of products awaiting launch. Topping our agenda is the automated market maker (AMM) protocol, designed to empower users to contribute to our exchange\u2019s liquidity and reap the benefits of passive earnings. We are also laying the groundwork for an on-chain credit scoring mechanism, underpinned by our soulbound token, to revolutionize the way users access decentralized finance. Of course, we are dedicated to continually enhancing Pulse based on the valuable feedback from our community. We have a full schedule ahead at Phemex, and our team is devoted to providing the finest trading experience to all our users.\nLearn more about Phemex\n#Blockchain\n#Cryptocurrency Exchange\n#Lending\n#DeFi\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

However, two decades of digitization have shown that preparing and distributing content in a digital format is not enough to lower the barriers to scholarly information.\nPeer review, a vital process to ensure the quality and accuracy of published academic work, is still notoriously inefficient. The slow and opaque processes lead to delays in publishing new research. On top of that, most researchers from smaller institutions or developing countries have to face an uphill battle in gaining visibility and accessing mainstream scientific platforms.\nDue to the heavily centralized nature of such platforms, maintaining control and rights over one\u2019s scientific data and findings becomes another challenge for most researchers. All in all, these challenges lead to a slower pace of scientific advancement and collaboration, often discouraging researchers and limiting the diversity of contributions in the scientific community.\nBlockchain technology can potentially improve various processes of scientific publishing, offering a solution to key challenges across the board. The immutability, transparency and global availability of blockchain present an opportunity for science circles to take a major step toward decentralization while giving power and governance to users and researchers.\nStepping into decentralized science\nNobleBlocks is a blockchain-based decentralized science (DeSci) platform that promises to address critical pain points in scientific publishing. Built on the Internet Computer Protocol, a blockchain infrastructure known for its speed and scalability, NobleBlocks offers high-speed and transparent transactions to minimize the time and complexity typically associated with publishing scientific research.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nKey to NobleBlocks\u2019 mission of incentivizing scientific contribution is NOBL, the platform\u2019s native token, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain. NobleBlocks uses its custom ckNOBL solution to integrate the Ethereum-based NOBL with the Internet Computer blockchain, enhancing the decentralization aspect of the DeSci platform and ensuring a seamless and secure connection between two robust blockchain ecosystems.\nThe tokenization of scientific efforts enables DeSci to acknowledge and reward every contributor \u2014 from editor to reviewer \u2014 in a fair model. As a globally accessible portal, NobleBlocks allows researchers to expand their projects\u2019 horizons through partnerships with international researchers.\nMaking scientific work efficient and accessible\nNobleBlocks provides a streamlined system on blockchain that significantly reduces the time from research submission to publication, fixing inefficient peer review processes.\nThe platform democratizes access to essential research material globally by offering all researchers an open and easy-to-access platform. NobleBlocks also establishes data sovereignty and the integrity of scientific work by allowing researchers to retain control over their intellectual property \u2014 a crucial factor in encouraging original and diverse scientific contributions.\nPublications and contributions can be seen from the dashboard. Source: NobleBlocks\nIntegrating the decentralized nature of blockchain with conventional scientific publishing practices is no easy task. To achieve it, NobleBlocks harmonized the rigors of academic peer review with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain. The resulting solution has enabled the preservation of the integrity of the scientific process while opening doors to faster, more equitable access to research.\nAs a fully on-chain platform, NobleBlocks ensures complete transparency and immutability of scientific data and publications. Being fully on-chain allows every transaction, submission and review process to be recorded on the blockchain, offering enhanced security and trust in the hosted academic content.\nA platform for science communities\nAside from providing a platform for publishing and reviewing scientific work, NobleBlocks also builds a network to connect researchers, academicians and thought leaders from diverse disciplines and geographies. It seeks to contribute to a richer and more inclusive scientific dialogue by encouraging collaboration, idea exchange and collective problem-solving.\nThe platform offers detailed information about a researcher through quick profiles. Source: NobleBlocks\nThe concept of making scientific research globally accessible through blockchain has raised interest from both the Web3 ecosystem and the scientific communities. Aside from receiving grants from the Dfinity Foundation, a major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain, NobleBlocks also enjoyed a rapid sell-out for NOBL in under one minute.\nBlockchain in science\nNobleBlocks envisions an open, transparent and efficient scientific publishing landscape enhanced by blockchain technology. It anticipates a shift toward more accessible and participatory scientific processes that reduce barriers and improve efficiency.\nBy merging scientific publishing with blockchain, the platform aims to contribute to this evolution. NobleBlocks promises to reshape how research is shared and accessed, enhancing the integrity and value of scientific work.\nFor the broader crypto and Web3 ecosystem, NobleBlocks exemplifies the practical application of blockchain in non-financial sectors through the utilization of DeSci. The platform offers a model for integrating blockchain into academia, encouraging similar adaptations in other areas and advancing the entire Web3 ecosystem.\nLearn more about NobleBlocks\n#Blockchain\n#Science\n#Decentralization\n#Adoption\n#Internet Computer\nDisclaimer.

Central to these challenges is the lack of transparency, security and individual control over personal data. In the existing paradigm, large organizations often collect and store vast amounts of personal data, sometimes exploiting the data for commercial gains without explicit user consent or fair compensation to the data owners. This is especially true when explored through the lens of the explosive growth of AI, where centralized organizations use our data without explicit consent to train and deploy AI systems.\nData breaches are also increasingly common, exposing sensitive personal information and leading to potential financial and reputational damage for individuals. The centralized nature of data storage systems often makes them attractive targets for cyberattacks. Additionally, the current systems lack sufficient mechanisms for individuals to verify where and how their data is being used, leading to mistrust and reluctance to share data.\nAre you aware of all the ways companies are collecting your personal data on a daily basis?\n\nWatch our latest video to find out more 👇🔥\n\n#dataprivacy #cookies pic.twitter.com\/ahDyZafhzM\n\u2014 Itheum (@itheum) January 13, 2023\nThere is a clear need for solutions that enhance data security, provide greater transparency in data transactions and empower individuals with control over their data. Such solutions should ensure that individuals can monitor and regulate access to their data and receive adequate compensation when their data is used commercially.\nImproving user control over data can lead to a more equitable data ecosystem where privacy is respected and data exchanges are conducted fairly and transparently. This approach would protect individuals and build trust, encouraging more open and beneficial data sharing across platforms.\nThe blockchain impact on data ownership\nBlockchain and Web3 technologies address several of these issues by decentralizing data storage and management, thus reducing the risk of centralized points of failure and unauthorized access. Blockchain provides an immutable ledger, offering a transparent and verifiable record of transactions, which enhances trust among parties in data exchanges. Transparent, verifiable records are instrumental in scenarios where data accuracy and history are crucial, such as in supply chain management or personal health records.\nMoreover, Web3 introduces concepts such as self-sovereign identity, allowing individuals to own and control their digital identities without reliance on central authorities. Through smart contracts, users can automate permissions and conditions under which their data is accessed or shared, ensuring they retain control and potentially receive compensation for their data\u2019s use.\nThese technologies also facilitate the creation of decentralized marketplaces for data exchange, where individuals and organizations can trade data in a secure, peer-to-peer environment. The opportunity can lead to more equitable data markets, where users are adequately compensated and data usage is transparent and consensual.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nWhat challenges exist in ensuring the authenticity and reliability of data in decentralized platforms?\nOne of the primary concerns is verifying data sources and the integrity of the data itself. In decentralized environments, where there is no central authority to oversee and validate information, mechanisms must be in place to prevent the dissemination of false or corrupted data.\nUtilizing blockchain technology to tokenize and unlock large volumes of \u201Cpassive\u201D data from various creators necessitates a robust system to distinguish between legitimate users and malicious actors or automated bots. Such a system should be underpinned by strong crypto-economic game theory principles, which can help incentivize good behavior and penalize bad, enhancing data reliability.\nFurthermore, the decentralized nature of these platforms often means that data comes from a wide array of sources, which can vary significantly in reliability and intent. The diversity requires sophisticated algorithms and consensus mechanisms to ensure that only accurate and verified data is accepted and maintained within the system. Ensuring consistency and reliability in such an environment demands continuous improvement and adaptation of these technologies to cope with evolving threats and maintain the data ecosystem\u2019s integrity.\nHow can bonding and staking mechanisms improve trust and accountability in data exchange networks?\nFor instance, the Itheum Protocol introduces bonding and staking mechanisms to enhance trust and accountability within its decentralized data exchange network. By implementing a system where data creators must deposit a slashable bond during the Data NFT minting process, Itheum ensures creators have a financial stake in maintaining high-quality, reliable data outputs.\nThe slashable bond, held for a period determined by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), incentivizes good behavior by making it costly to engage in detrimental actions, as premature withdrawal results in significant penalties. Itheum Protocol\u2019s mechanisms secure the network against bad actors and establish a foundation of trust for data consumers, who can rely on the integrity of the data thanks to the transparent accountability enforced through staking.\nBreaking Barriers!🌟#DataNFT enthusiasts, the moment is here!\n\nAll current and future Data NFTs are now accessible on any @MultiversX #NFT marketplace or platform.\n\nWith this update, Data NFTs provide all the utility of regular NFTs but add so much more.\n\nWhy NFT when you can\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/PY0Qsz8JOM\n\u2014 Itheum (@itheum) December 23, 2023\nData Creator Bonding is now available on the Itheum Protocol. Interested parties can access the feature here.\nThe role of reputation score in data markets\nIn Itheum Protocol\u2019s ecosystem, the \u201CLiveliness\u201D score plays a crucial role in shaping the reputation of participants within the data market. The Liveliness score measures a participant\u2019s reputation, activity and advocacy within the data economy, influencing their trustworthiness and the perceived value of their data.\nAs participants engage more actively and responsibly in the ecosystem, their Liveliness score increases, signaling to other users and potential data consumers their commitment and reliability. The reputation score dynamic incentivizes participants to maintain high standards of participation, as a higher Liveliness score can lead to better data trade opportunities and greater rewards.\nHow can bonding periods and penalties enhance data authenticity?\nBonding periods and associated penalties are critical in enhancing the authenticity of data within the Itheum protocol. When data creators commit to a bonding period, they signal their long-term commitment to the platform and its users. The period acts as a guarantee of the creator\u2019s ongoing activity and integrity, with the full knowledge that exiting the bond early or engaging in malpractice will result in substantial financial penalties.\nThe penalties deter potential bad actors and reassure data consumers of the creator\u2019s authenticity and dedication. Additionally, the option for creators to renew their bond, which resets their Liveliness score to the maximum, continuously reinforces the trust between data creators and consumers, fostering a healthier and more reliable data marketplace.\nThrough the strategic use of bonding, staking and reputation scoring, Itheum Protocol creates a robust ecosystem where data authenticity, accountability and trust are prioritized. Itheum Protocol\u2019s mechanisms ensure that only good actors with good intentions thrive, promoting a community-curated improvement of data quality in a \u201Crules without rulers\u201D environment.\nLearn more about Itheum Protocol\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Data\n#Web3\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.

Both shared their views on the factors behind the rapid growth of RWAs and why they believe \u201Cbig institutions\u201D such as BlackRock are bullish on the asset class.\nCointelegraph: What would you say is the driving factor behind the rapid growth of RWAs this year?\nVictor Sanchez: Interest has always existed due to the obvious advantages: removing middlemen (and their costs), an incredibly liquid and efficient 24\/7 market and a transparent ledger. RWAs and TradFi have now found a counterparty safe, secure, composable and usable space in places and processes like the ones we implemented at Kinto.\nTokenized treasury products gre 782% in 2023, worth over $931 million as of Feb. 1. Source: CoinGecko\nCT: Can you share your views on why BlackRock has suddenly become quite bullish on RWAs?\nVS: RWAs are a multitrillion-dollar opportunity, and these big institutions are aware that blockchain technologies can go from 0 to 100 in a single bull market.\nReal-world assets\u2019 total market capitalization. Source: Galaxy Research\nI honestly believe missing that train was simply not an option despite the day-one issues of being welcomed with a Tornado Cash dusting.\nCT: Could you elaborate in a few sentences about what types of liquidity can be unlocked from RWAs and how this increases the bottom line for money managers?\nAlan Keegan: Being able to transfer assets globally, 24\/7, with T+0 settlement by itself is a huge benefit blockchains offer once the regulatory hurdles of using them to transfer securities are overcome.\nHowever, the ability to have any arbitrary transaction neutrally and atomically enforced makes a lot of transaction types easier and more cost-efficient. This means overcollateralized borrowing, yield stripping, claiming collateral on bad debt, and even issuing dollar-pegged stablecoins as liquidity against treasury collateral at close to 100% LTV [loan-to-value] can be automatically done with a click of a button or triggered based on conditions.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nIt\u2019s difficult to think of any transaction type that won\u2019t be improved by being on-chain once we\u2019ve done the regulatory work to actually use the blockchain as the financial infrastructure layer and unlock its potential.\nCT: In terms of fragmented and stranded liquidity, what are the areas of unlocked capital that RWAs can free up, and how might this process take place?\nVS: RWAs face a unique liquidity and usability problem. The last bull and bear markets proved to institutions that for some transaction types, DeFi infrastructure offers benefits vs. traditional alternatives and operates smoothly even in extreme market conditions \u2014 in passive liquidity provision and overcollateralized lending, for example.\nHowever, despite being tokenized, most RWAs today aren\u2019t usable for any of this on-chain. We can only unlock the value the institutions are looking for by doing KYC on the chain level while remaining an open network.\nCT: Is there a difference between DeFi and RWAs?\nVS: There are a few, but the lines are starting to blur, and that is a good thing. Many of the RWAs that are starting to get tokenized today are highly regulated products in the real world with strict counterparty requirements.\n\u201CHistorically, RWAs were missing a key aspect of DeFi: composability. We are fixing that.\u201D\nCT: Can you explain how RWAs fix the composability issue that plagues DeFi?\nAs of today, RWAs require their own compliance framework, KYC systems, etc. Essentially, they are controlling who you are, what you own and who you can send it to. If you think about this problem on an L1 or on non-KYC\u2019d L2s, it basically means that even for a very similar use case on different DApps or protocols, you need to go through their process, and they do not \u201Ctalk to each other.\u201D\nThis is why we believe the right abstraction model is to KYC at the L2 level so everyone is under the same set of rules and capabilities, allowing RWAs to free flow, compose and more.\nHow RWA bridges the gap between TradFi and Defi. Source: Binance Research\nCT: What are the current counterparty challenges with TradFi requirements for managing counterparty risk?\nIn any network, it does not matter if we are talking about an L1 or an L2, you are free to send anything to anyone, 24\/7. That is the promise of crypto, and it is great in 99.9% of cases.\nHowever, in a compliance environment where you need to know exactly who sends you what and why, this becomes a true counterparty-compliance nightmare.\n\u201CIn our conversations with Trad-Fi, this counterparty issue is one of the most cited reasons for not being on-chain, followed by security and usability.\u201D\nCT: What is Kinto doing to bridge the gap between TradFi and RWAs?\nVS: Kinto is the safety-first L2. In Kinto, every individual or corporation is KYC\/KYB [Know Your Business] at the chain level. This information never leaves the KYC provider without user permission (we call this user-owned KYC), and it solves the counterparty requirements. \nOn top of that, by doing this at the chain level, we enable, for the first time, the composability for these RWAs, allowing for products that can only exist on Kinto.\nCT: It seems like RWAs are mainly for institutional investors and fund managers. How and when will retail investors be able to get a slice of the RWA pie?\nVS: Due to the regulation we covered in previous questions, it was easy for these institutions and accredited investors to access these products.\nHowever, as we facilitate counterparty requirements and other security elements (AML, fraud detection, Sybil resistance, etc.) protocols, we will be able to offer products to a much larger audience in Kinto than anywhere else.\nCT: What is your utopian vision of what full RWA mainstreaming looks like in TradFi, and how would that benefit the average investor?\nAK: Here is the dream for the future of Kinto. On Kinto, tokenized traditional ETFs could be provided as liquidity in an AMM like Uniswap or Curve. Your bank could be linked to your wallet, which is also used for payroll on-chain, and automatically approves and issues a mortgage using funds from an on-chain money market and the tokenized deed to your house as collateral.\nCorporate treasuries could be held in on-chain assets, and corporate debt issuance could happen through a DApp. Any modern financial asset can be issued and traded on-chain, and any modern financial service can be provided on-chain.\n\u201COur mission is not just to provide the first permissionless, decentralized network capable of supporting every traditional financial institution and every decentralized finance protocol. It is to provide the best infrastructure option for hosting the entire future financial system.\u201D\nGet Access to Real-Time\nTrade Alerts Now\nClick Here For Instant Access\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This concept is expanded upon with leveraged tokens, which are backed by perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures contracts enable users to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date.\nLeveraged tokens bridge the gap between centralized exchanges (CEX) and the innovative, user-friendly approaches of decentralized finance (DeFi).\nDespite their benefits, leveraged tokens may encounter network congestion on blockchains with limited transaction capacity \u2014 especially on networks such as Ethereum, where transaction fees peak during congestion, the value of positions can be eroded and leverage support remains limited.\nTo overcome high transaction fees, money markets such as Aave and Compound operate on layer-2 blockchain networks, which are more efficient but still far from perfect. The number of assets supported by money markets such as Aave and Compound is limited, and the amount of leverage that users can acquire is very limited. Leveraged tokens that are built on top of money markets incur expensive rebalancing that can eat away at users' principal.\nIn response to these shortcomings, TLX has introduced leveraged tokens that are backed by perpetual futures contracts, which allows the leveraged tokens model to be both scalable and efficient.\nThe Uniswap for perpetual futures\nTLX, a DeFi platform built on Optimism \u2014 a layer-2 network on Ethereum \u2014 presents a permissionless, noncustodial leveraged token landscape.

Source: TLX\nTLX aims to become 'the Uniswap of the perpetual futures market.' Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on Ethereum that enables users to trade crypto directly from their wallets without the need for an intermediary, using an automated market maker.\nLike Uniswap, TLX works via a simple swap UI. Users can create long or short positions with up to 20x leverage using TLX. All leveraged tokens minted on TLX maintain a constant leveraged factor and do not require any margin management.\nPerpetual futures contracts of the Synthetix protocol back TLX leveraged tokens (LTs). Synthetix is a DeFi protocol that makes it possible to create synthetic assets that simulate the value of underlying assets. Utilizing synthetic assets, users can access a wide range of markets without directly owning the underlying assets.\nSimplifying leveraged trading\nTLX intends to position itself as a transformative platform within the DeFi space. Its main goal is bringing scalable and efficient leveraged tokens to DeFi. While enhancing the inclusivity and accessibility of leveraged trading strategies, TLX also wants to contribute to the overall liquidity and dynamism of the crypto markets.\nComprised of experienced professionals with doctorates in computer science and machine learning, the TLX team works to broaden the adoption of leveraged tokens. Involved in academic research in decentralized finance, the team leverages its experience in delivering a viable LT product to overcome current market challenges.\nPortfolio screen of the TLX platform. Source: TLX\nLooking toward the future, a more accessible leveraged trading experience, as facilitated by platforms like TLX, could significantly benefit the crypto ecosystem. DeFi protocols that support LTs can lower the barriers to entry for retail investors, allowing them to participate in sophisticated trading strategies that were previously out of reach.\nThe adoption of leveraged tokens could transform how market participants access leverage by offering investors a method of leveraged trading that is both simple to use and easy to access. This combined with the composable nature of leveraged tokens could also spur innovation in financial products and the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem.\nLearn more about TLX\n#Blockchain\n#Cryptocurrencies\n#Ethereum\n#Investments\n#Tokens\n#DeFi\n#Layer2\nDisclaimer.

Helio operates out of London with a team of 15 people. \nThe advent of newer blockchain networks is beginning to bridge the gap, but not without teething issues, as Paumen said:\n\u201CNow with the second generation of blockchains like Solana, even though there\u2019s a lot of talk about congestion, we actually have the engineering resources to figure it out.\u201D\nHelio was founded by Paumen and chief technology officer Jim Walker in March 2022. The pair had previously exited a successful startup and shifted into the crypto sector. Paumen says they were excited by the prospect of Solana\u2019s high TPS and fast finality as the basis of building a new crypto payment platform.\n\u201CEver since someone paid 10,000 BTC for a pizza, crypto payments became a thing. But the user experience sucked. You had 20-minute payment times or payments not being processed at all,\u201D Paumen said.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

According to Paumen, the platform facilitates $30 million in monthly payments but still mainly caters to the Web3 space on both the user and merchant fronts.\nIt has also made waves in the Solana ecosystem, facilitating the sale of some 80,000 Solana mobile phones through its payment plugin. Helio's high-profile integrations include managing the Solana Pay plugin on Shopify and its WooCommerce plugin. \nHelio has been operating the Solana Pay plugin on Shopify since December 2023.

But you need to assume that you're a crypto-fluent user, and that's a very small percentage,\u201D Paumen admits.\nProgress will likely be gradual, as more crypto-curious users begin to use Web3 wallet and make payments in their token of choice. Paumen also says that the onboarding user experience needs to improve to be accessible to a wide demographic of users.\nHelio's platform allows merchants to accept a variety of cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services. Source: Helio\n\u201CWe talk about this concept of crypto granny internally. What we mean is, when crypto granny buys a Bored Ape hoodie for her grandson, she needs to be able to do that without owning crypto, without even knowing what blockchain is,\u201D Paumen added.\nHelio\u2019s CEO concluded by saying that the future could see the likes of Apple Pay potentially settling payments on their own blockchain. However, he said he firmly believes in the idea of a decentralized way to send money worldwide \u201Cwithout intermediaries, with fast or instant settlement with low fees.\u201D\n\u201CI think it\u2019s just a really powerful technology. We\u2019re still early. The fact that Visa is partnering with Solana is a great signal, though.\u201D\nWhile onboarding major e-commerce platforms is the lowest-hanging fruit for mass adoption, Paumen believes that streaming platforms like Vimeo and even OnlyFans also present an excellent platform for the utility of crypto payments. \nMagazine: Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?\nExchange or buy SOL\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

It encompasses various components such as indexers, which organize blockchain data, and remote procedure calls (RPCs), enabling network interactions to function as if they were local. Additionally, middleware includes oracles and decentralized data storage services, which are software solutions that transfer real-world data to the blockchain.\nWhile middleware enhances the scalability and usability of DApps, its inherently centralized structure poses significant challenges. This centralization can lead to instability and risks a single entity gaining control, which threatens the core principles of decentralization within the Web3 ecosystem.\nTo address these concerns, the Web3 community is actively developing alternatives to reinforce the decentralization of the middleware layer. These efforts ensure the infrastructure remains robust and true to the decentralized ethos.\nInfrastructure for a decentralized future\nIn line with these developments, SubQuery Network offers a scalable and unified data infrastructure that supports the vision of a decentralized future. The platform offers a suite of tools designed to empower developers to bring DApps to life without compromising speed, flexibility and efficiency. SubQuery is assisting developers globally, with full support for over 160 networks, including many outside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) family.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nWith its native token, SQT, SubQuery integrates two core services \u2014 indexing and RPC \u2014 into a single decentralized network. Thus, users can access fully decentralized services (for example purchasing a plan for an RPC endpoint) with the simplicity of Web2 alternatives.\nThe platform tests the network\u2019s load capacity through its free offerings. Additionally, the network is transforming with the beta launch of the SubQuery Data Node. The redesign of the structure and query language of RPCs leads to significant performance increases. Preliminary results show that the SubQuery Data Node enables the data indexer to run 3.9 times faster than The Graph.\nThe role of middleware on Web3 decentralization\nWhen discussing the evolution of Web3 decentralization, James Bayly, chief operating officer of SubQuery Network, emphasized middleware\u2019s critical role:\n\u201CThe next era of Web3 decentralization will be in the middleware, the final frontier against centralized services and industry titans.\u201D\nBayly pointed out the challenges faced by developers, stating, \u201CDevelopers have long had to sacrifice performance and reliability when building DApps, we are working to make these sacrifices a thing of the past.\u201D Bayly also highlighted that \u201Cmany leading DApps are utterly reliant on centralized middleware components that could be turned off at any moment.\u201D\nThe Web3 community focuses on making middleware more decentralized, paving the way for a secure, user-friendly and public digital environment. As we progress, the number of choices available to developers in Web3 will only increase.\nLearn more about SubQuery Network\n#Blockchain\n#Business\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: \u201CPulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.\u201D\n  Read more\nSuch a breakout has never been seen before, and multiple analysts agree, including eToro crypto analyst Simon Peters.\nMiners \u2018better shaped\u2019 for halving this time\nThe never-seen-before Bitcoin price appreciation pre-halving has potentially had a positive impact on the mining industry as miners obtained more control over mining costs.\n\u201CIn comparison to the previous halving, it appears miners are in better shape overall in terms of lower levels of debt and potentially better control over their costs, such as electricity,\u201D Fidelity Digital Assets\u2019 director of research Chris Kuiper told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\u201CWhat\u2019s also helping miners this cycle is the price appreciation before the halving \u2014 something that also hasn\u2019t been seen in previous cycles.\u201D\nSince the third halving in May 2020, Bitcoin mining energy consumption has significantly increased, surging from around 50 Terawatt hours (Twh) to 99 Twh on April 18, 2024.\nBitcoin energy consumption. Source: Digiconomist\nAt the same time, the amount of Bitcoin network\u2019s energy consumption powered by renewable energy sources has also increased, with renewables accounting for 54.5% BTC mining consumption as of January 2024, according to Bitcoin ESG Forecast. As of September 2020, this figure stood at 39%, according to data from CCAF.\nFirst Bitcoin halving with spot BTC ETFs in the U.S.\nOne of the most straightforward things about Bitcoin halving 2024 is that this halving is the first ever with BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) enabled in the United States.\nAfter many years of efforts, spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted trading in January 2024, opening exposure to Bitcoin for institutional investors.\nRelated: Not just the halving: Why analysts are bullish on Bitcoin in 2024\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen \u201Cblockbuster success,\u201D which apparently reflects a spike in demand for Bitcoin.\nSource: Eric Balchunas\nSince the first day of trading, all ten spot Bitcoin ETFs combined have increased their holdings by at least 220,000 BTC, which is worth around $14 billion at the time of writing.\nBlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF has attracted the biggest amount of inflows among 10 BTC ETFs, with its holdings surging more than 10,000% from just 2,621 BTC on the trading debut to 273,140 BTC on April 18.\nM2 CEO Stefan Kimmel said:\nLooking at the broader landscape, while halving garners attention, we are cognizant that it's just a part of a larger narrative. The confluence of ETFs, quantitative easing, and halving will define the future contours of the market.\nBitcoin became more globally decentralized and secure\nBitcoin has also significantly improved in terms of network security and decentralization. Since 2020 \u2014 when most new Bitcoin was mined in Mainland China \u2014 Bitcoin has emerged as a more distributed network.\nJust four years ago, Bitcoin mining in China amounted to nearly 80% of Bitcoin\u2019s total mining hash rate globally. As of February 2024, the biggest Bitcoin mining countries are the United States with 40% of the total hashrate, as well as China and Russia, accounting for 15% and 12%, respectively, according to Hashlab Mining founder Jaran Mellerud.\nGeographic distribution of Bitcoin hash rate between September 2019 and January 2022. Source: CBECI\n\u201CThis geographic decentralization is continuing as miners migrate to Africa and Latin America to take advantage of cheaper electricity prices,\u201D Mellerud said.\nAdditionally, the Bitcoin blockchain has become more resistant to attacks as its hash rate has surged five times since the previous halving.\n\u201CIt now requires five times more computing power and associated electricity supply, electrical infrastructure, and mining hardware to attack the network,\u201D Hashlab Mining founder noted.\nMagazine: Bitcoin Halving will pump games, Shrapnel\u2019s \u2018simple\u2019 secret revealed: Web3 Gamer\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

Or maybe, the task that we all had on how to bring users from Telegram to crypto. So basically, that was the original goal.\u201D\nThe executive explained that his team spent years looking at Telegram\u2019s massive user base and the TON blockchain, which had \u201Calmost zero action but had really good technology.\u201D\nAfter going through the process, the team decided to go with the approach of simplifying the start of the onboarding process. Plotvinov explained:\n\u201CAt some point you just, you know, come to the idea. All right. So we just need to remove all the roadblocks for the beginning. Then, we need to give something to users so they have the motivation to go for all this Web3.\u201D\nThe Notcoin co-creator said it became a very \u201Csocial thing,\u201D with interactions, competitions, leaderboards and squads. \u201CIt\u2019s very, very important for such a game.

Blockchain is expected to penetrate 4.3% of the payment industry by 2025, as per a Cointelegraph Research report, suggesting a 95% growth potential.\nHowever, blockchain networks must solve fundamental problems to benefit from their untapped potential. Scalability and interoperability are highlighted as the primary shortcomings in individual blockchain use, and industry experts emphasize the need for blockchains to be interconnected rather than functioning as isolated entities.\nPolkadot 2.0 to solve blockchain\u2019s inherent problems\nPolkadot, an open-source multichain protocol, enhances cross-chain transfers of data and assets through a network of specialized blockchains. Polkadot\u2019s structure aims to solve key blockchain issues like interoperability, scalability and security by allowing different blockchains to transfer data and assets.\nPotential coretime configurations in Polkadot 2.0. Source: Polkadot\nThrough its parallel chains \u2014 parachains \u2014 which enable numerous transactions simultaneously, the network introduces a new vision with Polkadot 2.0. The introduction of coretime, designed to adapt computational resources in real-time to meet the network\u2019s needs more efficiently, is at the core of Polkadot 2.0.\nCoretime denotes the availability of validator subsets as computational resources, or cores, for processing parachain blocks within the Polkadot network. Presently, Polkadot supports 50 such cores. These cores operate simultaneously, handling numerous complex tasks. Consequently, Polkadot is often dubbed the \"Polkadot Supercomputer,\" signifying its collective capacity to manage a vast array of tasks concurrently.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nPolkadot 2.0 introduces a dynamic core model that significantly enhances the platform\u2019s capabilities. A core is a flexible, cost-efficient blockchain model that allows developers to access the Polkadot network\u2019s security and interoperability on a pay-as-you-go basis without needing a dedicated parachain slot. Smaller projects with intermittent blockchain resource needs can benefit from Polkadot\u2019s robust ecosystem through coretimes without the cost of leasing an entire parachain, which was a requirement in Polkadot 1.0.\nBesides cores, Polkadot uses a sharding mechanism that enhances scalability and increases transaction throughput. With the ability to validate up to 20 shards per block and the potential to grow to 100 shards, Polkadot boasts a transaction speed of approximately 1 million transactions per second (TPS) with asynchronous backing, compared to Ethereum 2.0\u2019s throughput of 100,000 TPS.\nCoretime marketplace and improved governance\nThe coretime marketplace in Polkadot 2.0 allows developers to purchase block time dynamically and efficiently scale their operations, matching their computational and consensus needs. The revenue generated from these sales essentially functions as rental income.\nWith Polkadot 2.0\u2019s scalability, decentralized applications (DApps) can dynamically adjust their resource usage based on demand. DApp developers can seamlessly integrate assets and functionalities across multiple blockchains, expanding the available market and liquidity pools.\nAiming to use a deflationary mechanism, Polkadot presented a proposal to burn the revenue from coretime sales. This decision is expected to make DOT more attractive for long-term retention, consistent with the network\u2019s goals of improving security and efficiency across its ecosystem.\nPolkadot 2.0\u2019s OpenGov enhances the platform\u2019s governance structures, making them more democratic and inclusive. The governance model allows Polkadot\nDOT\n$7.09\ntokenholders to participate directly in decision-making.\nPolkadot differentiates itself from other blockchain networks by collaborating with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and says that its products are considered software, not securities. In this way, Polkadot aims to ensure compliance with securities laws and frame its native token, DOT, as a technology-focused asset rather than a financial instrument.\nChallenges and future outlook\nPolkadot stands as a pivotal and innovative presence in the blockchain sphere, striving to redefine the interoperability and scalability of diverse networks. With its multichain structure, Polkadot enhances scalability, interoperability and flexibility, which are key to the evolving Web3 framework.\nThe shift to Polkadot 2.0 signifies the platform\u2019s proactive evolution, addressing many early challenges with more adaptable and efficient solutions. As with any emerging technology, the ongoing evolution and adaptation of the Polkadot network are critical to achieving widespread adoption and maintaining relevance in the swiftly progressing blockchain field.\nAs Polkadot continues to develop, its success in leveraging its unique capabilities and overcoming its challenges will play a crucial role in defining its position within the broader blockchain ecosystem.

It\u2019s a technology of freedom. We care about freedom. Even our logo, the paper airplane symbolizes freedom to move in three dimensions,\u201D Durov said.\nThe founder of the app, which reportedly has over 900 million monthly users, said the company strives to give its users the ability to build tools, apps and businesses on Telegram.\nRelated: TON continues to attract Web3 firms as Telegram Ad Platform goes live\nDurov said Telegram has adopted a different approach to monetizing user bases than other major messaging and social media platforms, which sell user data to advertisers. Telegram recently announced plans to share revenue with content generators on its platform through its Ad Network.\nDurov described the move as one of the most generous revenue-sharing models in the history of social media. He also said that 50% of the revenue Telegram receives from displaying ads and broadcast channels would be shared with channel owners and content creators using TON\u2019s network:\n\u201CAll these transactions, the payments for ads, withdrawals of ads are powered by blockchain. We will use the TON blockchain exclusively for that.\u201D\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

According to the founder, this in-platform market generated $350 million in sales and he said that tokenizing other elements of its platform is in the pipeline:\n\u201CThe next step that we are going to undertake is tokenizing Telegram stickers.\u201D\nDurov said that Telegram needs the scalability afforded by TON\u2019s network, which can process tens to hundreds of millions of transactions in the future.\nFollowing Durov\u2019s address at the conference, stablecoin operator Tether announced the launch of U.S. dollar-pegged USDT\nUSDT\n$1.00\ntoken on the TON network. Tether also unveiled the launch gold-pegged Tether Gold (XAUT) stablecoin on TON.\nTON was initially developed by Telegram, but a subsequent legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission saw the messaging application abandon its development efforts in May 2020.\nA small group of open-source developers then took over the project, which led to the establishment of the TON Foundation in May 2021.\nMagazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin\u2019: Why hip hop stars love crypto\nExchange or buy TON\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

From Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana to Avalanche, memecoins have made fortunes and ruined portfolios in recent months.\n\u201CThey\u2019re great for the space because they bring people in, they keep them excited, occupied and concentrated on what the technology can do,\u201D Gün Sirer said.\nThe CEO of Ava Labs conceded that many critics argue that memecoins bring no value to the ecosystem, just as the rise of nonfungible tokens had detractors.

That purpose is social signaling. In the same way that some people use a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT as a profile picture, they\u2019re saying I made so much money off trading that I can afford this,\u201D Gün Sirer explained.\nThe Ava Labs CEO said that most memecoin traders are not holding tokens long-term and that the nature of the emergent trend relies on the ability to constantly adjust to the movement of value between different memecoins.\n\u201CThey don\u2019t see it as an investment in that fashion. They see it as a transitory phase. It\u2019s like riding a bike.

Besides, users started to prioritize security and custody solutions. Their regulatory awareness has also grown.\nDue to the increasing demand for crypto payments, merchants across various industries are searching for payment partners.

Blockchain-based systems make it transparent and resistant to interference.\nUsing GPS-based navigation devices has become ubiquitous. People use tools such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and Foursquare, which rely on GPS. However, these services are plagued by a common fault \u2014 centralization \u2014 which makes them prone to opaque functioning and a central point of failure when it comes to hacking.\nBlockchain technology offers several advantages over centralized systems and helps users tide over the limitations of traditional tools like GPS mapping. It improves transparency, increases resilience to hacking attempts and enables faster data processing. Unsurprisingly, several businesses have begun to use blockchain technology or are actively exploring its application.\nThe inefficiencies in current interactive maps\nThough the current system of GPS-based interactive maps has been around for more than a decade, it has its share of inefficiencies. The data from these systems may sometimes be inaccurate and slow to load on devices.\nGPS mapping entails processing and storing enormous amounts of data, usually on centralized servers, which might cause delays when accessing and sharing. As these technologies track a person\u2019s whereabouts in real time, they may jeopardize user privacy. Traditional GPS system development and maintenance might also be prohibitively expensive for businesses.\nCentralized mapping relies on proprietary data that may be outdated, failing to adequately reflect recent advances in roads, highways and infrastructure due to rapid change. GPS also faces difficulty in adequately mapping dense metropolitan areas. Creating interactive maps in regions with narrow lanes necessitates hard work from the mapping provider to document each area, which is both time-consuming and costly. Moreover, in civil applications such as surveying and transportation, GPS is unencrypted, lacks proof-of-origin or authentication features and is susceptible to cyberattacks, jamming and spoofing. \nMost mapping projects use crowdsourcing to enable their operations. In OpenStreetMap, for instance, a large number of contributors use GPS devices, aerial imagery and low-tech field maps to update map data. As the world pushes into the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), new crowdsourcing use cases are likely to emerge. However, problems like difficulty with accuracy and top-down policy implementation \u2014 which crowdsourcing projects have generally grappled with \u2014 may pervade. Blockchain-based mapping provides a viable alternative.\nHow blockchain augments interactive digital maps\nThe decentralized structure blockchain technology works on may provide effective answers to common difficulties in the usual interactive digital maps.\nGPS mapping requires processing and storing large amounts of data, usually stored on a single or a few servers. The centralized nature of GPS mapping can lead to processing and delivery delays due to the strain of handling large amounts of data on limited servers. Decentralized apps (DApps), however, distribute data over several network devices (nodes), reducing latency and allowing for smooth data access.\nAs these applications rely on a decentralized network of nodes to continuously validate transactions and data updates rather than a single centralized authority, they can keep location information more current and accurate. The blockchain\u2019s consensus process, which needs confirmation from several nodes before accepting changes, preserves data integrity and protects it from illegal changes.\nBetter privacy is another advantage of using blockchain for mapping. Traditional GPS mapping compels consumers to send their location data to major organizations, which can then monetize this geotagged information without the users\u2019 consent. On the other hand, Blockchain functions without centralized authority that can make unanimous decisions, with data spread across multiple nodes, improving user privacy.\nCan blockchains be used for spatial verification?\nSpatial verification in blockchain is the process of authenticating the physical location of an event, object or user within a decentralized network.\nSpatial verification refers to the confirmation that things are at the place where they claim to be. It is very useful in various industries, especially supply chain management.\nFor instance, when an Amazon delivery drone drops off a package at an owner\u2019s door, the cost is charged to the owner\u2019s account, relying on spatial verification. This eliminates problems with dishonest delivery persons and disagreements over charges for products that go missing.\nSimilarly, if someone has a broken windshield, they can use blockchain-based spatial verification to back up their insurance claim by sending a photo and documentation proving the time and location. This helps streamline insurance claim processing, reduces disputes and helps combat fraud.\nWhen one creates a new bank account remotely, spatial verification allows them to verify the residence by merely being present at their home rather than providing proof of address such as utility bill copies.\nA smart contract built in a blockchain-based proof-of-location (PoL) protocol would do spatial verification in these use cases. By providing a trustless way to prove location, PoL systems enhance transparency and efficiency in various industries.\nWhat is proof-of-location protocol?\nPoL uses a combination of cryptographic algorithms and consensus procedures to ensure the authenticity of a user\u2019s location data without relying on a single authority.\nIn blockchain, PoL is the validation of a user\u2019s physical position within a decentralized network. PoL assures the precision of location-based transactions and services in a range of applications, including supply chain management, asset tracking, decentralized finance and more. \nOne frequent approach to PoL is to use a network of trustworthy nodes or oracles to collect and validate location data from an array of sources, including GPS satellites, WiFi signals and cellphone towers. These nodes then verify the user\u2019s location by broadcasting signed messages or proofs to the blockchain. \nBy implementing PoL into blockchain systems, users can securely engage with location-conscious smart contracts and DApps while maintaining privacy and trust. This technology expands the possibilities for location-based services and enables innovative use cases that require verifiable location data on the blockchain.\nCore elements of a PoL smart contract\nLocation data submissions, verification mechanisms, data storage, and linking spatial verification to specific actions are the core elements of a PoL smart contract.\nLocation data submission\nThe smart contract would define how users or devices submit location data, including: \nGeotagged photos or videos.\nGPS coordinates from a mobile device.\nSensor readings from IoT devices confirming a location.\nVerification mechanisms\nThe contract would need ways to verify the submitted location:\nUsing reputation systems to assess the reliability of data providers.\nCross-checking with multiple data sources.\nEmploying cryptographic techniques to prevent location spoofing.\nData storage\nA tamper-proof record would be created by securely storing the verified location data on the blockchain.\nTriggering actions\nThe spatial verification would be connected to particular activities by the smart contract, such as paying out in supply chain situations, approving claims made by insurance, or granting access upon verification of physical presence.\nWhat are the limitations of a proof-of-location protocol?\nDespite its potential, PoL has several drawbacks, including reliance on external data sources, scalability difficulties and variable applicability across geographies, among others.\nWhile PoL offers several advantages, it has significant limitations. One problem is the reliance on external data sources, which can lead to vulnerabilities for manipulation or spoofing. Additionally, PoL may face scalability concerns because confirming location data for a large number of transactions demands significant processing resources.\nMoreover, PoL solutions may not be universally applicable across geographic regions or situations, resulting in inconsistent verification accuracy. There are no standardized methods for incorporating geographic locations, physical addresses or coordinates into smart contracts. \nEach developing platform has its own hardware infrastructure, protocols and business models. Addressing these restrictions is critical to the general adoption and efficacy of PoL in blockchain applications.","post_cover":null,"author":"by Dilip Kumar Patairya","title":"Mapping on the blockchain, explained","url":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/explained\/mapping-on-the-blockchain-explained","tags":[]},{"summary":"Gambaryan\u2019s lawyer, Mark Mordi, criticized the prosecution for failing to file a response to the additional affidavit submitted with his bail application.","date":"2024-04-19","post_content":"A Federal High Court in Abuja, Nigeria has once again postponed the bail application hearing for Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, who remains in custody at the Kuje correctional center. \nOriginally set for April 18, the court has rescheduled the hearing for April 22, according to local news agency Nairametrics.\nDuring the court session, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) told the court that Gambaryan\u2019s lawyer submitted an additional affidavit to his bail application on April 16.\nSenior counsel E.

Zolliker explained that Peaq IDs allow the machines to interact with the blockchain and redistribute the rewards in a \u201Csecure and trustless manner.\u201D\n\u201CThey can also store the usage data, properly anonymized, on-chain \u2014 for maintenance purposes,\u201D he said.\nToken 2049 conference goers getting tokenized coffee and ice cream.

If the answer is yes, it\u2019s most likely a good fit.\u201D\nMore specifically, he said the project is already looking into different sectors of potential use cases. This includes robots for logistics and delivery, agriculture, manufacturing, service and hospitality, construction and even environmental monitoring.\n\u201CPeople don\u2019t need to fear robots coming for their jobs when they can earn from these robots,\u201D he said.\n\u201CWhile there\u2019s no stopping automation, the most equitable way of moving forward with it is to let everyone have a stake in it.\u201D\nMagazine: Bitcoin Halving will pump games, Shrapnel\u2019s \u2018simple\u2019 secret revealed: Web3 Gamer\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.

While there is excitement around the crypto industry\u2019s potential, concerns linger about regulations, cryptocurrency volatility, and the risks of scams and fraud. \nAkangbe clarified that the uncertainties are due to the back and forth between the Nigerian government and stakeholders in the crypto space.

These conditions include that 100 Pi apps must have been developed in addition to the 15 million users passing KYC. In addition, the team must have completed all \u201Ctechnology, product, business and legal\u201D work needed to launch the network, and there must not be an \u201Cunfavorable external environment\u201D that would hinder the network\u2019s success. The team has not yet announced a specific date for mainnet launch.\nAIMultiple analyst Cem Dilmegani claimed that Pi Network will probably not benefit users, stating, \u201C[w]e don\u2019t expect anyone except the founders to benefit from PI Network in a significant way.\u201D That\u2019s because it \u201Cworks like a direct selling or affiliate marketing system, promising future rewards to users for bringing in new users.\u201D Dilmegani claimed that the affiliate marketing system is used to drive traffic to the app, which is, in turn, used to sell advertising for the benefit of the app\u2019s developer. \u201CFounders are already benefitting from the app,\u201D Dilmegani stated, as they \u201Claunched optional video ads at launch to monetize the active user base.\u201D\nDilmegani acknowledged that the Pi team could eventually launch a blockchain mainnet. However, he argued that this was unlikely because it would cause the token to rapidly fall in value as users sold into the market. \u201CThen, the coin would not be valuable enough for people to keep on logging in to click,\u201D which would potentially eliminate the value of the app to advertisers.\nCointelegraph reached out to the Pi team for comment. In response, a representative acknowledged that Pi had taken an \u201Cunconventional and novel\u201D approach to blockchain development, such as providing \u201Can intermediate Enclosed Network period of mainnet\u201D instead of launching an open network immediately. This novel approach was taken to \u201Cenable utilities building on the platform and KYC processing of millions of our community members, to help the community further build a robust network for the benefit of the whole community before we launch the Open Network.\u201D\nThe representative claimed that Pi has accomplished multiple goals since its launch, including the creation of \u201CPi mining mobile app, Pi Browser mobile app as the interface of the Web3 ecosystem, Node application, Testnet and Mainnet blockchains, Wallet, developer platform, a novel KYC solution\u201D and more. The representative argued that not launching an open network right away was worth it, stating, \u201CWe believe anything worthwhile takes time and patience, and such components are essential for a healthy launch of the Open Network.\u201D \nAccording to a March 3, 2021 report from Vietnamese media outlet vnExpress, Pi Network is the 22nd most downloaded iOS app in Vietnam. In May 2021, a Vietnamese news outlet reported that Pi had inadvertently leaked images of users\u2019 identity cards to a hacker. However, a Pi Network spokesperson stated that the app handled KYC through a third-party and did not store this data on its servers, nor was there any evidence of a data leak.\nRelated: Vietnam government warns about crypto trading risks as Pi gains in popularity.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

On traditional social media platforms, such as X, user data is held and accessed through a centralized control method wherein the company itself retains ownership of all data.\nIn TikTok\u2019s case, this ostensibly means that ByteDance \u2014 and, by legal extension, the government of China \u2014 owns all of the platform\u2019s user data, including more than 150 million U.S.-based users.\nBy placing data on the blockchain and implementing specific privacy controls, a social media network can give users control over their data without compromising platform functionality.\nRelated: Worldcoin launches its own \u2018human-centric\u2019 blockchain network\nWhile MeWe\u2019s user base doesn\u2019t quite stack up to TikTok\u2019s, the company\u2019s transition to blockchain shows that it\u2019s possible.\nTo that end, Edell shared six best practices for other companies considering the change in his Rolling Stone article: understanding the technology, starting small, choosing the platform that\u2019s right for your organization, staying up to date with regulatory compliance changes, collaborating with stakeholders, and ensuring employees are educated and trained on blockchain.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Its own dedicated network has been designed to scale alongside the broader Ethereum network as a layer 2 to meet the project\u2019s needs.\nCointelegraph spoke with Tiago Sada, the head of product, engineering and design at Worldcoin, to better understand the project\u2019s intention with its network and how it plans to keep humans in the center.\nRelated: Worldcoin: Trail of Bits audit shows no direct vulnerability for Orb software\nSada said that while technically, World Chain will act similarly to any other L2 and Ethereum, its nuance is that it prioritizes humans over bots, with blockchains often facing congestion due to bot activity. \n\u201CUsually, the way it works is that every account is fighting for block space. Usually, since bots can move faster and they can outbid humans,\u201D he said, \u201Cthe networks get saturated with all the transactions for bots, and humans have whatever is left \u2014 many times, they can\u2019t even get in.\u201D\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nWorld Chain\u2019s solution tries to troubleshoot this by favoring transactions completed by verified World ID holders:\n\u201CIt\u2019s going to be an open and permissionless network like everyone else, but we are going to prioritize transactions for humans so that their transactions definitely get in, and then the remainder of the block space is just like any other blockchain.\u201D\nAdditionally, Sada explained how verified users will receive a free gas allowance, minimizing friction for newcomers. The protocol aims for an equilibrium where bots and power users ultimately cover gas fees for casual users.\nHe explained how the Worldcoin Foundation would provide an \u201Callowance\u201D to verified humans, which would make their couple of monthly transactions gas free.\n\u201CThe idea with that is just to make it a lot easier for people to get started, so that one does not need to go through the pains of unwrapping and understanding all these things.\u201D\nThe network aligns with Ethereum and also collaborates with projects like Optimism and Base. Worldcoin anticipates a full launch in the summer, with a soon-to-be-expected developer preview.\nThis announcement comes on the heels of a series of changes the project has been implementing, including tightening its privacy checks to improve the protection of user data and ensure that its platform is available only to people over 18 while also allowing permanent deletion of the user\u2019s iris code. \nOn March 22, Worldcoin even made its orb software open-source and implemented a new \u201Cpersonal custody\u201D privacy feature.\nThese moves follow scrutiny from world governments over its privacy practices, which have led to some temporary bans on operations in countries such as Portugal, Kenya and Spain.\nResponding to the scrutiny, Sada said it is only the natural process of introducing a new protocol that is \u201Cfortunately\u201D scaling at Worldcoin\u2019s pace.\n\u201CWhen any project starts getting to scale, it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to go in and make sure that everything that the project is saying is actually true.

But for everyone who hits a major payday, there is inventively someone else who loses tons of money by betting too much on the wrong coin.\nIt seems like everyone has a strong opinion on memecoins, whether they think they bring a sense of joy and fun to crypto that is often missing or think they distract from the real-world issues blockchain seeks to solve.\nOn episode 14 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond speak with Andreas Brekken, founder of no-sign-up crypto exchange SideShift.ai, about the positives and negatives associated with the memecoin frenzy, as well as what it all means for crypto as a whole.\nThe benefits of memecoin hype\nBrekken believes that memecoins are overall \u201Ca super easy and friendly way for normal people to get involved in crypto just using your phone\u201D and \u201Ca completely harmless way to use crypto\u201D with one\u2019s friends.\nHe argued that memecoins are a net positive for the crypto ecosystem, as they help people engage with blockchain technology and learn more about how cryptocurrencies work. They also function as a real-world testing ground for the technology:\n\u201CWe\u2019re testing real stuff because the same technology we can use to trade memecoins is literally the same technology we use to trade any other assets on-chain or cross-chain.\u201D\nThe chain-congesting frenzy on Solana, for example, will force the network to improve its speed and reliability, which will ultimately benefit the blockchain in the long term, said Brekken.\nWhen asked what more serious crypto projects can learn from meme tokens, Brekken said he admires the speed at which memecoins are able to build strong communities. He also pointed out that many memecoin developers burn their liquidity provider tokens so that their initial liquidity cannot be removed, demonstrating their commitment to a project \u2014 something other developers might imitate in the future.\nMemecoin gambling\nMost memecoins admittedly have no intrinsic or real-world value. As such, many people approach them as a gambling opportunity, one where there is the hope of making life-changing money. However, a large number of memecoin projects end up being outright scams and rug pulls, meaning that investors face the very real possibility that their funds will go to zero.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nBrekken compared gambling on memecoins to gambling at Vegas or on sports: Some people go to casinos with a small amount of money and have fun with their friends no matter the outcome, while others cash out their life savings, lose it all on black and are left with nothing but regrets.\nHe added, however, that one must zoom out to get the bigger picture rather than being upset at memecoins themselves:\n\u201CMaybe the bigger question is, why are people gambling so much? I think one way to look at this is it may be that people are gambling because they don\u2019t trust the system to give them a fair chance, and they\u2019re looking at the inflation, and your money is becoming worthless all the time, and your salary is not going up. So it could be that it\u2019s just a symptom of a financial system that people don\u2019t trust.\u201D\nTo hear more from Brekken\u2019s conversation with The Agenda \u2014 including his thoughts on token names and free speech, the future of memecoins, and how memecoin seasons influence the broader crypto ecosystem \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

This \u201Cwaste gas\u201D is typically either routed to a facility where it can be converted into something useful such as electricity or burnt off into the atmosphere.\nDue to the remote location of many of Iraq\u2019s oil fields, it\u2019s long been considered economically infeasible to convert the flare gas and, as such, much of it ends up polluting the atmosphere.\nIraq\u2019s Rumaila oil field is the world\u2019s biggest producer of toxic flare gas, though efforts are reportedly underway to capture and repurpose as much as 60% today, with the target of ending all gas flaring in the country by 2027.\nBitcoin Mining\nPeople have used everything from nuclear energy to their own excrement to mine cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin mining firm Giga, a Texas startup, uses the flare gas from local oil fields to power truckloads of portable mining rigs. Per a report from CNBC, the company was earning millions in profits as far back as 2021.\nIn Iraq the challenge comes at a much higher scale. As the world\u2019s largest producer of flare gas pollutants, it would take an exceptional effort to convert 100% of its pollutants into usable electricity.\nHowever, as noted above, Iraq currently has to balance its domestic energy requirements with its foreign debt. While adding power to the grid could certainly help ease the nation\u2019s burdens, converting a portion of that electricity into Bitcoin mining could have an even greater positive impact.\nRelated: Crypto firm 7RCC is quietly advancing its eco-conscious spot Bitcoin ETF\nAnother potential avenue for using the energy provided by captured flare gas is in the area of carbon credits. Theoretically speaking, Iraq could not only reduce its own carbon footprint by capturing flare gas, but it could engage the international market by selling carbon credits via the blockchain. This would provide immutable proof of the nation's efforts and a potential temporary revenue stream as it pursues the reduction of its dependence on fossil fuels.\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

They work like a secret handshake between two parties, proving that one person has signed off on something without revealing their secret code.\nRelated: Unpacking Schnorr Signatures: Blockstream\u2019s MuSig to Improve Bitcoin Transactions?\nThe implementation will allow ICP smart contracts to sign Schnorr signatures to etch Bitcoin Runes, inscribe Ordinals in a decentralized manner, send, receive and bridge BRC-20 tokens directly on the Bitcoin base layer, sign taproot transactions and re-inscribe Ordinals.\nICP anticipates the full implementation of threshold-Schnorr to be launched midway through 2024. ICP integrates the core implementation of threshold-Schnorr-BIP340, which enables smart contracts to derive addresses and authorize native Bitcoin transactions.\n\u201CSchnorr allows extra functionality, like batching transactions. It also allows for new use cases that are developing on Bitcoin. You see people inscribing Ordinals over the last year, it will help do this without any tweaks and from other chains,\u201D Connolly explains.\nThe researcher added that the ability to inscribe Ordinals or etch Runes following the Bitcoin halving generally requires using Schnorr signatures. Connolly said Schnorr signatures are similar to ECDSA signatures that Bitcoin uses to control its ownership, but the former is \u201Csimpler, faster and more secure.\u201D She said:\n\u201CIf you have Schnorr as a native thing, then it allows smart contracts to directly write or etch runes on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is pretty special. I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s doing this at the moment.\u201D\nThe hope is that combining Schnorr signatures with ICP\u2019s protocol-level integration with the Bitcoin network will open possibilities for decentralized applications (DApps) and services that can leverage the liquidity and security of Bitcoin without relying on centralized bridges. \nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex\u2019s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

IBC makes diverse chains compatible by enabling trustless communication and value exchange, especially tokens.\nThe IBC protocol was created and introduced by Cosmos Network in 2019 to address the issue of isolated blockchains, enabling them to safely exchange assets and data and promoting a more accessible and scalable blockchain ecosystem. Furthermore, the Interchain Foundation (ICF) established the Interchain Standards (ICS) to specify the necessary functions for the IBC protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem.\nIBC provides a valuable solution to the common issue of cross-chain messaging. This issue is particularly relevant for exchanges aiming to conduct swaps, application-specific blockchains where assets likely originate on specialized chains and private blockchains seeking connectivity with other chains, whether private or public.\nKey features of the IBC protocol\nThe IBC protocol facilitates secure and trustless communication between interconnected blockchains through dedicated channels and smart contract modules.\nOne significant aspect of the IBC protocol is its facilitation of interoperability among blockchains without requiring direct communication between them. Blockchains can communicate seamlessly by sending information packets through special channels, which employ smart contract modules equipped with a light client to verify the legitimacy of the received state. This enables blockchains, regardless of their protocols or consensus mechanisms, to transfer value or data seamlessly.\nIBC is trustless and permissionless, meaning anyone can act as a relayer. The blockchains involved don\u2019t have to trust the parties transferring the information. This setup is crucial for achieving blockchain sovereignty without isolating blockchains, which is a major goal of the Cosmos ecosystem.\nThrough the integration of smart contract modules with light client verification, IBC ensures that the information exchanged between blockchains is valid without requiring direct communication. This eliminates the need for blind trust between parties and enhances the overall security of the ecosystem. Through the use of cryptographic primitives and consensus mechanisms, such as Tendermint, IBC ensures the security and integrity of cross-chain transactions. \nThe IBC protocol ensures security and validity through cryptographic techniques and consensus algorithms inherent to each participating blockchain. Data privacy and integrity are maintained during transmission.\nHow does the IBC protocol work?\nThe IBC protocol revolutionizes how different blockchains communicate, offering a seamless transfer of data between them. \nThe IBC protocol works in two layers: the TAO layer, which stands for transport, authentication and ordering; and the APP layer, an abbreviation of application. The TAO layer sets up secure connections and verifies data between blockchains, acting like a foundation. On top of that, the APP layer specifies how data is packaged and understood by different blockchains.\nIn the Interchain Standard, the client ensures trustless verification of data, and the relayer facilitates the transfer of information between blockchains. Together, they create a robust framework where the standard sets the basic protocols, the client ensures data integrity, and the relayer manages the actual transfer process, enabling seamless communication between different blockchains.\nAt its core, IBC relies on three key components: hubs and zones, packet transactions and smart contracts. Hubs and zones act as central routers and individual blockchains, respectively. Hubs facilitate the relay of transactions and data between zones, enabling cross-chain communication.\nPacket transactions are units of data transferred between blockchains. These packets contain sender, recipient and transaction data, allowing for efficient communication between zones. Smart contracts play a crucial role in IBC\u2019s operation. Each blockchain involved in communication implements IBC\/TAO modules comprising smart contracts. These modules facilitate the orderly transfer of data packets between blockchains.\nThe process of transferring data via the IBC protocol is straightforward: When a user initiates a cross-chain transaction, the packet travels from the source zone to a hub, which then relays it to the destination zone. After processing the transaction, the destination blockchain takes the same path back to deliver a response. The TAO layer handles the infrastructure and security aspects of transferring the data packets between zones, while the APP layer determines how the data is packaged and understood by the sending and receiving blockchains.\nImplications of the IBC protocol for various stakeholders\nThe IBC protocol can improve the user experience by giving users additional ways to access various applications for trading, developing or other uses.\nThe IBC protocol allows basic users to get access to a wider variety of decentralized apps (DApps) and services on various blockchain platforms. Users may safely and effectively transfer digital assets, including tokens and cryptocurrency, across several blockchains with IBC. \nThe IBC protocol is used by traders to increase trading potential and improve their strategies on different blockchain networks. Traders may easily diversify their portfolios, take advantage of price disparities, and access liquidity pools across platforms by executing cross-chain transactions with IBC. \nThis interoperability eliminates barriers to entry and exit between different blockchain-based assets, promoting market efficiency and liquidity. Additionally, by quickly transitioning to alternate networks through IBC, traders can reduce the risks related to network congestion or outages on certain blockchains.\nBy utilizing the IBC protocol\u2019s capabilities, developers can create innovative DApps and improve the functionality of already existing ones. Developers can also build interoperable solutions that communicate with various blockchain networks and facilitate cross-chain asset transfers, data exchange and smart contract interoperability by including IBC in their applications. \nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs), gaming networks and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are just a few examples of the complex decentralized ecosystems that can be created because of this interoperability. In addition, the IBC protocol speeds up and lowers development costs by offering standardized protocols and toolkits for creating cross-chain communication channels.\nThe future of the IBC protocol\nIBC has the potential to create a more connected, robust and welcoming crypto environment by lowering entry barriers and creating opportunities for collaboration.\nBy enabling seamless communication between diverse blockchains, IBC breaks down silos and opens up a new era of interoperability. This has far-reaching implications: Complex DApps, innovative financial products and thriving ecosystems become possible through the free flow of assets and data across chains. Users can interact with multiple networks without sacrificing security or rewards.\nWithout this interoperability, users often have to choose between simply swapping tokens or directly participating in a blockchain network. The IBC protocol removes this dilemma, allowing users to interact with multiple networks without sacrificing security or potential rewards.\nHowever, realizing IBC\u2019s full potential hinges on overcoming technical challenges and establishing robust governance frameworks. Without standardization, competing interoperability protocols could lead to fragmentation, undermining progress. To create a future where IBC truly underpins an integrated crypto ecosystem, collaboration and standardization among blockchain projects are crucial.","post_cover":null,"author":"by Tobias Vilkenson","title":"Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, explained","url":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/explained\/inter-blockchain-communication-ibc-protocol-explained","tags":[]},{"summary":"Around $1.2 billion worth of crypto in the top five holders\u2019 wallets have been flagged as \u2018inaccessible\u2019 due to lost private keys.","date":"2024-04-16","post_content":"The top five identified crypto whales with publicly known wallet addresses hold around $3.5 billion in crypto, according to a dashboard from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.\nHowever, due to lost passwords and private keys, a large chunk of it is inaccessible. \nOn April 15, the on-chain intelligence platform announced the updated dashboard revealing the holdings of some of the world\u2019s on-chain-verified richest crypto holders and whales, including Tron\u2019s Justin Sun and Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin.\nThe top five crypto holders on its list currently own an aggregate of $3.47 billion in digital assets, according to the data.

X Layer essentially connects to other chains built on Polygon CDK through the AggLayer, which allows for the transition of liquidity between these chains.\nAccording to Polygon CEO Marc Boiron, this creates an interconnected network of liquidity across different blockchain protocols\n\u201CX Layer\u2019s connection to the AggLayer solves the fragmentation of liquidity and users across chains on the AggLayer so they can all grow together. OKX\u2019s 50 million users now have an easy path to onboarding to X Layer and all the other chains connected to the AggLayer.\u201D\nInvestment management firm VanEck estimates that Ethereum layer-2 networks could exceed $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030.

The halving will generate a revenue shock for miners and reduce the amount of new BTC issued in the market.\nIn the latest Cointelegraph video, we delve into the potential impact of this event for both miners and investors.\nMost industry participants do not expect the halving to be a cause for concern for the mining industry but rather view it as an opportunity for miners to become more efficient.\nMiners have had four years to prepare for this event by upgrading their mining rigs and seeking out locations where electricity is cheap.\n\u201CWe'll see a lot of miners start to diversify energy wise\u201D, predicts Will Baxter, SVP at Business Strategy and Development at Braiins, a Bitcoin mining company.\n\u201CThey go to landfills, and they\u2019ll use that trash for mining Bitcoin [...] A lot of miners are going to migrate towards stranded energy,\u201D he continued.\n\u201CI don\u2019t think we will see a very large drop in hash rate after the halving, maybe around 10% or less,\u201D said Jaran Mellerud, co-founder and CEO of Hashlab Mining.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin halving will likely impact the price of Bitcoin as it has in the past.

Venom Blockchain aims to meet this challenge, offering a scalable and secure infrastructure that supports a wide array of applications from Web3 development to the creation of fiat-backed stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nLeading the project is Venom Blockchain CEO Christopher Louis Tsu, a seasoned entrepreneur with a rich history in technology innovation, from Apple Computer to biotechnology. In this interview, Tsu offers insights on Venom\u2019s technological contributions to blockchain\u2019s future and its role in fostering broader adoption across various industries.\nCointelegraph: What is your take on the current state of the crypto and Web3 ecosystem?\nChristopher Louis Tsu: I\u2019ve been involved in the ever-evolving tech industry and Web3 for quite some time now, witnessing a remarkable shift in the attitude toward this sector. Jokes aside, even mainstream media quit calling it a bubble backed by thin air.\nCurrently, we\u2019re on the cusp of an unprecedented era in which technology is poised to weave its way intricately into the fabric of society like never before. The surge in trust, investment and alliances with governmental and corporate entities is painting an exciting new landscape burgeoning with possibilities.\nCT: What kind of new opportunities does the market present for blockchain companies?\nCLT: On-chain data highlights the dominance of USD-based stablecoins in transactions, with Tether\nUSDT\n$1.00\nand USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\nprevailing. You can also notice the explosive growth of stablecoins in an incredibly short period. Equally impactful is asset tokenization. Tracking the evolution of both over the years, I\u2019d say they are like two canaries in a coalmine telling us distributed ledger technology is here to stay and will reach many parts of our lives gradually and then suddenly.\nStablecoins and tokenization are sides of the same coin (no pun intended), highlighting the elimination of unnecessary friction in payment settlements. Certainly, it heralds a new transformative era where financial innovations drive broader social changes.\nCT: What are the key features of the Venom blockchain?\nCLT: When it comes to key features, Venom steps in with Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM), Mesh Network protocol, account abstraction and Dynamical Sharding, which seamlessly integrates interchain communication, enabling horizontal and vertical scaling up to 100,000 transactions per second and beyond, while its Threaded-Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm ensures faster and more secure consensus, with high-speed block finality time and low transaction costs.\nAn example of how the Mesh Network protocol works. Source: Venom Blockchain\nWith an already built-in account abstraction feature, Venom Blockchain provides wider authentication options beyond private key ownership, where every account is a smart contract with its own code, and there is no concept of externally owned accounts.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nCT: Who developed the Venom blockchain? Could you share the team\u2019s experience and goals with the development process?\nCLT: The allure of crypto lies in its open-source nature and software composability, allowing us to enhance what the market already offers in something truly remarkable. Here, the Venom team plays a pivotal role, bringing a wealth of experience to the desk. Spanning the spectrum of collective expertise with a particular focus on management and business development, our current strategic goal is to foster the long-term growth of the blockchain as a lasting product. Notably, our track record speaks volumes, with the flawless launch of the Venom blockchain and the successful operation of multiple Venom ecosystem DApps in the current market.\nCT: What makes Venom different than a standard layer 1 blockchain?\nCLT: Overall, the crypto world, in terms of blockchains, is divided into two parts: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM blockchains. Venom stands out as a TVM blockchain, a non-EVM asynchronous blockchain in which transactions are executed simultaneously, contrasting with synchronous blockchains where transactions occur one by one.\nWith key aspects such as account abstraction, Dynamic Sharding and the Mesh Network protocol, which ensures faster transaction speeds and reliable message delivery, new opportunities emerge for finance and government solutions, such as CBDCs, fiat-backed stablecoins and the tokenization of real-world assets. This includes the possibility of creating new networks with autonomous control over their economics and gas metrics.\nHow Venom Blockchain\u2019s network layer works. Source: Venom Blockchain\nNevertheless, it provides flexible opportunities for Web3 DApps and developers, with our Solidity-like programming language, Threaded-Solidity (T-Sol), easing the onboarding process for new developers on Venom Blockchain.\nCT: Why do you think there\u2019s a need for such infrastructure?\nCLT: Institutions and individuals require a blockchain solution capable of scaling to achieve mass adoption without compromising speed or increasing fees. The Venom blockchain\u2019s infrastructure not only offers business opportunities but also empowers governments to harness blockchain technology without relinquishing control.\nThe applicability of this technology opens even broader potential for developing countries as they can tokenize real-world assets such as minerals, forests and carbon credits. For instance, banking services can leverage blockchain to establish micro-lending protocols for small farmers and promote financial inclusion for the unbanked. Additionally, there are cost reductions associated with cross-border transactions.\nCT: Could you share Venom\u2019s plans regarding partnerships, events and integrations?\nCLT: Firstly, we\u2019re launching a TokenForge Hackathon with a prize pool of $200,000, alongside other ecosystem incentive programs, to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on the Venom blockchain. In addition, we are actively pursuing business-to-government (B2G) deals in Eastern African countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), aiming to establish strategic partnerships that leverage blockchain technologies to address local challenges and drive economic development.\nWe\u2019re exploring opportunities for wholesale banking deals to streamline financial services and promote inclusion, as well as initiating carbon credit-related deals to contribute to environmental sustainability. This reflects our commitment to driving meaningful impact and growth across various sectors through strategic partnerships and integrations.\nCT: Where do you position Venom in the crypto-native world of Web3?\nCLT: With the Venom blockchain bearing the role of an essential medium connecting corporations and Web3, its position will always be in the middle, adopting a two-pronged strategy:\nIn the short term, our focus is on attracting developers to explore the TVM and develop projects on Venom. To catalyze the snowball effect, we\u2019re fostering talents and generating projects that drive increased on-chain activity.\nHowever, our primary strength lies in collaborating with sovereign nations to integrate blockchain technology into various facets of the operation. This extends beyond initiatives like CBDCs or tokenization, we are engaged in substantial governmental projects with broad discussions already underway.\nCT: How do you envision the future of the digital landscape?\nCLT: The rapid growth of the crypto space is surpassing human understanding, potentially leading corporations to dismiss managers who don\u2019t act swiftly on crypto projects. Legal arbitrage is already in motion, with prime locations for crypto development including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands.\nRegulatory hurdles remain the main barrier to progress, prompting countries to compete for talent by offering favorable conditions. As talent relocates, countries will endeavor to attract crypto projects back to their jurisdictions. I see this as the real race will begin approximately two to three years from now.\nLearn more about Venom Blockchain\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#Environment\n#Stablecoin\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

Powered by Phemex, the timeline allows crypto community members to explore and look back at the important events that shaped the industry into what it is today.\nIn the tumultuous landscape of the digital age, where trends come and go at the speed of a click, one phenomenon has risen to prominence like few others: nonfungible tokens (NFTs). The years 2020 and 2021 marked a period of unprecedented growth and widespread adoption of these digital assets, reshaping the way we perceive ownership, art and the internet itself. In fact, in 2021 alone, the NFT market saw approximately $25 billion in trading volume, compared to an almost non-existent metric just a few years prior.\nWhile the concept of blockchain technology had been around for over a decade, the emergence of NFTs captured the imagination of both creators and collectors. NFTs represent unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, ensuring their scarcity and authenticity. This innovation allowed for the tokenization of digital art, music, videos and even tweets, turning intangible creations into valuable commodities.\nThe concept of NFTs can be traced back to at least 2012 when the Colored Coins protocol was created on the Bitcoin blockchain. This protocol allowed users to issue custom tokens representing digital or physical assets. However, it wasn\u2019t until later, with the emergence of Ethereum smart contracts and the ERC-271 token standard in 2017, that nonfungible tokens specifically for digital assets became possible.\nOne of the earliest and most notable examples of NFTs gaining widespread attention in 2017 was CryptoKitties. Developed by Canadian studio Axiom Zen, CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based virtual game that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell virtual cats. Following the success of CryptoKitties, numerous other projects began experimenting with NFTs for various purposes, including digital art, virtual real estate, in-game items and more. Platforms like Decentraland and NBA Top Shot gained traction during this period, showcasing the diverse applications of NFTs beyond gaming.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex\u2019s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions. The event kicked off with a glamorous red carpet walk, followed by opening remarks from the Phemex founder.\nThe evening featured a range of activities, including expert insights from prominent figures, such as Cointelegraph CEO Yana Prikhodchenko, who shared her perspective on the growing trends in crypto media. A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: \u201CPulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.\u201D\n  Read more\nThen, between 2020 and 2021, mainstream adoption exploded.\nNFTs reached new levels of mainstream recognition in 2021 as high-profile sales made headlines, including digital artwork selling for millions of dollars and celebrities launching their own NFT collections. In one such case, on Nov. 2, 2021, award-winning writer and director Quentin Tarantino announced he would auction off seven uncut scenes from Pulp Fiction as NFTs, built on the Secret Network. \nOther sales, too, mesmerized headlines, such as the $69 million sale of Beeple\u2019s digital artwork \u201CEveryday: The First 5,000 Days\u201D at Christie\u2019s auction house in March 2021. Newly created digital artworks by artists like Pak and Grimes fetched millions of dollars in auctions and private sales upon inception. During this time, iconic collections, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, were also born.\nEach being a part of a 10,000 algorithmically generated profile pictures collection, in March 2021, a CryptoPunk NFT (#7804) sold for over $7.5 million at auction, marking one of the highest prices paid for a single CryptoPunk at the time. Following this milestone, in October 2021, a rare triple Bored Ape set, consisting of three apes sold as a bundle, fetched over $24 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction. At the same time, the number of NFT marketplaces expanded rapidly during this period. Platforms such as OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation and Nifty Gateway gained widespread popularity, providing avenues for creators to mint and sell their digital assets. OpenSea emerged as one of the largest NFT marketplaces, with monthly trading volumes surpassing $1 billion by mid-2021, a figure since overtaken by Blur and OKX NFT.\nHowever, this surge in popularity also brought criticism regarding environmental concerns due to the energy-intensive nature of blockchain transactions, as well as questions about the intrinsic value of digital assets. Indeed, during the crypto winter of 2022\u20132023, the trading volume of NFTs fell by a staggering 99% from its 2021 peak. \nLegal disputes also emerged over the ownership and authenticity of digital assets, highlighting the need for clear regulations and guidelines. Some platforms implemented verification mechanisms to authenticate the originality of NFTs and protect creators\u2019 rights, while others grappled with defining ownership in decentralized ecosystems. Indeed, following the widespread publicity of the Pulp Fiction NFTs, Miramax sued the Hollywood director in a copyright lawsuit that was settled in September 2022. Yuga Labs, the current owner of both the BAYC and CryptoPunks series, also faced similar legal battles over its digital collections. \nYet, all was not lost; with the ongoing crypto bull market, NFTs trading volume has recovered. New NFT projects, especially in Hong Kong, are surging in popularity, with collections gobbled up shortly after release. New protocols, such as ParaSpace (now Parallel Finance), are developing new tools for the ever-increasing NFT lending market. Meanwhile, new Ethereum token standards, such as ERC-404, seek to fractionalize NFTs and enable their widespread access. \nOverall, the NFT space continues to evolve, with ongoing experimentation in various industries and new platforms emerging to cater to different niches within the NFT ecosystem. Additionally, efforts to address environmental concerns and improve the sustainability of blockchain technology are underway as developers and enthusiasts seek to ensure the long-term viability of NFTs as a form of digital ownership and expression.\nRelated: The different types of NFTs: A beginner\u2019s guide\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nYour go-to source for staying on top of market trends, and emerging artists, and unlocking opportunities in the NFT landscape.

Users began to realize that building on layer-1 had flaws, so developers began exploring layer-2 (L2) strategies to address the bottlenecks of building on layer 1. Although there were already solutions for Bitcoin DeFi using layer 2, most relied on Wrapped Bitcoin or wrapped tokens in general, which made it possible to use BTC across different blockchains.\nHowever, Wrapped Bitcoin and its derivatives required custodians for reserve management, undermining decentralized structures. The model also introduced counterparty risks and additional attack vectors, such as those seen in smart contract breaches on Poly Network, a cross-chain interoperability protocol.\nWrapped BTC may introduce additional possible attack vectors, counterparty risk and concerns about centralization. Source: AtomiqDeFi\nIn response to Bitcoin DeFi challenges, atomic swaps emerged, removing the need for wrapped tokens. Atomic swaps facilitate direct transactions between blockchains while ensuring simultaneous execution.\nOvercoming Bitcoin DeFi-related risks\nAs a Bitcoin L2 protocol, Mintlayer is developing the technologies to facilitate atomic swaps. Additionally, AtomiqDeFi, the first project incubated by Mintlayer, is developing a suite of decentralized applications (DApps) using Mintlayer\u2019s atomic swap technology. These DApps will include the world\u2019s first Atomic-Swap-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) on Bitcoin. Charlie Shrem, founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, expressed his excitement regarding the project, stating:\n\u201CExploring the frontiers of Bitcoin DeFi, Atomiq DeFi's DEX and its atomic swaps technology is nothing short of revolutionary. It's like we're opening a new chapter in the saga of blockchain evolution. Being one of the early believers in Bitcoin and Mintlayer, I can't help but feel a surge of excitement seeing our path now merging with the groundbreaking efforts of Atomiq DeFi. It's a thrilling time to be part of this journey.\u201D\nAtomiqDeFi is building an ecosystem of tools, including a launchpad, a decentralized exchange (DEX), an end-user-focused wallet and a cross-chain bridge, all powered by the Mintlayer protocol.\nOne of the ecosystem\u2019s products is the Atomiq DEX, which will be implemented in phases and allows users to trade Mintlayer-based tokens and BTC directly from their wallets. The first version of Atomiq DEX will enable same-chain atomic swaps. Later stages will allow the exchange of BTC and stablecoins for Mintlayer\u2019s native token ML and assets that support Mintlayer standards. Lester Lim, founder of X21 Digital, praised Atomiq DeFi\u2019s DEX, saying:\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\n\u201CThe introduction of Atomiq DeFi\u2019s atomic swap-powered DEX marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. It\u2019s a testament to the innovative spirit driving the DeFi space and a clear sign that Bitcoin\u2019s untapped potential is finally being realized.\u201D\nMintlayer offers the Atomiq Pad for initiatives looking to launch projects within the ecosystem. The platform assists projects seeking early-stage liquidity and offers token distribution as a solution to help kickstart their communities. It also aims to be compatible with the Lightning Network, an L2 payment channel for scalable transactions.\nBeyond AtomiqPad, the ecosystem hosts a noncustodial wallet called the Atomiq Wallet, which will support multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. With the wallet app, users gain complete control over their digital assets, including the ability to stake tokens to benefit, participate in governance and access DApps.\nThe Atomiq Bridge marks a strategic expansion for the team, aiming to boost the ecosystem by enabling easy transactions between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains. The project is pursuing partnerships with bridge providers like Layer0 and Wormhole to help speed up integration with the Mintlayer protocol.\nFunded and comprised of Bitcoin industry experts\nAt the helm of Atomiq DeFi is Zaid Ismail, who is transitioning out from his role as the chief operating officer of Mintlayer to the founder and CEO of Atomiq DeFi. Zaid\u2019s journey from AI-driven healthcare innovation in New Zealand to working on enterprise automation platforms laid the foundation for his role in blockchain technology. Under his leadership, Atomiq DeFi became the first project to receive $1.5 million from the Mintlayer Ecosystem Fund, marking a step toward unlocking Bitcoin\u2019s DeFi capabilities.\nAtomiq DeFi secured its lead investor, X21 Digital, during a $3 million seed round that is closing soon. The current seed round includes prominent venture capital firms, such as NXGen, Dutch Crypto Investors (DCI Capital), Spicy Capital, Altcoin Buzz and the AlphaBit fund run by Liam Robertson. Additionally, Atomiq DeFi\u2019s advisory board gains insights from Lester Lim of X21 and Charlie Shrem of the Bitcoin Foundation, who aim to help steer the project to success.\nAs Atomiq DeFi gears up for its next phase, the project is in advanced discussions with tier 1 launchpads \u2014 with announcements on the horizon. The Bitcoin DeFi space is tight, and Atomiq DeFi decided to collaborate in strategic partnerships with projects including SatoshiSync, Portal and OrdinalsBot, further enriching the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nBitcoin-centric DeFi ecosystem fund\nIn addition to powering AtomiqDeFi\u2019s growth, Mintlayer Ecosystem Fund offers an incubator, accelerator and grants programs for Bitcoin-centric DeFi projects. The typical grants range from $50,000 to $200,000, although some larger grants can be given to incubated projects like Atomiq DeFi. Mintlayer founder Enrico Rubboli remarked on their trust in Atomiq DeFi, stating:\n\u201CWe\u2019re incredibly proud to have Atomiq DeFi as the first project incubated by the Mintlayer Ecosystem Fund, and trust that under Zaid Ismail\u2019s guidance, we\u2019re set to revolutionize Bitcoin DeFi, offering true interoperability with Bitcoin through atomic swaps and offering a truly decentralized way to exchange Bitcoin with any kind of asset issued on Mintlayer.\u201D\nThe fund strategically supports projects that bring new and unique offerings to the ecosystem. Guiding newly developing projects through incubation programs and helping to grow and scale proven projects with its accelerator program, Mintlayer aims to empower the Bitcoin DeFi sector.\nCarrying forward Mintlayer\u2019s future vision, AtomiqDeFi argues that while DApp developers mostly prefer Ethereum, it is time for Bitcoin to take the DeFi crown. AtomiqDeFi plans to be listed on various crypto exchanges following the token generation event, and negotiations are ongoing.\nWith support from Mintlayer, AtomiqDeFi is paving a new path for Bitcoin in the DeFi space and also lays the groundwork for a more interconnected and decentralized financial ecosystem. New collaborations may unlock the untapped potential of the Bitcoin blockchain and shape the future of DeFi based on the original cryptocurrency.\nLearn more about Mintlayer and AtomiqDeFi\n#Bitcoin\n#Blockchain\n#DApps\n#DeFi\n#Layer2\nDisclaimer.

But a lot of work still needs to be done on the Solana core protocol,\u201D Federa said.\nNetwork developers have been planning fixes to \u201Cbottleneck\u201D issues in a specific component of its networking stack implementation.\nHowever, the roadmap for implementing upgrades and expected demand on the Solana network \u201Cdid not line up,\u201D said Federa, adding:\n\u201CThe charitable view of this is a failure of success. There\u2019s massive demand for the Solana block space, and there\u2019s a huge demand for the network. It\u2019s processing more transactions than Ethereum\u2019s layer 1 and layer 2s combined.\u201D\nFedera conceded that a less charitable reading of the situation suggests a failure to plan and implement network upgrades. He added that ecosystem developers may have been able to anticipate the sort of demand spikes based on the network\u2019s past usage.\nRelated: Solana devs target April 15 for failed TX fix \u2014 It\u2019s \u2018not a design flaw\u2019\nAs previously reported, Solana developers aimed to implement a fix for an \u201Cimplementation bug\u201D that recently caused the transaction failure rate on Solana to skyrocket. Federa said engineers had \u201Cnot been sleeping much\u201D as they readied patches and tested features before they hit mainnet:\n\u201CIt has been an ecosystem effort to identify the problem, potential solutions, and short-term and long-term improvements to the network.\u201D\nSome protocols should have a beta label\nSolana has copped criticism for network outages over the past two years, with the blockchain going down for short periods of time. However, the layer 1 is not the only protocol that has grappled with downtimes, with Ethereum layer-2s Base, Arbitrum and Starknet having experienced issues in recent months.\nFedera said that emerging blockchain networks are still in a growth phase, drawing comparisons to the early days of Amazon Web Services and the outages it experienced. Nevertheless, the blockchain industry is being closely scrutinized, and Federa said expectations are not unfounded:\n\u201CI think it\u2019s appropriate to be upset about downtimes and outages. The goal is 100% uptime, and that should be the goal for the whole industry. If that comes at the expense of no scale, that\u2019s not necessarily the best trade-off.\u201D\nFedera also highlighted various layer-2 protocols\u2019 downtime and outages as an indicator that the industry is still developing and growing. This is part of the reason why Solana still operates under a beta label.\n\u201CThe beta tag is honest. The network today does not represent the final form of what developers hope it will be in the future, and there might be other networks that probably should also append a \u2018beta\u2019 tag to them,\u201D Federa said.\nSolana released v1.17.31 for general use by mainnet validators on April 15.

During a panel discussion moderated by Cointelegraph\u2019s editor-at-large Kristina Cornèr, Chen said the monitoring restrictions placed on the company would ultimately prove to be a net positive for the industry:\n\u201CIt is a challenge, but it\u2019s a welcome challenge, and we fully embrace it because we know that that would be great for the market.\u201D\nChen on stage at Paris Blockchain Week discussing Binance\u2019s settlement.

In 2018, the Alliance of Independent Authors launched Blockchain for Books, an awareness campaign about the potential of blockchain technology in publishing. It resulted in a guidebook called Authors and Blockchain.\nThe core principle of a blockchain network, that of a shared public ledger, can act as a mechanism allowing authors to regain control over their work and access valuable data.\nNasisi explained that as more of the traditional web is closed behind \u201Cwalled gardens,\u201D blockchain can offer authors an additional pathway to selling their books.\n\u201CThe blockchain [creates] a new digital book publishing and purchasing experience complete with real ownership, rare books in limited editions, and opportunities for book collectors and resellers to participate in external markets.\u201D\nBeyond financial benefits, blockchain offers transparency and empowers authors to protect their work.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex\u2019s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

This is particularly relevant in a world increasingly concerned with AI-generated content.\nAI: Empowering writers, not replacing them\nAccessible AI has become more mainstream over the last year, and it has been integrated into companies\u2019 business operations in almost every industry worldwide. \nHowever, authors have already had their gripes with the technology making alleged illegal use of their work. In July, author Sarah Silverman sued Meta and OpenAI for using copyrighted work to train their AI systems without permission.\nIn September 2023, a similar lawsuit was filed by the Author\u2019s Guild against OpenAI, alleging misuse of copyrighted material in training of its AI models.\nHowever, Nasisi stressed that AI can be used as a tool for authors, not to replace or exploit them or their work. \n\u201CWe never want to have an AI that is writing the story for a writer.\u201D\nHe said that they designed Booksie\u2019s AI bot integration to aid writers who provide feedback on fiction and non-fiction works.\nThe disruptive duo of blockchain and AI\nWhen looking at the combined potential of blockchain and AI, Nasisi said the two will \u201Cfundamentally change\u201D how the publishing industry functions over the next 10 years.\nHe said he envisions a future where \u201Cwriters will combine their creativity with AI and blockchain to create entire worlds in multiple mediums and interact with fans in novel ways.\u201D\nThis future could involve authors leveraging AI assistance to write a book, then utilizing blockchain to create a limited-edition version, a video series, a game based on the story\u2019s world and accompanying merchandise \u2014 all while maintaining ownership and transparency throughout the process.\nThe impact of this technological convergence extends far beyond publishing. Nasisi highlights other industries ripe for disruption.\n\u201CAI is changing how higher education teaches while blockchain will provide the authenticity of learning via credentials.\u201D\nHe likens the two technologies to yin and yang, feeding off each other and creating a new paradigm.\nBooksie and its partner, Chainletter Labs, are actively working toward this vision. Nasisi concluded, \u201CThe publishing industry will never be the same.\u201D\nWith blockchain and AI at the helm, self-publishing is poised to empower authors like never before, creating a future filled with exciting new possibilities for creators and readers alike.\nMagazine: AI didn\u2019t kill the metaverse, it will build it \u2014 Alien Worlds, Bittensor vs Eric Wall: AI Eye\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nYour go-to source for staying on top of market trends, and emerging artists, and unlocking opportunities in the NFT landscape.

Transitioning blockchains from their isolated nature toward a more interoperable framework presents significant hurdles, necessitating solutions that concurrently address privacy, security and scalability.\nExisting blockchains are either fully transparent or fully anonymous, and neither solves the trust problem. The standard transaction output of layer-1 protocols is limited, with the original blockchain processing only seven transactions per second. Moreover, L1s are not designed to be interoperable by themselves.\nDeveloped by a group of well-known scientists with 35 years of research and 15 years of practical implementation experience, Partisia Blockchain is designed to tackle these issues and become a sustainable ecosystem that enhances building opportunities for developers.\nSolving the current challenges in blockchain L1s\nPartisia Blockchain is an interoperable messaging protocol that aims to solve the 3 biggest challenges in the blockchain space via the unique features it offers. The protocol employs a scalable sharding architecture, customizable multiparty computation (MPC) and tokenomics that allow for paying gas with other tokens than its native token.\nCreated by the project\u2019s co-founder Ivan Damgård, who is also the inventor of Merkle-Damgard hash construction used in Bitcoin\nBTC\n$62,997\n, customizable MPC offers an auditable privacy layer on top of which private data are computed. By allowing the processing of data without knowledge, it ensures the reliability and authenticity of the computation while preserving privacy. The zero-knowledge (ZK) variant technology enables a trust system that helps tokens, both transparent and anonymous, to thrive.\nIts sharding architecture provides an opportunity for multiple blockchains to work independently but simultaneously. The messaging layer facilitates state synchronization by carrying transaction information from one blockchain to another. Whenever there is a need for additional output, a new block may easily be created, thus providing true horizontal scalability.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nVarious blockchains within the Partisia ecosystem are rendered interoperable owing to its gas mechanism. Liquid tokens of different blockchains can be used to pay for gas on Partisia, enabling wider interaction opportunities.\nThe integration of liquid tokens allows for the development of a unique staking model. MPC, Partisia Blockchain\u2019s token that has recently been listed on multiple exchanges, functions as a governance and collateralization token within the blockchain. Users that are eager to participate in blockchain governance stake MPC and earn staking rewards in return. Stakers may opt to be rewarded both in the blockchain\u2019s native currency and other liquid tokens that are used for gas payment, such as ETH, MATIC, BNB and prominent stablecoins, including USDC and USDT.\nFurthermore, MPC is also used to provide protection for the ecosystem. On Partisia Blockchain, users may facilitate various transactions ranging from consensus and ZK computation to token bridging by using MPC as collateral.\nEnabling developers to create unique applications in the Web3 space\nThrough these value propositions, Partisia Blockchain empowers the creation of unique applications in the Web3 space that are currently not possible in other chains. The situation is evident in Partisia Blockchain\u2019s current ecosystem map.\nPartisia Blockchain\u2019s ecosystem map. Source: Partisia Blockchain\nFrom unique Web3 applications like privatized DAOs, secret auctions enabling DEXs to be front-run resistant, auditable e-cash, privatized verifiable supply chains, RWA with privacy features and improved DID to traditional institutional applications like privatized healthcare data analysis, whistleblower solutions and unbiased RNG, Partisia Blockchain has the potential to allow developers to create solutions that could transform or disrupt existing market places.\nPartisia Blockchain announced a 100 million MPC token ecosystem grant program with the goal of fostering innovation.

However, the yield is not without risks, as it relies on trading income of complex Ethereum derivatives to pay out promised returns. \nAmid concerns over its high yield, Guy Young, founder of Ethena Labs, told Cointelegraph in an interview on Feb. 22 that comparisons to the failed Terra stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), were just \u201Cknee-jerk reactions\u201D and that the firm\u2019s yields were organic and sustainable.\n\u201CThe biggest piece we\u2019re trying to get across is that Anchor\u2019s yield was just totally made up,\u201D Young said. \u201CIt was just venture capital firms putting money into [USTC yield protocol] Anchor and then paying out a yield, which came from nowhere.\u201D\nMeanwhile, Ethena\u2019s yields, which are publicly verifiable, are derived from a combination of Ethereum consensus layer inflation rewards, execution fees paid to Ether\nETH\n$3,030\nstakers, maximal extractable value fee captures acquired by Ether stakers, and trading income provided by Ethena Labs. Specifically, the firm opens short derivative positions when it receives long-position collateral assets for minting USDe. The spread, or difference in value between the two positions, is then paid out to USDe holders as yield. \nRelated: Frax Finance dives into DeFi liquidity with $250M USDe allocation\nExchange or buy ETH\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

However, the Bitcoin network is not controlled by miners, but by node operators, he stressed, adding:\n\u201CBitcoin was not made for the miners, but for the hodlers.\u201D\nWould it be possible to scrap halving?\nLike any change to Bitcoin, it is theoretically possible to do away with the halving if you have a hard fork.\nHowever, most think it would be \u201Cnext to impossible\u201D to reach the consensus required to make the change, while others, such as argues that the resulting product, by design, won\u2019t be Bitcoin anymore.\n\u201CIt would break one of the key features that every Bitcoiner loves about Bitcoin: it will have less supply inflation than gold, and continue that deflationary trend,\u201D Bitcoin ESG researcher Daniel Batten told Cointelegraph.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex\u2019s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

What will be the case in 10 years and more is another matter and nobody has an answer to that.\u201D\nSome miners may support the idea of eliminating halvings but full nodes may not, and nodes have significant control over the Bitcoin network, according to New Layer Capital\u2019s general partner Nicholas Safford.\n\u201CIf a group of miners wanted to implement such a proposal, they would need to hard fork the Bitcoin network, after which point, the new cryptocurrency would cease to be Bitcoin,\u201D he stated.\nMiners fear the halving, but they don\u2019t hate it\nBitcoin halvings have been historically associated with bullish sentiment as BTC prices surged to new all-time highs after halvings. However, there\u2019s also a fear that the halving would raise the operational costs of mining Bitcoin, hurting profitability.\nOn the halving date, for a miner whose cost of mining 1 BTC was $35,000 per BTC, the cost would suddenly increase overnight to $70,000 per BTC, New Layer Capital\u2019s Safford explained.\nMiner revenue after halvings. Source: Visual Capitalist\n\u201CThis miner is no longer profitable as the market value of 1 BTC \u2014 currently around $65,000 \u2014 is no longer enough to cover the cost to mine 1 BTC,\u201D he said, adding:\nRelated: Bitcoin needs to hold above $80,000 to keep mining profitable post-halving\n\u201CHalving inevitably leads to several unsustainably high-cost miners \u2014 due to high electricity rate, less efficient ASICs, high overheads and so on \u2014 dropping off the network.\u201D\nSo, Bitcoin halvings are probably here to stay\nIndustry executives and advocates are confident that halvings are eventually beneficial and are here to stay.\n\u201CHalvings are the economic catalysts that ensure a smooth curve toward the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap and the need for continuously improving energy efficiency,\u201D Bitfarms\u2019 chief mining officer Ben Gagnon told Cointelegraph.\nThe total global mining activity in USD terms has grown exponentially each halving epoch despite the block reward halving every four years, Gagnon noted.\nCryptocurrency mining market size, 2022 to 2032. Source: Precedence Statistics\nGagnon also pointed out that there are many coins that don\u2019t have halving events and opted for linear growth of coin supply. \u201CThey have not done well against Bitcoin,\u201D the exec stated.\n\u201CThe whole point of the Bitcoin Network is that the code is law, and it will not be changed,\u201D said SunnySide Digital founder and CEO Taras Kulyk.\n\u201CWhat will happen in more than 10 years, really nobody can tell. But I would still not bet on any dramatic changes like changing the 21 million cap or removing halvings altogether,\u201D Csepcsar told Cointelegraph.

With the addition of zkSync, USDC is now supported on 16 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum and others. \nZero-knowledge proofs determine the integrity of a transaction without disclosing the supporting evidence. Meanwhile, rollups bundle transactions off the Ethereum main layer and club them into a single transaction. Together, they form the core of the zkSync technology, which processes transactions at record speed and low cost at layer 2 and sends the finalized proof back to the Ethereum mainnet.

DappOS, an intent execution network, secures $15.3 million in Series A funding led by Polychain to streamline on-chain outcomes.\nAs the blockchain world rapidly expands, the rise of layer-1 (L1) and layer-2 (L2) blockchains marks the beginning of an exciting era. L1 blockchains serve as foundational networks, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, where all transactions are processed directly on the chain. However, with the growth of these networks came congestion and scalability challenges.\nEnter L2 solutions, such as Lightning Network for Bitcoin or optimistic rollups for Ethereum, designed to alleviate scalability issues by processing transactions off the main chain yet ensuring they are still secured by the underlying L1 blockchain.\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s example of Ethereum as a layer-2 centric ecosystem from the 2024 Hong Kong Web3 Carnival\nThe blooming ecosystem of L1s and L2s, each fostering its mini-ecosystem, is set to dramatically lower the barrier to launching new blockchains. The result? There is a potential explosion in the number of networks, with many attracting significant investment. The proliferation promises to fragment the Web3 ecosystem further, making navigation and interoperability a daunting task for users.\nSimultaneously, the advent of innovative decentralized applications (DApps) in realms like social finance and game finance is ushering in users from the conventional Web2 world.

DappOS, an intent execution network, has secured $15.3 million in a Series A funding round, valuing the company at $300 million.\ndappOS raised $15.3 million in a Series A round led by Polychain at a $300 million valuation. Source: dappOS\nPolychain spearheaded the round, which included contributions from a diverse group of investors, including Nomad Capital, IDG, Flow Traders and NGC. The financial injection is earmarked for operational expansion and further development efforts.\nAdditionally, dappOS has gained recognition in the blockchain space, having been selected for the Binance Incubation Program\u2019s Season 5 in December 2022 and receiving seed round investment from Binance Labs and Sequoia China in July 2023.\nThe project operates by creating a two-sided marketplace that addresses supply and demand within the blockchain ecosystem. On one side, service providers stake collateral to offer various execution services. On the other, developers utilize the platform to meet users\u2019 needs by efficiently turning specific intents into on-chain results.\nOMS: Security solution for intent-based tasks\nTo enhance efficiency and cover various use cases, dappOS introduces the optimistic minimum stake (OMS) mechanism, which was developed to improve the network\u2019s security for intent-based tasks.\nDappOS builds an intent-based infrastructure to solve scalability and complexity issues. Source: dappOS\nOMS mandates that each task be associated with a predefined value and potential compensation for failure, allowing for the execution of tasks before their outcomes are verified. If a task fails, the network employs a consensus process to slash the responsible service providers, ensuring users are either satisfied by the task\u2019s completion or compensated accordingly.\nDappOS\u2019 OMS system benefits both service providers, who are required to stake only slightly more than the total value of active intent tasks, and users, who enjoy cost-efficient and rapid task execution. The post-task verification process facilitates a decentralized verification strategy, bolstering the network\u2019s efficiency and security in handling diverse use cases.\nWith over 20 corporate projects, including GMX, BENQI and QuickSwap, under its belt, dappOS has garnered a user community of over 350,000 and executed more than 1.5 million transactions.\nAmid a rapidly expanding blockchain ecosystem and its complexities, dappOS offers a solution for streamlined, user-centric blockchain interactions. Its innovative approach promises to redefine how users and developers navigate the increasingly fragmented landscape of blockchain networks and applications.\nLearn more about dappOS\n#Blockchain\n#Business\n#Security\n#Decentralization\n#Funding\n#Technology\n#Adoption\n#Scalability\nDisclaimer.

These powerful entities can misuse AI to subtly shape public perceptions and behaviors to serve their own ends, whether for profit maximization or political control.\nFar from being a dystopian fantasy, this scenario reflects our current reality, demanding immediate intervention. Data ownership lies at the heart of the issues with AI technology. Big Tech has effectively appropriated the collective knowledge of humanity, training their large language models (LLMs) on free information and then locking it behind $20 monthly subscriptions.\nGoogle's $60 million annual investment for access to Reddit\u2019s treasure trove of user-generated content underscores the disparity between the value created by community contributions and the compensation (or lack thereof) received by those contributors.\nEmpowering communities with small language models\nAgainst this backdrop, Assisterr \u2014 a Cambridge-based data layer for decentralized AI \u2014 positions itself as a force for change by creating an infrastructure that backs decentralized AI data inference and a network of community-owned SLMs, empowering the very people who feed the data ecosystem.\nAssisterr provides a data infrastructure layer for small language models.

This includes crucial details like soil moisture, pH content, and humidity.\u201D\nHe said this information allows farmers to make \u201Cdata-driven decisions\u201D to optimize crop health and yields. Meanwhile, the DePIN system allows consumers to access information about the food they purchase:\n\u201CThis could include details about the farm\u2019s practices, the origin of the food, and how it was grown. It empowers consumers to make informed choices about the food they put on their tables.\u201D\nRelated: Weather forecasting for developing regions: Here\u2019s how Web3 can help\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nCurrently, the state of the global food trade highlights the urgent need for change. Farmers, despite being the backbone of the industry, often receive a disproportionately low share of the value captured in the market.\nScaling for the world\nAccording to Farmsent, it plans to address this by bypassing traditional intermediaries and enabling direct transactions between farmers and consumers and already has over 160,000 farmers onboarded in Indonesia and Colombia.\nThe platform, currently still in beta, is being used to track coffee, avocados and palm sugar between Indonesia, Colombia, the United Arab Emirates \u2014 where it already has a license to operate \u2014 and the United States. Farmsent said it is currently working on securing three additional licenses.\nShusti said that storing large amounts of data from sensors, farms and partners can become expensive on traditional blockchains:\n\u201CAs Farmsent expands its reach to new markets and connects with more farmers and consumers, the volume of data and transactions within the network will inevitably surge.\u201D\nTherefore, he said that Peaq was chosen for its ability to cost-effectively store data and scale at large. The Peaq network has been gaining traction, and it recently secured $15 million in a Series A round led by Generative Ventures and Borderless Capital.\nIn the past, it has worked on DePIN projects alongside major companies such as Bosch and even worked to tokenize 100 Teslas in a decentralized Web3 ride-sharing initiative across Europe.\nData and security \nHandling the transactions and data of farmers and business owners worldwide is not only a big feat for scaling purposes but also in keeping all that information safe and secure. \nAccording to the Farmsent CEO, its DePIN network gathers information from three sources. In one, it is entered by humans and then validated. Information on farm practices, harvest details and initial processing can be manually entered by authorized personnel and validated for accuracy.\nIt can also be collected through Internet of Things (IoT) sensors placed throughout the supply chain (farms, storage facilities, transport) that can continuously monitor conditions like temperature, humidity and freshness.\nLastly, data is procured from third-party partners like logistics companies that provide data relevant to transport and storage conditions.\nTo keep this data secure, Shusti told Cointelegraph that Farmsent leverages Peaq decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enhance data privacy further:\n\u201CDIDs act like unique identifiers on the blockchain that can be linked to data without revealing the actual data itself. \u201D\nHe said that this allows for data verification and controlled access while protecting sensitive information.\nTill Wendler, the co-founder of Peaq, said this use case within the agriculture industry is not just exciting but also one of the \u201Cmost important ones\u201D due to its promise to push back global food insecurity and \u201Cdeliver cheaper and more quality produce to people around the world\u201D \u2014 and in a secure manner. \nMagazine: Memecoins make millionaires, Terraform and Do Kwon liable for fraud, and more: Hodler\u2019s Digest, March 31 \u2013 April 6\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Central to these issues are malicious entities, including bots and bad actors, which erode the foundation of trust and security that Web3 endeavors to build.\nThe low participation problem is particularly pronounced in sectors beyond decentralized finance (DeFi), where projects focused on nonfungible token (NFT) infrastructure strive to carve out a niche. NFT infrastructure initiatives often grapple with lower engagement levels, underscoring a need for mechanisms that entice and reward users in impactful ways.\nBlockchain-agnostic XP systems\nAmid these challenges, experience point (XP) systems emerge as a promising avenue to boost user engagement across the Web3 landscape. However, for such systems to truly harness their potential and draw in a diverse user base, they must break free from the confines of blockchain dependency. By creating XP systems that are blockchain agnostic, projects can appeal to users from any blockchain protocol, widening their reach and impact.\nThe Itheum Protocol is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable data ownership and trade via Data NFTs, which aims to transform data management, ownership and exchange with security and transparency.\nThe Itheum ecosystem introduces a game-style XP system called BiTz, designed to enhance user engagement and differentiate legitimate users from bots or bad actors. Not bound to a single blockchain, the BiTz system integrates with Itheum\u2019s omni-chain features, inviting users across various blockchains to participate and mint their data as Data NFTs.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nItheum hosts a blockchain-agnostic XP system powered by Data NFTs.

Top performers receive benefits like airdropped Data NFTs from past and future data creators, boosts on monthly Itheum Trailblazer quest rewards and future perks such as giveaways and merchandise.\nTo acquire BiTz, users must possess a BiTz-compatible Data NFT in their wallet, enabling them to participate in the \u201CGet \u201D game. Initially, these Data NFTs were distributed to early supporters of the Itheum Protocol through airdrops. However, users who didn\u2019t receive the airdrops can purchase BiTz-compatible Data NFTs on various NFT marketplaces.\nTo engage in the game, which is playable every 6 hours (reduced to 3 hours during the launch window), users are required to \u201Cburn\u201D a meme as an offering to the BiTz Generator God. Whether users win BiTz is determined by chance following the meme sacrifice.\nBeyond playing the Get BiTz game, users will soon be able to earn BiTz points by engaging with the Itheum Protocol. Activities like exploring and marking favorites among Data NFTs and Data Creators via the Data DEX, utilizing Data Uptime Checks or embedding Data Widgets within the Itheum Explorer will earn users extra BiTz points.\nOffering an opportunity to influence BiTz utility and the development of the ecosystem, users are invited to contribute their insights through the suggestion form.\nThrough these initiatives, Cointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum seeks to resolve data ownership and trade challenges in the digital economy and aims to build a secure, inclusive environment for data exchange.

The project aims to enable digital identity verification for Telegram users over the next five years.\nThe project uses HumanCode\u2019s technology to allow users to verify their human identity on the blockchain. The application, available on Google Play and Apple Store, lets users scan their palms on a smartphone.\nAccording to information shared with Cointelegraph, the technology provides privacy protection and is hardware-agnostic, allowing the scanner to be used on various mobile devices.\nTON Foundation growth director Ekin Tuna said that supporting proof-of-personhood protocols like HumanCode is a step toward a practical reputation system with real-life use cases for TON\u2019s ecosystem:\n\u201CA scalable, private, and decentralized identity will help to onboard the first one billion users to the Web3 ecosystem in Telegram.\u201D\nHumanCode founder Tim Zhang told Cointelegraph that the technology securely scans a human palm by extracting the pattern directly onto a user's smartphone device. \n\u201CThis local extraction ensures the pattern is non-reversible, meaning that even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to our server, reconstructing the palm images from the patterns would be impossible,\u201D Zhang explains.\nThe founder added that the system maintains U.S. SOC2 data security and privacy certifications and implements a triple-layer privacy protection mechanism. The first step involves local extraction of the user\u2019s unique palm pattern, preventing personal information from being transferred off the device.\nThe extracted feature is encrypted before being sent to HumanCode servers to secure the data during transmission. The verification process is conducted locally on a user\u2019s device, removing the need to transfer sensitive data to external servers.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nHumanCode incentives will be given to TON Society members who complete a palm scan and prove their personhood. A \u2018soulbound' token is then minted to represent their verified digital identity before users are rewarded for participating.\nCointelegraph also highlighted the reality of increased skepticism for proof-of-personhood technology in conversation with Zhang, given that Worldcoin has received pushback for its iris-scanning technology.\nThe company\u2019s iris-scanning devices and data collection methods have been subject to investigations and regulatory scrutiny in Hong Kong, Spain and France over the past six months. \nA Worldcoin iris-scanning orb on display at ETHGlobal in London in March 2024.

For most people, scanning your palm with a smartphone camera just feels less intrusive than eye-scanning.\u201D\nZhang also said the technology can potentially combat bots and fraudulent accounts on any social media platform by verifying the authenticity of users through unique palm patterns. This allows a platform to effectively distinguish between real users and automated bots.\nIn March, the TON Foundation allocated 30 million Toncoin, worth around $115 million, for various community rewards to drive adoption.\nThe incentives are allocated to four different areas: $38 million worth of TON will go to token mining and user incentives, $22 million for airdrops, $15 million for the League developer ecosystem, and $40 million for liquidity pool boosts.\nThe Telegram Ad Platform, built on the TON blockchain, officially went live in March 2024.

Studies say that NFT sales are mostly driven by a combination of luck, scarcity and optimism, implying room for improvement to make them more resilient to market conditions.\nUnlike other blockchain-based assets, NFTs have their own challenges on top of the common issues troubling the broader Web3 ecosystem. Despite their popularity and the vast range of uses \u2014 from art to gaming to digital identities \u2014 NFTs face significant hurdles impacting user experience and adoption.\nKey NFT challenges\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a primary challenge in the NFT market. As seen in the so-called crypto winter, NFTs are much harder to cash out than cryptocurrencies. This is because each NFT offers unique features or utilities, making it harder to find buyers or sellers during a market downturn.\nPrices become more volatile, and the duration for which assets remain unsold extends. The liquidity issues lock existing users\u2019 capital while deterring potential investors\u2019 participation due to asset fluidity concerns.\nFractionalization\nAny crypto user can buy one-thousandth of Bitcoin\nBTC\n$62,992\n, but the same is not true for a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, which usually has a floor price of far above 10 Ether\nETH\n$3,030\n. The lack of fractionalization in NFTs creates a massive barrier for newcomers, especially smaller investors, preventing them from participating in the market.\nTransaction costs\nThe more advanced features NFTs offer, the more complex their transactions become to process. While newly emerging standards can address inherent issues of NFTs, they still suffer from the high gas fees for which the Ethereum Virtual Machine-based networks are infamous.\nIntegration and Composability\nThe unique nature of NFTs makes them a challenge to integrate and add to a platform, even within the Web3 ecosystem. Most platforms and protocols are simply not equipped to handle the transactions and storage of NFTs, preventing NFT holders from enjoying the most common functions of decentralized finance (DeFi), such as lending, borrowing and yield farming.\nLack of control over NFTs\nThere are new standards, such as ERC-404, that aim to merge ERC-20 and ERC-721 qualities, but their approach doesn\u2019t give enough control to users over the fractionalized NFTs they hold. For example, if the tokenholder has fractional ownership of multiple unique NFT artwork, they can\u2019t pick which artwork they want to let go of while trying to sell it on a decentralized exchange (DEX).\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex\u2019s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

While there are already some experiments on the topic, these efforts still need to figure out how to deal with the ever-rising transaction costs of networks based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nThis is where HybridX emerges with its gas-efficient hybrid token, HX, combining the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. The unique blend introduced by HybridX aims to harness the strengths of both standards to offer efficiency and flexibility in the trading and management of digital assets of the broader Web3 ecosystem.\nFractionalized, low-cost NFTs\nThe hybrid HX token model allows for the fractionalization of NFTs to increase market liquidity, enabling users to buy and sell portions of NFT assets. The fractionalized NFTs can potentially become more accessible and appealing as digital asset investments for a wider demographic.\nOn top of addressing the liquidity and fractionalization issues plaguing the NFT market, the first project on HybridX \u2014 XDragon \u2014 has selected the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) as its infrastructure primarily due to its capabilities that enhance the project\u2019s features. ICP\u2019s on-chain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) allows for the truly random generation of NFT artworks upon conversion from fungible tokens, a contrast to the sequential allocation common in most NFT collections. The on-chain VRF ensures that each NFT acquired is a surprise, enriching the user experience with genuine uniqueness.\nAdditionally, ICP facilitates the on-chain storage of all NFT metadata, a move that eliminates the need for off-chain components and bolsters the security and integrity of the data.\nThe hybrid token model integrates with DeFi and NFT platforms for enhanced composability. NFT holders can leverage their assets through the HX token in various DeFi applications.\nHybridX also offers flexible management of NFT collections. Users can selectively sell or burn assets without being constrained by current standards\u2019 first-in-first-out (FIFO) restrictions. This allows tokenholders to take a strategic approach to their portfolios.\nSeamless switch from fungible token to NFT\nThe innovative approach to NFTs has already established use cases to demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of HX, including the Web3-powered Dragon Eyes dice-rolling game.\nDragon Eyes introduces the XDragon as a switchable NFT to memecoin.

The discussion revolved around bitsCrunch - a decentralized, AI-powered data network for NFTs and other public chain digital assets recognized by PwC and Ernst & Young. Its partners include Mastercard, Unstoppable Domains, DappRadar, and other key players in the industry.\nAMA: Unveiling the Future of NFTs with bitsCrunch CEO Vijay Pravin https:\/\/t.co\/XcthGSwQLs\n\u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 25, 2024\nPravin began the interview by elaborating on bitsCrunch\u2019s mission to democratize access to blockchain data: \u201CBlockchain data is quite tricky and not human readable, which is why there are many tools and protocols in the space. We want to make this data accessible to both companies and individual users.\"\nThe platform is already user-friendly: anyone can access Bitscrunch\u2019s data APIs with a valid internet connection and an API key, which can be generated instantly or within 48 hours. \"The moment you get access, you can start querying data, making API calls, and building your own dashboards,\" Pravin continued. \u201CWe plan to make the whole experience easier, especially for non-techy people, like adding drag-and-drop interfaces.\u201D\nThe company differentiates itself by offering forensic analysis in addition to traditional analytics. This would involve identifying suspicious activity within the broader blockchain ecosystem, going beyond the NFT focus. \nIn addition, Bitscrunch also offers insights into in-game analytics, providing data on player behavior and in-game asset trading. This type of data can be invaluable to gaming companies looking to understand and target their audience.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nbitsCrunch also has an impressive library of historical data. \u201CJust to give you an example, we can provide prices of up to 250,000 tokens on Ethereum since its inception. Or tell you the price of Chainlink on any given day. Very few players can do that,\u201D Pravin pointed out, comparing to established data providers like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.\nWhen discussing their token BCUT, bitsCrunch also doesn\u2019t go for hype and is more interested in building a functional network. \u201CWe believe in slow and steady growth,\u201D the speaker noted. The bitsCrunch network will rely on node operators to distribute the data load, similar to how services like Amazon and Google work. BCUT tokenholders can participate by delegating their tokens to these node operators, which allows them to choose operators who offer the best value to the network.\nThe results have been promising so far. According to Pravin, in just one month, over 4.22 million BCUT tokens have been staked on the Bitscrunch network mainnet. Additionally, 48 leading node operators, including industry heavyweights like 0xFury, Nodes.Guru and Impossible Finance are already contributing to the network. In the near future, staking will be open to the public.\n\u201CWe\u2019re big fans of existing solutions like Graph Protocol and Covalent,\u201D Pravin said about the inspiration for the BCUT token. \u201CSuch data protocols usually follow Delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) algorithms and sets of node operations. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with, we don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel since it has already been tested on the market. Instead, we want to focus on our core competencies \u2013 data analytics, AI, and machine learning,\u201D he added.\nBitscrunch is taking a big step toward DAO status by launching the \u201CContributor\u201D role. This program allows the community to actively participate in the development of the network and earn perks. \u201CWe want the community to come in, contribute, and then be rewarded for their work,\u201D said Pravin. The first opportunity to contribute is through asset labeling, which allows users to identify wallet types and their origins. These labels are then verified internally, and all contributors are rewarded on-chain through a transparent system powered by Chainlink\u2019s oracles.\nThe next step in community engagement is the \u201CIndicator\u201D role. Currently, the Bitscrunch team decides which blockchains to index, which algorithms to use, and which data analytics to share publicly. However, the future vision is for the community to have a say in these decisions.\nThe ultimate goal for bitsCrunch is to be a comprehensive data hub, not just for NFT information, but to be the destination for all things blockchain data. Pravin gave a glimpse of what\u2019s to come, such as the addition of some major blockchains and potential exchange listings. \u201CThe next big integration and transition to a more decentralized operator model is exciting,\u201D he concluded.\nLearn more about bitsCrunch\n#Blockchain\n#DAO\n#Games\n#NFT\nDisclaimer.

These systems ensure the free flow of information even in the face of censorship attempts by spreading control among numerous participants and encrypting conversations.\nSystems that are resistant to censorship are essential for maintaining the right to free speech, providing information access in repressive governments, and encouraging creativity by guarding against arbitrary limitations on expression and communication. In the digital age, they are a potent weapon for advancing democracy, human rights and the free flow of ideas.\nHow censorship affects traditional systems\nIn traditional systems, censorship weakens the fundamentals of established institutions by preventing free speech, maintaining disparities in power and warping the course of history.\nFirstly, it restricts the right to free speech, which is essential to many traditional communities. Ideas stagnate when voices are silenced, impeding advancement both intellectually and culturally. Censorship can impede the transfer of knowledge and values from one generation to the next in traditional systems where oral traditions and storytelling are essential, undermining communal cohesiveness.\nFurthermore, censorship frequently perpetuates the power relationships found in established hierarchies. By dictating what information is acceptable, those in positions of power strengthen their hold on the narrative, resulting in the silence of dissident voices, the stifling of critical thought and the maintenance of long-standing disparities.\nIn addition, censorship has the power to skew historical accounts, reshaping perceptions of the past and collective memory. Governments and other institutions can sway public opinion by restricting access to information, hiding uncomfortable facts and promoting a distorted version of events.\nFor instance, a kind of censorship occurred in the 2008 financial crisis when risk experts\u2019 warnings about the dangers associated with subprime mortgage-backed securities were played down or disregarded within financial institutions. This lack of transparency about the actual risks partly caused the bubble in the housing market and its subsequent collapse.\nAnti-censorship features in blockchain\nSeveral anti-censorship capabilities provided by blockchain technology are crucial for maintaining freedom of speech and the transmission of information. \nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that blockchains have limits, even though they have robust anti-censorship capabilities. Governments or other influential organizations may attempt to impose restrictions on network access or even establish more tightly controlled, permissioned blockchains. However, the fundamental structure of blockchains makes them an effective instrument for encouraging free expression and transparent information sharing. \nAnti-censorship features in blockchain include:\nDecentralization\nBlockchains rely on a dispersed network of computers, or nodes, as opposed to conventional systems that have central authorities. This implies that no single party has complete control over the network, which makes it challenging to remove or filter content.\nImmutable ledger\nData entered on the blockchain cannot be removed or changed later. Every link in the chain has a cryptographic hash of the one before it, which prevents manipulation and ensures data integrity. Information censors find it very difficult to influence due to this immutability property.\nTransparency\nAll data and transactions on public blockchains are accessible to all network users. Because of this transparency, attempts at censorship are discouraged because it makes data manipulation obvious.\nEncryption\nStrong cryptographic techniques are frequently used by blockchains to protect communications and transactions. Because of this encryption, data privacy and integrity are ensured, making it more difficult for censors to intercept or alter data without permission.\nThe role of consensus mechanisms in censorship resistance\nConsensus mechanisms are essential for decentralized systems like blockchain networks to be censorship-resistant.\nWithout depending on a central authority, these systems allow participants to mutually agree on the veracity of transactions or information. Consensus techniques make it extremely difficult for a single party to filter or modify data by requiring broad agreement across network nodes.\nFor instance, in proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms, to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain, miners compete to solve challenging cryptography puzzles. Because of the decentralized validation process, censorship is not feasible from an economic or logistical standpoint, as no single entity can control the network.\nSimilarly, distributed decision-making processes are the foundation of proof-of-stake (PoS) and other consensus methods to achieve censorship resistance. Consensus techniques preserve the ideals of decentralization and censorship resistance by allocating power among network users and rewarding integrity, which promotes trust and security in decentralized systems.\nHow Bitcoin achieves censorship resistance\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized consensus mechanism, pseudonymity and decentralized governance allow it to withstand censorship attempts by any centralized authority and maintain the immutability of its transactions.\nIn the Bitcoin network, miners compete to add transactions to the blockchain and validate them by solving difficult mathematical puzzles. Because the network cannot be controlled by a single party, censorship becomes a challenging endeavor. Any attempt to filter a transaction would have to overwhelm the network\u2019s total processing capacity, which gets more and more difficult as the network grows bigger.\nAn additional degree of censorship resistance is added by Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous nature. Because transactions are broadcast to the whole network and documented on a public ledger, everyone can take part without needing authorization. Any centralized authority would find it difficult to selectively ban transactions based on the sender or content because of this transparency.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s resistance to censorship is strengthened by its decentralized governance architecture, in which decisions are made by consensus among network users. Modifications to the protocol necessitate wide consensus among participants, making it impervious to censorship efforts by any one person or organization.\nChallenges and future of censorship resistance in blockchain technology\nAlthough blockchain technology is inherently immune to censorship, there are still a number of obstacles that need to be overcome to maintain its effectiveness in the face of evolving threats. \nThe possible centralization of mining power is a major obstacle that threatens the decentralized nature of blockchain if mining gets concentrated in the hands of a small number of strong entities. Nonetheless, the open nature of most PoW systems means anyone can theoretically join the mining process. This creates competition among miners, making it less likely for a single entity to dominate.\nMoreover, censorship resistance faces challenges from legal frameworks and regulatory constraints. Governments may try to control or restrict the use of blockchain technology, which could hinder its capacity to successfully withstand censorship. Adherence to those restrictions may jeopardize the autonomy and decentralization of blockchain networks.\nThe anonymity and privacy provided by blockchain may be threatened by developments in analysis and monitoring technologies. Maintaining anonymity on public blockchains gets harder as monitoring capabilities advance, putting users at risk of censorship and retaliation.\nThe future of censorship-resistant blockchains hinges on privacy-enhancing innovations. Technologies like stealth addresses and zero-knowledge proofs offer robust anonymity and resilience against censorship attempts. However, to fully address these obstacles and ensure blockchain\u2019s enduring resistance, continuous research and development are paramount.","post_cover":null,"author":"by Jagjit Singh","title":"What is censorship resistance in blockchain technology?","url":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/explained\/what-is-censorship-resistance-in-blockchain-technology","tags":[]},{"summary":"The Bank of England and the U.K.\u2019s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, aim for the inaugural group of applicants to join the Digital Securities Sandbox by autumn 2024.","date":"2024-04-04","post_content":"The Bank of England (BoE) and the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have started a consultation on the draft guidance for their Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), which is designed to allow participants to test distributed ledger technology (DLT) for trading and settlement of digital securities such as shares and bonds.\nAccording to a joint consultation and draft guidance released on Wednesday, April 3, the sandbox will last five years and could lead to a new regulatory regime for securities settlement.\nSuccessful applicants using the sandbox will be able to provide securities depository and settlement services, as well as operate a trading venue under modified regulations.\nThe BoE and the FCA aim for the inaugural group of applicants to join the DSS by autumn 2024.
