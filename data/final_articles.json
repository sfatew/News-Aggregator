In the near future, it may be possible to split a dinner and pay using shares of tokenized funds, a blend made possible by tokenizing assets.\nRob Durscki, senior director of tokenization at the Stellar Development Foundation, shared the prediction during the TokenizeThis 2024 event in Miami on May 9. According to him, the bridge between payments and investments will unlock new utilities across financial products. Durscki noted:\n“What we’re seeing now with partners like Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and others issuing this new round of assets on-chain is that they want to unlock yield, [...] but they also want to make it almost seamless to use as a payment tool as well.”\nTokenization is the process of converting rights or ownership of an asset, like real estate or stocks, into a digital token on a blockchain. This enables a digital representation of the asset, allowing for fractional ownership, increasing liquidity and making some financial products more accessible to small investors.\n“Nothing prevents us here from splitting the check on the dinner, and I’ll pay with Franklin Temple funds because I can send you $20 in 3.6 seconds on Stellar.

Here’s how decentralization can help.","title":"The future of online communication: Secure and censorship-resistant chat on blockchain","detailed_content":"Communication remains a basic necessity no matter how much humanity moves forward. The digital era has brought a myriad of online tools that bring people together, and it was a rather swift transition from postcards to Discord groups.\nInstant messaging applications with social elements, such as Slack, Discord or WhatsApp, operate as communication enablers for hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Both individuals and businesses utilize the rich features and ease of use found in such applications.\nHowever, as the power of communication becomes more concentrated under the hands of a few centralized services, a certain set of concerns arise:\nPrivacy and data security: Centralized platforms store user data on servers controlled by a single entity, making them attractive targets for hackers and raising concerns about how these companies use the data for advertising or other purposes.\nCensorship: Centralized entities can censor or moderate content according to their policies or external pressures, leading to arbitrary removal of content or entire communities.\nService outages: Centralization means that every user is affected if the service’s servers go down. This creates a single point of failure.\nMonetization and advertisements: Centralized platforms may prioritize profit over user experience, leading to invasive advertising or selling user data to third parties.\nHow decentralization can improve digital communication\nDecentralized networks offer solutions to the biggest pain points of the Web2-era communication. Blockchain-based decentralization can potentially enhance privacy and security by distributing data across numerous points on the network, making it harder for unauthorized parties to access or compromise user information.\nWithout a centralized entity controlling the communication network, censorship and outage risks can be minimized. Thanks to the user-centric nature of Web3, it’s also easier to enable new monetization models that empower participants.\nThe concept of a decentralized application (DApp) for instant messaging grew quickly over the years, giving birth to several examples. However, providing on-chain communication with Web2-like features is easier said than done. Most DApps that attempt to offer Web2-like features encounter significant hurdles.\nWhile decentralization enhances privacy and reduces censorship, it often comes at the cost of performance and user experience. For instance, achieving real-time communication — which is critical for user satisfaction in messaging apps — is more complex on a decentralized network due to increased latency and inconsistent data synchronization across nodes.\nFurthermore, most DApps compromise by handling user-facing, front-end features off-chain to maintain performance. This approach dilutes the principles of decentralization and limits the functionality and scalability of these applications. As a result, while DApps represent a promising frontier in digital communication, their current implementations are often incomplete and do not fully harness the advantages of blockchain technology.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nFully on-chain communication at scale\nOpenChat, a crypto messaging platform, aims to herald a new era in digital communication, leveraging the power of blockchain technology to deliver a unique, decentralized chatting experience. The platform promises enhanced security and autonomy for users, positioning them prominently in the development of Web3 and making it a relevant choice for those interested in the future of online interaction. OpenChat is running digital communication end-to-end — including front-end — on the Internet Computer (ICP).\nOpenChat is made possible by ICP, a blockchain network designed to expand the functionalities of the internet, offering a platform for smart contracts and DApps to run at web speed directly on the blockchain. ICP’s unique infrastructure aims to unlock the full potential of DApps, helping them perform at traditional Web2 speeds while keeping the whole process on the blockchain.\nOpenChat provides Discord-like servers in a decentralized environment. Source: OpenChat\nRunning on ICP makes it possible for OpenChat to offer the same performance and feature set as Discord or Slack while providing full benefits of decentralization, including data security, reliability and censorship resistance. On top of traditional chat features, OpenChat is also equipped with crypto-native functionality, allowing users to send and receive tokens as chat messages and swap tokens either through integrations with exchanges or in a peer-to-peer fashion.\nThe communication DApp has recently introduced video and voice chat support, with the initial launch including one-to-one video calls in direct chats and group video calls of up to twenty people in private chats. OpenChat’s phase two will target community broadcasts.\nWeb3 chat app governed by its users\nThe idea of decentralization and end-to-end on-chain communication offered by OpenChat has received a warm welcome from the ICP ecosystem. The project raised over 1 million ICP (worth $5.5 million at the time of fundraising) in five hours in March 2023 to become a fully functional decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) led by its community of shareholders.\nAs part of the ICP ecosystem, OpenChat is now controlled by a DAO and uses CHAT as its governance token. CHAT tokenholders will be able to govern the platform and make their voices heard regarding the future of OpenChat, Matt Grogan, co-founder of OpenChat, said at the time.\nOpenChat also offers a video chat feature. Source: OpenChat\nIn August, after the successful transition into a DAO, OpenChat enabled users to create Communities — servers with a Discord-meets-Slack style that enables group admins to create subgroups for more focused conversations. Users can find communities based on common interests or create their own. OpenChat co-founder Julian Jelfs shared plans to enable the OpenChat Communities feature for projects to integrate as a communication tool on their own websites.\nThe roadmap for decentralized communication\nOne of the primary goals of the DApp is to introduce end-to-end encryption for chats in 2024 to offer superior security and privacy. The roadmap of OpenChat also includes a sophisticated tokenization system to reward users for posting key content with CHAT tokens. The development team is fully pledged to keep pace with major Web2 competitors and lead innovation in Web3, meaning the feature set of OpenChat will evolve and expand as digital communication advances.\nOpenChat will be featured in the upcoming global ICPCC event on May 10, which will showcase how ICP technology can enhance decentralized applications on any blockchain.\nFully decentralized platforms like OpenChat aim to address the privacy, security and centralization challenges by offering enhanced privacy, reduced censorship and a user-governed ecosystem. It promises to safeguard user data and empower users through community-led governance and innovative monetization strategies planned for the future.\nLearn more about OpenChat\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#DAO\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

According to Stark, developers have made significant headway toward this goal, culminating in the testing of transactions on Lightning:\n“We released an early part of the code in October and recently demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset. The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.”\nStark added that traditionally, these digital assets have operated on other blockchains that have suffered from high fees and other issues. She argues that Bitcoin’s network is perhaps best placed to facilitate the use of stablecoins because it “is the most secure and decentralized” blockchain.\nBitcoin and stablecoins value as a store of value\nStark went on to discuss the merits of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins as a store of value, especially in nations grappling with inflation issues and devaluing fiat currencies.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nThe Lightning Labs CEO said stablecoin adoption has grown dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic, with users largely being based in emerging markets.\n“The stickiest users have been those looking for a stable store of value. In some cases, they’re using Bitcoin. In other cases, they’re using stablecoins, and in some cases, it’s a combination of both,” Stark explained.\nRelated: What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and how does it work?\nThe two largest stablecoin players — Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) — hold more United States Treasury bonds combined than major nations like Germany and South Korea. Stark said this is an intriguing fact, given that end-users don’t benefit from the interest of holding stablecoins.\nFor those in countries grappling with hyperinflation or precarious economic environments, the choice of holding a stablecoin is driven by the need for a store of value.\nLightning-powered stablecoins will be superior\nGiven the significant growth in value of the stablecoin market, Stark said there is a need for the infrastructure to enable the issuance of stablecoins and real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n“That’s why we’re building this protocol, this technology right now. We’re not issuing assets, we’re building the rails. Asset issuers will use our technology to issue real-world tokenized assets,” Stark explained.\nRelated: Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions\nThe CEO added that financial institutions could issue gold assets, stablecoins and other fiat-backed assets on Bitcoin and then transact over the Lightning Network.\nPerhaps most telling was the relative cost compared to other blockchains and conventional traditional finance systems, which Stark highlighted:\n“If you look at Visa where fees in the U.S. can be upward of 3%, or even 1%, the fees, transacting with stablecoins on Lightning can be dramatically lower, a cent or less than that.”\nStark added that this could competitively enable people to transact globally at far lower rates than through traditional networks.\nMagazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

Internet Computer Protocol’s (ICP) SNS framework allows for creating fully decentralized DAOs that give power back to the community.\nFrom event to DAO\nCentered around the ICP ecosystem, the ICP Community Conference (ICPCC) is a multichain event brand. It aims to host annual conferences to help the wider Web3 industry understand the basics of ICP and showcase its potential in integrating with and offering value to other popular chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\nSlated for May 10, ICPCC 2024 will be a global livestream accompanied by meetup watch parties organized in more than 25 cities worldwide. Content creators, live MCs, and innovators will present everything ICP has to offer the Web3 ecosystem.\nThe livestream is programmed in a way that spans prime times of all three fundamental time zones.

A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nThis experimental event comes with the goal of taking decentralization to the next level. The whole event series will be launching into a DAO that will oversee the ICPCC brand from then on.\nLeadership as a service\nWithout a core or central team, the new DAO will be governed by elected council members. Collectively called the ICPCC Council, they are essentially paid vendors who are in charge of writing some of the more complex proposals that would be necessary for helping the DAO stay on track with its primary goals. This “leadership-as-a-service” does not delegate council members any authority to act on behalf of the DAO. Instead, they are limited to simply preparing high-quality proposals, while other DAO members can elect and remove council members directly.\nAs an SNS DAO, the new organization leverages unique features that strengthen decentralization and streamline participation. All components of decentralized apps (DApps) — including front end, back end and data — are on blockchain and, therefore, the DAO can exercise full control over every aspect of a DApp via voting. Moreover, front-end interactions do not require any gas fees, effectively removing a significant barrier to blockchain-based development.\nThere will be no multisig or custodians for the treasury wallet, leaving it completely under the control of the organization that will manage it in a gasless affordable environment.\nBe part of the biggest user onboarding wave since ICP Genesis.\n\nJust dropped: Our first official presentation of #ICPCC24!🔥\n\nExpect talks, demos, airdrops, giveaways, meetups \u0026 more!\n\nMay 10 awaits.

Hence, the DAO is registered as Marshall Islands DAO LLC, which empowers it as a legal entity that can legally sign contracts and manage IP exclusively through on-chain proposals. The annual registration fee will be paid directly in USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\n, a milestone for crypto adoption.\nAttendees to become owners\nDebuted last year, the ICPCC is already transforming into a major event series. It is currently organized by Code \u0026 State, an ICP-focused venture studio, which has already delegated all rights related to ICPP. The decentralized organization will then vote to elect council members who will submit proposals.\nRegarding the takeover, Isaac Valadez, the venture lead at Code \u0026 State, commented:\n“This won’t be our DAO. The ICP community really is taking over total control. This is a major Web3 event series converting into a protocol that needs no custodians or centralized dependencies, and it’s an experiment that could outlast all of us.”\nApart from hosting a live DAO launch, the event will also provide chances to win airdrops of a wide range of tokens and NFTs. Party-goers and livestream listeners who enter airdrop codes will be whitelisted for future airdrop allocations. Starting from 2025, ICPCC DAO LLC will also host an annual in-person conference.\nLearn more about the ICPCC\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Adoption\n#DAO\n#Internet Computer\nDisclaimer.

However, the path for ICP was anything but smooth.\nInitially, the ICP token faced a harsh reception with a massive price drop resulting from a series of challenges, including alleged market manipulations, poorly structured token unlock schedules and various operational setbacks. Despite these tumultuous beginnings, ICP’s underlying technology remained robust — a fact largely unrecognized in the broader Web3 community.\nFrom obscurity to prominence\nThe narrative began to shift dramatically for ICP from October 2023 through January 2024. The ICP token surged by an impressive 490%, climbing from $2.93 to $14.37 and marking one of the first significant rallies of the emerging bull market.\nThe ICP token enjoyed a major pump during the last quarter of 2023. Source: TradingView\nThis resurgence recaptured the market’s attention and spotlighted ICP’s recent advancements, particularly its pioneering capability to host fully functional decentralized applications and artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nAmid this revival, the ICP community has rapidly expanded, catalyzing the formation of a new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will steer a major Web3 conference series, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of its untapped potential.\nMajor ICP event to become a DAO\nICPCC, the ICP ecosystem conference series, is the largest attempt at demonstrating the progress made by the Internet Computer Protocol in terms of blockchain and Web3 usability. Scheduled for May 10, the event consists of a free nine-hour global livestream accompanied by a number of community-organized watch parties in 25 major cities worldwide.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nDuring the ICPCC livestream, the ICP-focused event series will become a fully DAO through a decentralization swap sale. The newly formed entity, ICPCC DAO LLC, will then operate as a community-owned, self-sustaining, decentralized conference event series with an aim to celebrate The Internet Computer Protocol and broadcast how the ICP connects and empowers the broader Web3 space.\nA closer look at the FTX scandal\nIn a move to showcase a thriving blockchain ecosystem, the ICPCC24 will offer several key highlights from the community.\nThe first one is ‘Cracking FTX,’ a documentary that seeks to unveil a new “dark side” of FTX, focusing on the alleged market manipulation during the ICP token launch. Created by YouTube content creator Kyle Figs, the documentary will premiere during the ICPCC livestream on May 10, taking viewers on a global investigative journey.\nThe main premise of the film is the revealing of how the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX allegedly used synthetic assets to sabotage major Web3 projects, including the Internet Computer Protocol and Ronin Network.\nAside from an investigative backdrop — from Los Angeles, United States to Zurich, Switzerland — the film also features interviews with prominent figures from the broader blockchain and crypto community, including Ben Armstrong (a.k.a. Bitboy Crypto), Bitcoin Renegade, Crypto WendyO and Jordan Mack.\nCommunity-driven blockchain projects\nAs a gold sponsor of the ICPCC, the CLOWN community will also have a chance to onboard new “ICP Clowns” — a Web3 community that promotes ICP-powered projects without permission or provocation.\nFostering a new gathering around a token that was abandoned by its creators following a rug pull attempt, a stockbroker from New York led the revival of the CLOWN token’s community until it took on a life of its own. The CLOWN community is now building a thriving team of self-declared “clowns” to fuel various initiatives, including creating flashy memes promoting different ICP projects.\nWindoge98 offers a functional operating system with games. Source: Windoge98\nAnother fun project joining the event is Windoge98, a retro-meets-meme type of project that brings the look and feel of Microsoft Windows 98 on blockchain with a “Doge” sauce. Aiming to bring people to the Internet Computer in a similar way that Dogecoin\nDOGE\n$0.15\nhelped people into Bitcoin, Windoge98 has a functional operating system with an array of playable games —such as 3D Pinball — as DApps hosted on the Internet Computer.\nWeb3 grows on robust infrastructure\nFollowing a rocky start with the price charts, the ICP blockchain has found its footing thanks to the Dfinity Foundation’s delivery of the promises on the tech and infrastructure side. From integration with key blockchain protocols to launching a Web3 accelerator platform, the ICP ecosystem continued to build with over 300 developers regardless of the market condition, earning the ICP community a place in the top 5 development activity charts.\nOrganizing its own “Community Conference” is a way for the ICP ecosystem to show what’s been cooking in the kitchen to a much bigger audience. “This won’t be our DAO, the ICP community really is taking over total control,” said Code \u0026 State venture lead Isaac Valadez, adding:\n“This is a major Web3 event series converting into a protocol that needs no custodians or centralized dependencies, it’s an experiment that could outlast all of us.”\nAttendees of the ICPCC24 will have the opportunity to see the growth of the ICP community, along with the potential ICP holds in bringing emerging technologies like AI to Web3 with a seamless experience.\nLearn more about the ICPCC24\n#Blockchain\n#Event\n#Community\n#AI\n#Internet Computer\nDisclaimer.

The BNR is considering a national digital currency that incorporates the latest innovations in the technology and is highly tailored to local conditions.\nA retail CBDC would advance Rwanda’s cashless economy national initiative and increase the resilience of the financial system, which is still subject to frequent power outages, the BNR found. The central bank expects to spend $35 million on printing and maintaining its cash supply in the next five years despite its cashless goal.\nThe BNR is proposing an interest-free, intermediated CBDC with interoperability with all the country’s existing payment systems and potentially other CBDCs after the appropriate amendments to the country’s Central Bank Act are made. It recommended a token-based, rather than account-based, model with open programmability and smart contracts.\nTokenization would allow digital cash to be transferred offline using Bluetooth or near-field communication (NFC) technology and would not require a smartphone. This is in contrast to current electronic payment options.\nProgrammability would be a mixed blessing, the study noted:\n“The advantages of open programmability, which facilitates value-added innovative products and services, are expected to outweigh the arguments of privacy and security.”\nThe BNR foresaw no more than “partial pseudo-anonymity” for the CBDC.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nRelated: BIS issues comprehensive paper on offline CBDC payments\nPayment service providers currently make up less than 0.9% of the Rwandan financial sector. The sector is challenged by low financial literacy, high remittance costs and a large informal economy, among other things. The BNR noted that reducing the amount of cash in circulation could formalize more of the economy.\nThe study recommended the imposition of user fees and holding limits without sorting out details. Public acceptance of a CBDC was also left an open question.\nSource: Central Bank of Rwanda\nThe BNR favored a distributed database model over a distributed ledger for increased reliability. Its analysis used the World Economic Forum’s CBDC Policy-Maker Toolkit.\nTokenized wholesale CBDC projects have been undertaken by Mastercard and Ripple, as well as the European Central Bank and the Bank for International Settlements’ new Project Agora. Tokenization in a retail CBDC may be an innovation. Offline CBDC transfers is also a subject of current research.

Dubbed “.WITG,” the digital identity domain, assignable to each participant, will allow users to network as well as access education and training at the intersection of technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. \n“The .WITG TLD is designed to foster a strong sense of community and identity among women in tech, facilitating networking, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities,” wrote the organizers of the Women in Tech Global Summit. By “using the tech to learn the tech,” this pioneering domain aims to provide women with the tools they need to succeed and excel in the digital space, they added. \nThe Women in Tech Global Summit 2024 Main Event\nIn a recent survey by crypto exchange KuCoin, 88% of young adults in a worldwide sample of 1,900 respondents said that they are “eager” to pursue careers in the blockchain space, with 75% demonstrating a “very high” interest in the Web3 sector.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nThat said, only 15% of respondents surveyed said they possess more than three years of experience in blockchain. The exchange has since launched the KuCoin Campus initiative, which offers a series of offline events at schools and colleges around the world to teach students about digital finance. \nSimilarly, crypto exchange Bitget recorded over 6,000 participants on the one-year anniversary of its $10 million Blockchain4Youth initiative from last May. Over 51 universities participated — such as University College London, National Technological University of Argentina, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, National Taiwan University’s Blockchain Club, Philippines Ateneo De Manila University, and others — issuing more than 2,000 Web3 certificates for participants who completed the courses and passed the final exams. \n“Blockchain4Youth’s future plans include providing more scholarships worldwide and launching more online courses and content featuring different influencers in the field on crypto-related topics to further garner youngster’s attention,” exchange staff wrote. The initiative is ongoing and will last until May 2028. \nEven Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, is turning his attention to education after stepping down from office in November 2023. “We wanted the @GiggleAcademy logo to show youth, fun, positive energy, and growth, we also want to show respect to our Binance heritage,” wrote CZ in a tweet promoting his newest educational initiative.\n“Initially, our dev capacity may lag behind a bit, but we intend to catch up once we get to the scaling phase,” he wrote in a separate post in reference to Giggle Academy. \nCointelegraph previously reported in November 2023 that the Institute of Crypto-Assets, a first-of-a-kind scientific board, opened at the Léonard de Vinci Centre in the business district just outside of Paris.

Proof-of-Inference allows miners to provide predictions along with ZK proofs to ensure computational integrity, confirming their predictions were run on a specific model directly on the blockchain.\nBy rewarding miners who deliver the most accurate predictions and verifiable models, the subnet ensures optimal performance for its use cases. Inference Labs aims to enhance the Bittensor economic system by introducing a market-driven approach to incentivize miners based on their performance and the volume of on-chain verifiable transactions.\nMerging allocation strategies and AI\nAdditionally, Inference Labs introduced Omron.ai to address the complex challenge of optimizing staked allocations across Actively Validated Services (AVS) through the application of artificial intelligence (AI).\nOmron offers a practical solution to selecting the most advantageous AVS among potentially tens of thousands of options by considering a variety of risk factors, including changes in AVS rewards as more operators enter the market and their effects on risk-adjusted yields. As Omron begins to receive payments and slashing data, the subnet will be well-positioned to integrate this real-time data, ensuring that these models provide a more accurate depiction of yield.\nOmron allows users to stake their digital assets like Ether\nETH\n$3,032\nand earn rewards through their choice of Liquid Restaking (LRT) protocol. For example, Renzo converts staked ETH or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) into a new type of tradable token that continues to earn rewards. These tokens are also used within the Ethereum network to gain additional financial returns and provide vital data for AI training on the Bittensor network.\nOmron operates through a complex system of smart contracts, Bittensor validators and mining nodes, which are computers that process the computationally intensive requirements of Inference and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. The Bittensor economic model incentivized the creation of Subnet 2, a powerful zero-knowledge machine learning (ZK-ML) compute cluster.\nThe Bittensor decentralized network allows machine learning models to exchange and monetize on a blockchain platform. On the Bittensor, nodes that host these models serve requests for AI services and earn crypto in return for their computational contributions.\nInference Labs’ strategic integration of AI and blockchain through the innovative Proof-of-Inference mechanism and the successful pre-seed funding round marks a forward-thinking step toward democratizing AI technology and ensuring its development is equitable, accessible and protected from monopolistic tendencies with sovereignty.\nLearn more about Inference Labs and Omron\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Funding\n#AI\n#Web3\n#Staking\nDisclaimer.

Buonanno pointed to 2016 when Dubai initially launched its Blockchain Strategy.\nHe highlighted how robust regulatory frameworks have since been established by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)  and the Abu Dhabi Global Market finance center (ADGM) in Dubai’s capital, which have “served to drive market maturity.”\nWe feel that now is the perfect time to double down on this momentum.

It could bring in “billions of new [blockchain] users.”","title":"AI-powered smart contracts could be ‘transformative’ — Ava Labs founder","detailed_content":"“Smart contract programming is hard,” said Emin Gün Sirer, founder of Ava Labs, which built the Avalanche blockchain. Capturing “intent” is difficult. Coding is tricky. Verification remains a challenge. \n“This is the main problem that is keeping smart contracts from flourishing,” added Sirer, speaking at the recent Cornell Blockchain Conference in New York City.\nBut imagine if artificial intelligence (AI) “agents” like ChatGPT or Llama could do all that smart contract coding for you. Lawyers, as opposed to coders, might soon become the dominant writers of smart contracts.\nEven more interesting, everyday people would be able to write smart contracts in their native language — peer-to-peer — almost as easily as they write bank checks today.\nThat is the future, suggested Sirer at the April 26 event held at Cornell Tech’s stunning Roosevelt Island campus in New York City, further explaining:\n“All of you are familiar with writing checks, right? That’s the maximum complexity instrument that my retail bank offers to me. At present, you have few options. You can write a check to ‘John’ that essentially says ‘I hereby transfer to John $5,000’ — and that’s about it.”\nBut suppose that you could do the same thing but add additional instructions, Sirer continued, for example:\n“‘I hereby give John $5,000 if and only if he can collect $5 million by the end of September to film a movie. And if he can’t do it, then I want my money back.’ I can just write this.”\nSirer said the scenario he envisions is still five to 10 years away, but if and when it does come, it will be “transformative.”\nWe would “be able to onboard billions of new [blockchain] users.”\nAt present, most smart contracts are written in Solidity, a computer language that remains obscure even among programmers.\nBut Avalanche has begun building a new virtual machine at the intersection of AI and blockchains, Sirer said, which is “programmed in a natural language. You write your programs in English, German, French, Tagalog, Chinese [...] a natural language that your mother taught you in your mother’s tongue.”\nQuestions remain\nBut is all this just pie in the sky? Many issues need to be resolved before these “coin-operated agents,” as Sirer calls them, can be widely deployed.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nLegalities need to be worked out. Keywords and terms will have to be defined unambiguously. A word like “software,” for instance, might have to be very carefully defined before it can be used in smart contracts involving software licenses. All this could take some time.\nRecent: EU crypto regulations undermined by lack of enforcement, say observers\nThen, too, AI “agents” may not be quite ready to write legally binding documents. Large language models (LLMs) can “hallucinate,” after all.\n“Everybody has seen [AI-generated] pictures of seven-fingered people,” Sirer noted.\nBut there are short-term solutions for some of these problems. One could submit transactions to both ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama, for example, requiring both agents to agree before a smart contract solution is accepted. “So that way, at least, you get two trusted executors, and you are taking the intersection of their actions.”\n“Plain English instructions” for smart contracts\nOthers suggest that smart contracts that can handle “natural” language are already here — or at least close at hand.\n“The capability to allow every individual to be their own programmer exists in the world today,” Sam Friedman, principal solutions architect at Chainlink Labs, told Cointelegraph.\nFriedman cited Council, the AI agent framework developed by ChainML, a project in the Chainlink BUILD program, that “enables developers to provide plain English instructions immediately converted into executable code. Today, that code is mostly Python or SQL. But enabling smart contracts is an upgrade away.”\nHe also mentioned Chainlink Developer Hub’s “Ask AI,” which can return a fully formed smart contract when a user submits a request in plain English, something on the order of: “Show me an example smart contract that enables a user to request a random number between one and ten. It should use Chainlink VRF.”\nToday’s offerings probably don’t have the full functionality that Sirer envisions, however, and Friedman told Cointelegraph that a lot of work lies ahead.\n“While AI agents writing smart contracts are already here, this isn’t their final form,” he said. They will still need to improve in terms of quality and complexity. “AI models need to be trained with ever-newer content for this to happen.”\nStill, Friedman can imagine use cases where multiple AI “agents” with distinct roles collaborate to complete the lifecycle management of a smart contract. For instance:\n“One agent helps define the requirements, another writes the smart contract, another performs quality and security testing, another deploys the contracts, and the last one performs ongoing maintenance or tuning of the parameters or global variables in the contract after it’s deployed.”\nThere are still “big unknowns,” Sirer acknowledged at the Cornell Tech conference, and moving the needle forward will require guidance from all sorts of individuals, “people with both a technology and an ethics and a humanities background.”\nA place for lawyers, too?\nIn a question period following his presentation, Sirer was asked who would write smart contracts if Solidity was no longer required and coding could be done in ASCII text.\nSource: SV\n“Who are going to be the best programmers for this?” At first glance, software programmers would seem to have the edge. They are already skilled in defining and specifying conditions in precise language, after all.\nRecent: Where to store your crypto: Wallets provide diverse options for holders\n“But the people who know how to use regular language for specifying contracts are the lawyers. So they are going to be the kings and queens of that universe […] the ones who really figure out how to flourish in this system.”\nAnd average users? “I think they are quite capable of specifying basic transactions,” Sirer said. Indeed, he foresees these new capabilities being built on “democratic, open platforms” that “anyone can use on an equal footing.”\nOverall, this new approach to smart contracts is so interesting and full of promise “that we can’t just leave it on the table,” Sirer concluded.\nExchange or buy AVAX\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

RSN enables tokenized assets like Treasurys, investment-grade debt instruments and money from commercial banks to be settled collectively.\nCurrently, securities such as investment-grade debt and assets such as money from commercial banks function on different systems. Using RSN, settlement procedures will occur on a single platform by converting various assets into tokens and settling them on a distributed ledger.\nThe current trial phase expands on a 12-week pilot phase that started in late 2022. The test was earlier focused on cross-border and domestic dollar payments between banks. The ongoing proof-of-concept (PoC) RSN trials are focused on simulating settlements in the United States dollar.\nIn a May 8 statement, Mastercard said the project is focused on increasing the efficiency of cross-border settlements and reducing the chance of error and fraud.\nRaj Dhamodharan, head of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, said that the “application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures — where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless.”\nRelated: Visa and Mastercard: A boon for wallet holders, a threat to crypto exchanges?\nThe RSN PoC has seen two significant additions to the participating banking institutions: interbank tokenized deposit networks, in which the USDF Consortium will be a direct participant, and the Tassat Group will be a contributor, and another banking giant, Deloitte, provides advisory services.

The company covers alpha primary and secondary investment layouts of projects from different scales in varying ecological niches.\nIn this interview, FutureMoney Group co-founders Steven Li and Eo Hao draw an insightful image of the current DePIN landscape and how it can expand the Web3 space.\nCointelegraph: How do you see the current state of the DePIN ecosystem?\nSteven Li: FutureMoney Group has been focusing on the DePIN area and has invested in many portfolios. We have tried our best to cover the different subdivisions of the DePIN sector so we have a more intuitive understanding of the development of the DePIN ecosystem. \nThe DePIN ecosystem mainly has the following characteristics: \nDePIN is an important starting point and manifestation of the extension of the Web3 field to the traditional world.\nCompared with other popular tracks such as Bitcoin (BTC) ecology, including layers, modular blockchains and restake, DePIN is the easiest to be accepted by traditional funds and understood by traditional users.\nThe DePIN and AI tracks mostly overlap, and there is a tendency for the tracks to merge.\nDePIN is closely integrated with hardware. Currently, the main focus is on the mobile terminal, vehicle terminal and mining machine terminal.\nThe narrative of DePIN is mainly the combination of hardware and token economics. By adding the AI track and emphasizing the staking function, DePINFi and AIFi will explode in the future, with DePIN as the core.\nCT: FutureMoney Group is known as the first VC focusing on the DePIN field in Asia, closing a $20 million fund to invest in DePIN-related products and services. What has attracted the FutureMoney Group to the DePIN space?\nEo Hao: The reason why we chose DePIN is that, on the one hand, we believe that after experiencing multiple rounds of bull markets, the overall market value of Web3 has expanded several times, and the Bitcoin ETF has been passed, the possibility and necessity of being connected to the real world has become imminent.\nDePIN is a good starting point and expression that combines the two worlds. On the other hand, because some of the LPs behind us include the largest hardware manufacturers in the Asian market, including electric vehicle manufacturing companies and mining farms listed in the United States, we pay special attention to the upstream and downstream related to blockchain and hardware.\nEO is sharing DePIN opportunities on Web3 festival 2024. Source: FutureMoney Group\nCT: Could you share the story of the FutureMoney Group? When did you establish the company?\nSL: Co-founder Eo Hao and I started to invest in blockchain and encryption projects in 2016. In addition to buying BTC and Ether (ETH), we are also individual investors in BAT, Loopring, Qtum and other projects. After experiencing the ICO craze in 2017, we started investing in early crypto projects in early 2018 with a total of $1.5 million from our family, friends and our own savings.\nThe two co-founders of FutureMoney Group are Eo Hao and Steven Li. Source: FutureMoney Group\nAlthough this amount cannot be counted as our official first fund, we started from a personal landmark event when an investor transformed into a company.\nCT: What was your initial goal when starting FutureMoney Group, and what are your goals now?\nSL: Because Eo and I both have financial technology backgrounds, our initial interest in blockchain technology also came from the belief that it would revolutionize the financial system. We established this fund to find the next generation of “money\" through investment, so the company Named FutureMoney.\nAfter several years of development and upgrading, we have developed from the initial venture capital business to a holding company in the crypto field covering asset management, mining, fund of funds and incubators, so after 2021, we officially changed the company name to FutureMoney Group. We hope to continue supporting early-stage startups by delving deeper into the crypto field through our methods while opening the window for more Asian investors to allocate crypto assets.\nCT: Where does FutureMoney Group stand now? Could you detail your investment practices and portfolio?\nEH: Our current investment theme is the Future of Work. As mentioned, FMG is the most professional investment institution on the DePIN track. Messari has included us, and DePIN Buddy has listed us as one of the most professional investment institutions on the DePIN track. Together with Borderless, Multicoin is equally famous.\nOur expertise is reflected in the depth and breadth of our DePIN Portfolio layout. We have three products:\nDePIN Surf focuses on very early and low-market-value Alpha projects. Over 50 projects have been applied, of which we selected a total of 23 in the two phases and for projects that have issued tokens.\nDePIN Index covers 24 high-quality projects in the industry, including RNDR, TAO, Theta, Nosana and Mobile. We have established positions in all of them; from its establishment on Dec. 28, 2023, to now, the overall revenue in one quarter has nearly doubled, reaching 91.9 percent.\nIn addition, we have major market investments: 25 projects, including Powerpod, JDI, GEDONET and ETHStorage.\nCT: What are your most significant milestones so far?\nSL: We successfully launched the world’s first DePIN Index and were listed by Messari as a representative DePIN VC in Asia in their DePIN mapping.\nWe cooperate with the IOTEX Foundation for the Depin Surf. We are also working with China Bridge Capital and well-known hardware equipment manufacturers that supply hardware to Apple and Tesla.\nCT: How do you see the future of the DePIN space?\nEH: If many hot spots such as BTC ecology, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Ethereum are the in-depth internal builds of the Web3 industry and seek deeper research, then DePIN, AI and RWA are helping Web3 expand its breadth.\nBoth have huge market potential, and the Bitcoin ecosystem is also a trillion-dollar market.

The blockchain space is getting crowded and complex day by day, with no sign of cooling down, all the while gaining wider mainstream traction with each bullish trend.\nAs a matter of course, the growth of the blockchain ecosystem is accompanied by the constant emergence of new use cases. Blockchain’s full potential may be achieved when the technology is applied in varying fields, which highlights the urgent need for different blockchains to be interoperable.\nHowever, blockchains do not have the ability to work interoperable intrinsically. Lack of interoperability leads to uncertainties for businesses and users, discouraging them from interacting with blockchains and hindering the technologies’ adoption.\nLack of interoperability\nThe fragmentation in the space is a challenge for developers as well. A research shows that developing a basic blockchain application takes more than three months on average, and things get tougher when it comes to interoperable applications. There is not an established standard of systems and languages between technologies.\nMoreover, the novelty of the space means there are fewer experienced developers than in traditional industries, even though building a cross-chain application from scratch requires intensive knowledge of all chains included and powerful tools to support developers in their endeavors.\nAddressing these challenges is essential for blockchain to achieve its full potential as a game-changer technology and be adopted within mainstream industries. Omnichain solutions like Dojima target the aforementioned issues by employing a holistic approach to blockchain development.\nUniversal omnichain layer for all blockchains\nDojima is a cross-chain platform that unites numerous protocols with varying architecture and consensus mechanisms. It offers a universal layer where both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM chains like Bitcoin can interact.\nThe platform focuses on creating an omnichain hub on which all kinds of blockchains — proof-of-work or proof-of-stake — coexist and seamlessly integrate them for both developers and users. By pooling assets and data from different chains, Dojima simplifies the development and deployment of complex cross-chain applications.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThe omnichain layer-1 platform places robust infrastructure development at the center of its business and offers unique tools to foster adoption. The developer dashboard, named Magic Dashboard, includes templates for building a wide range of products, such as Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and a deposit manager.\nDevelopment in minutes\nTo eliminate the need to start from scratch for developers, Dojima provides templates that reduce the time to build and deploy omnichain applications from months to less than 5 minutes. By lowering the technical knowledge barrier, the platform also offers a starting place for less tech-savvy developers.\nAn innovative business model, which Dojima calls Functionality-as-a-Service (FaaS), aids such users when developing and using DApp. It is an omnichain API service that interacts and gets data from all integrated chains. FaaS helps ecosystem participants with tasks varying from creating an account and signing transactions to setting gas rates.\nTo make navigation through connected chains easier, Dojima built an omnichain explorer. Just like traditional blockchain scanners, the service functions as a search engine and allows users to access and track transactions on the network.\nDojima offers an omnichain explorer for a holistic view of the blockchain space.\nThe protocol incorporates a cryptocurrency wallet as well. Designed to enable cross-chain interactions between integrated platforms, the Dojima wallet enables users to store, send, receive and swap tokens across different chains, including prominent blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\nDojima is also creating secondary marketplaces for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and derivatives in an effort to attract the users of connected blockchains. The project strives to be a robust, scalable and user-friendly platform that fosters liquidity, development and collaboration.\nBuilding a metaverse in a day\nDojima activated its testnet in late 2022 to let users and developers test the network, which coincided with hackathons organized by the team to attract talent in the space. One outstanding project was a metaverse created in less than a day, where users can buy multiple NFTs with tokens native to Dojima through a VR headset. Throughout 2023, the project expanded its community before jumping on the next step.\nDojima recently launched its stagenet - the alpha version of its mainnet - and temporarily opened up the faucet, a web-based service that sends test tokens to users for experimental use. The stagenet received interaction from more than one hundred unique wallets on its first day. Next for Dojima is the launch of its native token, which is slated for the third quarter.\n“Our vision is to be the cornerstone of the Web3 evolution,” Dojima says in its vision statement. The team aims to establish Dojima Network as “the go-to cross-chain platform that seamlessly connects diverse blockchain networks.”\n“By continually attracting top talent and leveraging support from industry leaders, we aim to revolutionize how developers, users and protocols interact and expand within the blockchain universe, making Dojima Network synonymous with innovation, collaboration, and growth in the Web3 space.”\nBy creating a marketplace for diverse blockchains, providing powerful tools and simplifying the building process, Dojima envisions a future where its solution becomes the standard for blockchain interoperability.\nLearn more about Dojima\n#Blockchain\n#Cryptocurrencies\n#Decentralization\n#Adoption\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.

In this case, billions of dollars worth of ‘free money’ and data could land in hackers’ hands if they start migrating on the real owners’ behalf, making the affected blockchains immediately worthless.”\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nHowever, the new QANplatform testnet will enable EVM-compatible protocols to test their migration process for a quantum-resistant alternative, without risking user funds on the mainnet.\nThe testnet announcement comes nearly two months after the first European country adopted QANplatform’s quantum-resistant technology in March. The tech stack protects against quantum computing attacks on government-owned cybersecurity infrastructure.\nRelated: Robinhood crypto business slapped with SEC Wells notice\nQuantum security is already a significant concern in 2024\nGovernments worldwide are already preparing for a post-quantum era. In 2018, the European Commission launched the Quantum Flagship research initiative with a budget of at least 1 billion euros ($1.078 billion) and a duration of 10 years.\nThese efforts are justified, considering that quantum computing is already presenting a significant security threat for everyday internet users, according to QANplatform’s Polecsak. He said:\n“Quantum-resistant technology is important already today because of the ‘store now, decrypt later’ cybersecurity threat that involves attackers collecting encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it later using more powerful computing methods, such as quantum computers.”\nLarge companies are also gearing up for a post-quantum future. Apple unveiled a new update in February that aims to future-proof iMessages with post-quantum cryptography, making Apple the first among a handful of quantum-proof messaging providers.\nThe Signal messaging app also launched a “quantum-resistant” encryption upgrade in September 2023, but Apple says it’s the first to reach “level 3” encryption.\nWhile quantum computers may take more time to develop, post-quantum security needs to be ahead of the curve, as quantum computers with stable qubits will be able to break today’s main cybersecurity algorithms, according to Polecsak:\n“Today’s asymmetric cryptographic algorithms like RSA and EC used by the whole internet — including governments, banks, email providers, social media, blockchain platforms, etc. — will be cracked by quantum computers.”\nRelated: Crypto options desk QCP Capital wins Abu Dhabi license: Report\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.

Kelp offers a compelling answer with a blend of blockchain, on-chain data, and monetary theorem.","title":"Is Kelp the key to a more stable future for crypto: AMA recap","detailed_content":"With traditional fiat currencies facing inflation concerns and the volatility of cryptocurrencies posing a challenge, Kelp offers a novel solution. CEO and co-founder Edward Bishop discussed Kelp\u0027s unique monetary policy-based approach during Cointelegraph\u0027s recent AMA.\nKelp AMA - Achieving Stability in Crypto https://t.co/Cuu1nDfjIR\n— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 22, 2024\n\"We\u0027re neither a traditional fiat-backed stablecoin nor an algorithmic coin, but rather a flatcoin,\" Bishop said, describing the essence of Kelp. \"It\u0027s a hybrid of the two that adjusts its supply to inflation in the real economy and maintains its purchasing power over time. We use a monetary theory called the quantity theory of money. It is codified in our protocol, which monitors economic activity and predicts the ideal circulating supply to maintain price stability.\"\nThe Kelp Protocol, at the heart of the Kelp ecosystem, uses various economic indicators to understand market conditions. For example, if Kelp experiences rapid price increases, the protocol could adjust supply to reduce volatility.\nCurrently, Kelp is in a seed phase, which Bishop described as \"very experimental.\" He identified two main goals for this phase: to reach parity with the U.S. dollar and to ensure a minimum amount of coins are in circulation. Once these goals are achieved, the price is expected to find equilibrium and fluctuate naturally. The price range may adjust based on market demand, and may expand as demand for Kelp increases.\nBishop mentioned several levers to achieve these goals: \"We have different systems to get there. For example, staking helps us temporarily lock up supply. Basically, it incentivizes users to hold $KELP instead of trading it, effectively reducing the amount of supply in circulation. On the other hand, we have a variable taker fee, which is tied to the liquidity pool and increases when the price goes down.\"\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nHe then delved into the seed phase they\u0027re going through: \"Part of the initial phase is getting Kelp Protocol to make accurate predictions, so we do a lot of simulations to figure out what the expected effect is. There are algorithms that determine interest rates and token release strategy, which is our guiding protocol for the seed phase. For people who want to sell, we have Liquidity Guard. If we take these three emission sources and then use the difference between what the Kelp Protocol tells us and what our supply should be, and use it to modify different variables in our ecosystem, we can achieve our short-term goals.\nBishop described the Liquidity Guard as a smart contract that allows users in challenging situations to sell their Kelp holdings through the contract at an optimal time, bypassing the variable taker fee. In return, Kelp manages the sale responsibly to minimize market impact. The contract prioritizes user needs with different fee tiers based on urgency.\nCompared to traditional central banks, Bishop highlighted Kelp\u0027s quicker adjustments because Kelp uses on-chain data, allowing for faster and more accurate monitoring of economic activity. At the same time, he acknowledged the need for a delicate balance, as overreaction can be detrimental. In the event of extreme market volatility, Kelp can use collateralized assets as a backstop, similar to how central banks conduct open market operations, meaning Kelp can perform buybacks to stabilize the price during a crash.\nAccording to Bishop, Kelp prioritizes building a large user base and targets 1-2 million users for the official launch. They are allocating 25 billion Kelp tokens through the Kelp Reservation Program, which can be earned through referrals or by completing gamified tasks. All of this is available through the Kelp app, which also serves as a self-custodial Web3 wallet.\nBishop also mentioned an upcoming feature for the Kelp app - K.A.T.E, an algorithmic trading engine. It will analyze users\u0027 risk profiles and investment goals, and use hedge fund algorithms to create personalized investment portfolios that suggest assets (crypto, stocks, or both) to buy and hold.\nKelp is currently in its third round of pre-sales. Bishop emphasized that Kelp avoids VC funding and prioritizes raising funds through the pre-sale and user base to ensure wider accessibility and align with their \"money for all\" philosophy.\nHe continued: \"We are trying to reach a certain liquidity threshold because we want to do this in a very responsible way and make sure that we have a substantial liquidity pool. It\u0027s essential for a number of functionalities, including facilitating K.A.T.E. operations and strengthening Kelp\u0027s overall collateralization. When we get to a certain liquidity threshold, we\u0027ll move into a launchpad for the IEO scenario.\"\n\"Our goal is not to control the market, but to make it behave a certain way,\" Bishop emphasized. \"Kelp is definitely very different from, say, Luna and Terra. We don\u0027t try to control supply or have a two-token system, we avoid controlling the market with brute force. We are just pulling different levers - interest rates, variable fees, supply increases that are allocated to different programs. Ultimately, we want to become a reliable unit of account, something people use for everyday transactions.”\nLearn more about Kelp\n#Blockchain\n#Tokens\n#Stablecoin\n#DeFi\n#Liquidity\nDisclaimer.

Armed with powerful computer hardware, miners search for a 64-digit hexadecimal code that validates a block of transactions. This code (also called a hash) is found through a process called hashing. \nHashing requires computer hardware to sift through trillions of hashes to find one that matches a block’s difficulty (also called target hash). Once miners find a block’s target hash, they can verify its transactions are genuine and will issue a block confirmation. The network then releases more Bitcoin (BTC).\nFinding the target hash can take miners a long time. The amount of time varies based on many factors, such as the Bitcoin network’s current mining difficulty. A difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks and raises or lowers based on the number of miners contributing. More miners means a higher difficulty, while fewer miners means a lower difficulty. \nMining rigs abide by Bitcoin’s mining algorithm, SHA-256. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function used in password hashing and digital signature verification, among other applications. In the case of Bitcoin, it is used for hashing.\nA new block is mined every 10 minutes, and the network releases a fixed amount of Bitcoin and distributes it to miners. This release of Bitcoin is called a block reward. Before the Bitcoin halving in April 2024, the block reward was 6.25 per block. The Bitcoin halving event reduced this reward to 3.125 Bitcoin, with halvings occurring roughly every four years. This halving process was programmed by Bitcoin’s creator and is designed to create digital scarcity and maintain the value of Bitcoin, which also dramatically affects mining profitability.\nBitcoin’s creator programmed the network to halve every 210,000 blocks (around every four years) to create digital scarcity. At this rate, Bitcoin won’t hit its 21 million cap until 2140.\nAt that point, miners will still earn rewards through transaction fees but will no longer release new Bitcoin into the network.\nWhat’s the average time needed to mine a single Bitcoin?\nThe length of time it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin can vary.\nEach committed Bitcoin block releases 3.125 Bitcoin. To answer the central question in mind, it takes an average of 10 minutes to mine not just 1 Bitcoin but 3 — and that rate will fluctuate over time. But, due to the massive amount of computing power it takes to mine a single block (otherwise known as block time), it’s almost impossible for one miner to receive all 3.125 of the reward.\nHow long does it take for one person to mine 1 Bitcoin? This number will range significantly due to the miner’s hardware. For example, some miners have dozens, if not hundreds, of pieces of mining hardware in an attempt to increase their hash rate. In that case, they will likely earn more Bitcoin per block than other miners with a lower hash rate. Many miners join a mining pool to contribute to Bitcoin mining in a meaningful way.\nA mining pool is a group of miners all contributing their hash rate as one entity in hopes of finding a target hash. In doing so, miners earn rewards based on their hash rate contribution.\nRewards are distributed by a mining pool operator, who often charges a mining pool fee. However, miners can contribute to different types of mining pools.\nProportional\nA proportional mining pool distributes rewards based on a miner’s hash rate contribution. They can also earn additional rewards through transaction fees.\nPay per last N groups\nPay per last N groups mining pools distribute miners into shifts and pay them out based on their time on “shift.” A shift is a set period in which the miner contributes to the mining pool.\nPay-per-share\nPay-per-share pools provide miners with a fixed income, expecting them to contribute a certain amount of their hash rate daily. While this is a stable way to mine Bitcoin, it removes a miner’s ability to earn transaction fees.\nHow hard is it to solo mine Bitcoin?\nSolo mining Bitcoin involves one miner competing with every other miner globally. \nBitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol makes mining a natural competition. The chances of a solo miner beating the rest of the world to a block’s target hash are nearly zero — no matter their mining rigs’ power.\nIn Bitcoin’s early days, mining difficulty was relatively low due to the lack of miners. Block rewards were also much higher, with miners earning dozens of Bitcoin per block. However, Bitcoin was worth less than $1 back then, so the reward was a bit more fitting.\nPresently, solo miners join cryptocurrency mining pools to have any chance of earning rewards from Bitcoin mining. Potential miners without a powerful mining rig can also join a cloud mining service to save on the initial investment cost. \nCloud mining services consist of miners leasing out their hashing power via the cloud and asking users to pay for a share of it. As a result, the miners offload some energy consumption costs to paying users. In return, paying users earn block rewards based on their share of hashing power.\nHow to earn 1 Bitcoin per day without investment?\nIt takes money to make money. Earning Bitcoin without investment is nearly impossible, but there are inexpensive ways to get involved.\nIt is nearly impossible to earn 1 Bitcoin per day without investment. Bitcoin mining requires energy consumption, which miners pay through their electricity bills. Moreover, Bitcoin mining is intended to get harder and harder over time. It requires a lot of electricity and specialized, pricey hardware. \nIt is almost hard for an individual to mine 1 Bitcoin per day, even with substantial expenditure. Anyone wishing to mine Bitcoin would have to compete with powerful mining operations, with their economies of scale giving them a significant competitive edge over individual miners.\nAs of May 6, 2024, 1 Bitcoin is worth $64,116. Earning this much daily without investment would heavily destabilize the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, beware of websites or programs claiming to help you earn 1 Bitcoin daily for free. These are often scams designed to exploit people looking for quick returns.\nThose looking to invest in crypto mining should first learn about crypto trading, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets. Over time, they might be able to turn minor investments into larger sums of money with the right information and approaches.","tags":[],"author":"by Max Moeller","creation_date":"2024-05-07"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/kronos-research-hacker-funds-tornado-cash-exploit","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Kronos Research was exploited for $25 million in November 2023, with one of the six wallets linked to the hacker moving funds to Tornado Cash on May 7.","title":"Kronos Research hacker shifts funds to Tornado Cash","detailed_content":"The hacker behind the $25 million exploit of quantitative trading firm Kronos Research in mid-November 2023 started moving funds nearly six months after the exploit.\nThe hacker wallet first transferred 1,314 Ether\nETH\n$3,033\nworth $4 million to a new address, starting with 0x8F5e4 and later transferred all the ETH to another address starting with 0x164A24b.\nSource: PeckShield\nThe hacker made 10 transactions of 100 ETH from the final wallet and transferred it to Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing tool.\nThe hacker made several transfers to Tornado Cash.

Project founders and users from across the crypto ecosystem are chiming in as a result. \n“The reality is that, in all likelihood, the era of life-changing airdrops is now behind us,” said Leandro Schlottchauer, co-founder and CEO of smart contract developer Kuyen Labs, in a statement. “It should be clear by now that no airdrop or similar incentive can satisfy all community members,” he continued, adding: \n\"Community members have been divided on the core team’s plans, including the amount to be airdropped to early contributors and the limited number of jurisdictions from which users will be able to claim.\"\nMeanwhile, Mohak Agarwal, CEO and founder of liquid-staking protocol Claystack, said EigenLayer’s decision to announce its airdrop as a surprise is not a workable model for the long term. “While the mysterious approach may initially evoke excitement, it often leads to disappointment later on,” said Agarwal. “This pattern suggests a tendency for projects to announce a small airdrop supply initially, anticipating user disappointment, and then offering additional tokens to appease them — a short-term fix that isn’t sustainable in the long run.”\nIn a surprise blog post on April 29, EigenLayer, the second-largest decentralized finance protocol with $15.67 billion in total value locked, unveiled its airdrop plans where among other items, only 5% of the initial token supply would be allocated to early users who participated in Season One. The remaining allocation would be distributed to users in the following “seasons.” In addition, users from 30 countries — including the United States, Canada, China and Russia — would not be able to claim EIGEN tokens.\nCountries excluded from the EigenLayer airdrop. Source: Bonecondor\nThe announcement quickly drew widespread community condemnation. “Accepting stake from those countries and not rewarding them isn’t right. They took a very real risk for nothing,” wrote one user on social media platform X in response to the protocol’s geoblocking efforts. In response to community feedback, EigenLayer announced in a follow-up post on May 3 that they would airdrop an additional 28 million EIGEN to 280,000 wallets. \nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nDespite booming development activities within the crypto ecosystem, recent airdrops often failed to follow up on their initial traction. \nOn April 4, cross-chain messaging platform Wormhole transferred $800 million worth of its W tokens to select users, with its post-airdrop valuation surging to a stunning $22 billion measured in fully diluted market capitalization. Since then, however, the token has lost more than 50% of its value and traded at $0.6457 at the time of publication.  \nSimilarly, STRK, the native token of the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Starknet, has lost 43% of its value since its February airdrop. At the time, allegedly, 701,544 eligible wallets were controlled by airdrop farmers who claimed STRK tokens by creating duplicate developers’ accounts on GitHub. \nCointelegraph previously reported that due to their popularity, airdrops have been frequently targeted by farm accounts and Sybil accounts, thereby allocating large swaths of tokens to otherwise unqualified accounts instead of to genuine ecosystem users. \"As a result, a project’s reputation is damaged, its token supply inflates, and price manipulation may occur as a result of excessive dumping by airdrop farmers after the event is over,\" commented researchers at Gamic HQ regarding the practice. \nRelated: EigenLayer users fume over restrictive airdrop, others say it’s ‘generous’\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Despite the massive interaction opportunities introduced by social media, traditional marketing efforts still put the user at the end of the communication chain — hence the name ‘end user.’\nPlagued by ineffective targeting, over 95% of digital marketing efforts see no conversion, which then results in almost $240 billion of marketing budget wasted on inefficient ads.

Using token mentions on X, projects like BlockGames (BLOCK) and Portal Coin (PORTAL) hit a home run with their marketing campaigns.\nBy initiating token airdrops for tweets, retweets, quotes, replies and likes on posts mentioning their tokens, those two projects succeeded in keeping the community actively engaged. As a result, the PORTAL token surged to 68 times its initial value, while Block Games amassed almost a million followers on X, emphasizing the effectiveness of the social farming model.\nHowever, as Web3 airdrops are gaining popularity through word of mouth and successful campaigns, they are also attracting bad actors. Farm accounts and bot-powered Sybil attacks continue to harm the efficiency of Web3 marketing campaigns.\nDespite social farming’s potential, bad actors exploit the system through minimal engagement or bots, undermining the support genuine users provide. This dilutes the value intended for deserving community members and stifles project growth.\nSo, how can Web3 marketing campaigns minimize bot attacks and token farming while encouraging meaningful engagement from the community?\nAI-powered Web3 marketing\nEmerging as a game changer for virtually all industries that operate in the digital realm, artificial intelligence (AI) holds the key to building better MarketingFi dynamics. Combining AI with Web3 data and wallet analytics has the potential to prevent bots and token farmers who have no interest in the project from impacting the related airdrop campaign.\nOne such project using AI-powered analytics to incentivize genuine community interaction is Cookie3, an AI data layer designed for the MarketingFi space.\nCookie3 is a strategic partner of Cookie DAO, a collective of MarketingFi enthusiasts banded together to bolster decentralization through innovative blockchain solutions. Issued by Cookie DAO, the COOKIE3 token finds its utility in the AI-powered MarketingFi ecosystem built by Cookie3.\nThe Cookie3 ecosystem aims to deliver a transparent marketing economy by adding an AI data layer to MarketingFi campaigns, unlocking value for stakeholders — users, creators and businesses — of the Web3 ecosystem.\nCookie3 seeks to deliver value for businesses, creators and users in MarketingFi campaigns.

The system effectively filters out bots and malicious actors, enabling projects to reward quality users with access to airdrops, specialized campaigns and exclusive events.\nEstablishing new standards for Web3\nBuilding a streamlined social farming ecosystem has paid off for Cookie3 and Cookie DAO, as the COOKIE token airdrop campaign attracted over 100,000 participants in less than a week. “The COOKIE Airdrop conducted by Cookie DAO builds upon the learning and success of Portal coin’s and Block Game’s social farming campaigns,” said Filip Wielanier, CEO and co-founder of Cookie3.\nHow AI and MarketingFi create a value cycle between users, projects and creators. Source: Cookie3\nHe added that the airdrop utilizes Cookie3 analytics and AI technology to create a viral marketing phenomenon. The main goal is to become the new airdrop and social farming standard. “It’s not just about spreading awareness but cultivating a community where every interaction counts,” Wielanier summarized.\nWeb3 enhances user engagement by leveraging blockchain’s transparency and traceability, transforming how community interactions are valued. By utilizing AI to score both on- and off-chain actions, rewards are more effectively directed to genuinely engaged users.

These fees can vary significantly, making it important to monitor crypto transactions closely. A user can identify patterns and develop strategies to minimize costs by analyzing transaction history. Viewing transaction history can help with tracking and transaction analysis.\nA cryptocurrency holder can perform transaction tracking in various ways, such as utilizing the search function on a blockchain explorer. This article provides a step-by-step guide on checking crypto transaction logs and where to find the historical data, which is crucial for transaction analysis.\nWhere to check crypto transactions history\nUsers can employ several strategies for transaction viewing:\n1. Blockchain explorer\nBlockchain explorers are blockchain-specific, meaning they only work with the particular blockchain they’re designed for. A blockchain explorer is a tool that reveals records on the crypto ledger.\nMost explorers are open to the public, enabling the viewing of all transactions initiated and completed on a blockchain network. Each entry contains transaction details, such as the amount, timestamp and the sender and receiver’s address.\nBlockchain explorers have an intuitive user interface (UI), allowing users to search for all transactions, blocks, wallet addresses and digital asset history. It keeps track of all cryptocurrency records, enabling the confirmation of transaction status, block and wallet balance. A blockchain explorer can help diagnose a transaction or wallet balance issue.\nExamples of cryptocurrency explorers include:\nbtcscan.org/ - Bitcoin\netherscan.io - Ethereum\nsolscan.io - Solana\nlive.blockcypher.com/ltc/ - Litecoin\nbithomp.com/explorer - XRP\nA user can use the explorer to verify the transaction history details of a wallet by entering the wallet’s address in the explorer’s search bar. This method is also effective for a cold wallet, which is not connected to the internet, by first securely accessing the address of the cold wallet to search for its transaction history. Before using this functionality, taking appropriate security measures to protect your funds and private keys is crucial.\n2. Crypto wallet\nIf the searcher used a wallet to transfer tokens, they can use its cryptocurrency records to access the transaction history. A wallet records all the registered incoming and outgoing transactions in the history section of the wallet. Click any transaction to view its details.\n3. Third-party services\nSome third-party platforms can offer insights into transaction histories as they can provide a feed of all transactions. These platforms have a user-friendly interface that displays aggregated data from a blockchain.\nMost third-party platforms allow users to view transactions on desktops or smart devices. They allow users to filter transactions using parameters, such as the amount, date and transaction or token type, presenting the results in an easy-to-understand format.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nSimilarly, the cryptocurrency market has plenty of crypto wallet tracker tools that help track wallet transactions. By entering the search query, a user will gain access to transaction history, investment patterns and potentially some wallet-holder information (if the network allows for reduced anonymity).\n4. Downloading the entire blockchain\nExpert users can download the entire blockchain history by running a full node. This gives them offline access to local searches rather than relying on online resources.\nHowever, running a full archival node can be resource-intensive and requires significant storage space. For instance, it is not unusual for the node to require 340 gigabytes of space the first time a user runs it.\nHow to view crypto transaction history on a blockchain explorer\nUsers may follow these steps when using a blockchain explorer to view transaction history:\nStep 1: Go to the search field on the blockchain explorer.\nStep 2: Enter the details of the crypto transaction. The explorer allows users to search by different parameters like the sender’s or receiver’s address, transaction ID, transaction date or the block hash where the transaction data is stored.\nIf the results do not display after entering the search query, click “search” or the search button to start the search.\nStep 3: If the user enters the right transaction details on the search bar, they will receive a result or a list of the possible results that could match the transaction under search.\nTo find a particular transaction, enter the exact details of the transaction, such as the transaction hash or the exact amount sent.\nStep 4: Click on the desired transaction to enter the transaction page, which provides further details about the transaction. View or download/export the transaction(s) for analysis, or copy a transaction ID and send it to anyone needing proof.\nHow to utilize a blockchain explorer to view wallet history\nInstead of logging into a wallet to view transaction history, a user can follow these steps to view the transaction history of a crypto wallet:\nStep 1: Go to the search bar of a blockchain explorer.\nStep 2: Enter the exact wallet address on the search bar. It’s preferable to copy-paste the address from the wallet app to avoid errors. Click the “search” or search button.\nN/B: Ensure the wallet under search is compatible with the blockchain explorer.\nStep 3: The search results will display the entire digital currency history and the assets present in the wallet. View the different categories, including analytics and public comments on the wallet.\nHow to use wallet activity to view transaction history\nThe multichain Exodus wallet is used for illustrative purposes to access wallet transaction history:\nStep 1: After logging into Exodus, click the wallet icon.\nStep 2: Locate and click the portfolio button. Users with multiple portfolios should click the corresponding portfolio for which they want to view the transaction history. Those with only one portfolio should skip to step 3.\nStep 3: Click the profile button at the bottom. Select the history button to view historical transactions.\nStep 4: To narrow the search, click the “All” drop-down menu to filter the transactions using options like sent, received or exchanged transactions.\nStep 5: Click on a transaction to view its details.\nHow to use third-party services to view the transaction history\nThe Exodus platform will be used to illustrate the use of third-party services for accessing blockchain history:\nStep 1: Click/tap the “History” icon on the Exodus desktop or mobile app. Users should click/tap the portfolio they want to view. If users do not have multiple portfolios, they should skip to the next step.\nStep 2: Filter the results using the “All assets” drop-down menu. The drop-down menu lets users filter results by sent, received and swapped categories. This assists in narrowing down the results, making it easier to locate particular transactions.\nStep 3: Click any individual transaction to scrutinize its details.\nViewing transaction histories by downloading a blockchain\nThe Bitcoin network will be used for illustrative purposes.\nStep 1: Start the initial block download (IBD) process, which involves downloading the entire blockchain and then verifying the blocks. Although the installation process provides a wallet, it only stores and records transactions after installation.\nStep 2: Open the Bitcoin blocks subdirectory to view transaction history. Note that it will show all Bitcoin transactions, not just the users’.\nSince the transactions are indecipherable as they are .dat files, build or link a wallet interface/a web front end that installs a blockchain explorer UI. The wallet or explorer will visually represent the data, making it easier to understand.\nStep 3: If the user installed the wallet or blockchain explorer interface, follow the steps provided in the wallet and explorer sections above to view transaction histories.\nHow to find lost crypto transactions\nFor an investor, tracking out misplaced or lost cryptocurrency transactions can be a tedious experience. The first thing to do is to review existing records in detail. This includes looking through a cryptocurrency wallet’s transaction history, reviewing exchange statements to look for missing transactions, and looking through emails to find confirmations from exchanges or wallets.\nThe transaction can be tracked using a blockchain explorer for the relevant cryptocurrency if a fragment of the transaction hash or wallet address is known. If investors need help finding the lost transaction history, they may also contact their exchange support or wallet provider.\nSpecialized data recovery services for lost cryptocurrency transactions are also available; however, they should be utilized cautiously because they may involve costs, and scams are unfortunately prevalent in this area. Furthermore, to prevent the headache of lost transactions, investors should diligently maintain organized wallet histories, save all exchange statements, and archive any emails or bank statements related to their cryptocurrency transactions.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Source: Jameson Lopp\nLopp explained that as a result of these “block storms” the network stands at a current block height of 2,811,000, which is the equivalent of where the Bitcoin mainnet would be in 2061.\nLopp noted that due to the vast increase in the testnet’s block height, the rewards for testnet miners had been reduced to near zero, making the network practically unusable for developers looking for new tokens.\nRelated: Someone ‘shit in the jacuzzi’ — Bitcoiners furious after testnet griefing\nAdditionally, Lopp said that the now-scarce testnet Bitcoin was being co-opted by certain projects looking to take advantage of the token’s scarcity.\n“It’s not uncommon for malicious folks to prey upon people’s naïveté and sell them testnet bitcoin at mainnet Bitcoin exchange rates,” he said.\nHe pointed to a recent example of a Bitcoin-based layer-2 network dubbed SatoshiVM, which had been using TBTC to distribute airdrops to its holders as an example of a project that had been creating artificial value on the testnet for its own purposes.\nHe called out several projects, including a decentralized exchange called MotoSwap and a brokerage firm called Buy Tesnet for selling testnet tokens to users.\n“The sole reason I’m advocating for a testnet reset is because testnet is supposed to be free for developers to use. Other than that, everyone should be free to use testnet for whatever development purpose they wish.”\n“It’s important for every wallet that supports testnet to have a bold disclaimer on the main screen that testnet coins have no value!” Lopp added.\nUltimately, Lopp concluded that the only way to ensure a testnet does not accrue value is to “instill a culture of regular resets” and advised Bitcoin developers and users to migrate their infrastructure to “testnet4” in the coming months.\nMagazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?","tags":["#Bitcoin","#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Adoption","#Community","#Bitcoin Mining","#Developers","#Jameson Lopp"],"author":"by Tom Mitchelhill","creation_date":"2024-05-06"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-reaches-one-billion-transactions","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"Tweet","summary":"An average of 178,475 daily transactions have been made on Bitcoin during its 5,603-day existence.","title":"Bitcoin reaches one billion transactions","detailed_content":"The Bitcoin network has processed its one billionth transaction — marking a huge milestone moment for the network 15 years after its creation.\nClark Moody’s Bitcoin dashboard shows that transaction 1,000,000,000 was processed in block 842,241 at 9:34 pm UTC on May 5.\nTotal number of transactions processed on the Bitcoin network.

Source: Phaver\nPhaver leverages the Lens Protocol created by the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Aave with the goal of enabling users to own their social relationships and interactions through nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Lens Protocol is a decentralized social graph that allows creators to own their content as NFTs.\nIn addition to Lens, Phaver supports decentralized social graphs such as Farcaster, MocaID and CyberConnect. With all supporting social graphs, Phaver makes social connections more secure and permanent by improving user control and enabling interoperability.\nA seamless transition to Web3 social interaction\nCointelegraph Accelerator participant Phaver provides a simple introduction to its platform without requiring any crypto wallet for initial registration. Users can sign up using a traditional email or Web2 login, suitable for those new to Web3 technology. Once registered, users can create a Phaver profile without requiring any blockchain knowledge. For those with a Lens profile, Phaver allows easy integration during the registration process.\nIn the Phaver app, users have the flexibility to personalize their experience. Phaver users can subscribe to various interests or follow other participants. If no specific selection is made, the feed will default to showing the latest popular content so new users can discover exciting discussions and content.\nTo enhance users’ personalized experience further, Phaver incorporates a unique reward system called Cred. Users can connect one or more wallets and start earning Creds and points based on their activity on the platform and the eligible NFTs they own. The score measures users’ reputation within the platform, taking into account their contributions and interactions. Users with higher Cred scores have greater influence and trustworthiness within the community, which encourages positive engagement and discourages malicious behavior.\nCreating a Phaver profile requires no blockchain knowledge, making it accessible to all users. Source: Phaver\nBuilding on its innovative reward system, Phaver is also taking proactive steps to secure the platform against AI manipulations and the creation of fake content by introducing the Anima proof-of-personhood. The platform stores each user’s unique privacy-safe facial print in the user’s wallet. Participants can connect their wallets and complete a facial scan to claim a unique NFT, proving their uniqueness.\nPhaver also offers advanced features, such as purchasing points or participating in gamified social experiences for more meaningful engagement. These features reward the creator and allow the “stakeholder” to earn rewards if the promoted posts become popular.\nKeeping users engaged\nSince its founding, Phaver has reached 300,000 unique app installs, 50,000 weekly active users and $150 million in connected NFT value on Phaver Cred. Behind this data lies user retention ability, a critical metric for any social platform. In South Korea, for example, users spend an average of six hours a week on Phaver, underscoring the app’s ability to keep users engaged.\nPhaver has also formed partnerships that enhance its platform and expand its reach. Notable collaborations include Lotte Group’s NFT arm in Korea and The Smurfs, both of which are exploring and expanding their Web3 footprint.\nPhaver is poised to solidify its position in the Web3 social media space through several strategic initiatives. The platform plans to improve multi-protocol integration by adding support for additional decentralized social graphs such as CyberConnect and Farcaster.\nPhaver is dedicated to creating an internet where users have ownership. Source: Phaver\nPhaver is also preparing to transform the onboarding process for new users with a Web2 background. By making points available for purchase as in-app purchases, Phaver aims to simplify entry into the Web3 space and make it as easy as downloading and interacting with a traditional app.\nMoreover, Phaver will continue to develop its proprietary trust score and expand it to cover a broader range of social metrics. At the same time, the platform is exploring the introduction of NFT-gated topics that will bring together select NFT holders for exclusive discussions and networking opportunities.\nPhaver envisions a future where users can freely engage in decentralized social networks without fear of encountering AI-generated content or bots. By implementing innovations such as the Anima proof-of-personhood platform and Cred scores, the platform aims to mitigate the risks posed by AI threats and foster a more authentic and trustworthy online experience.\nSupporting user-centered platforms that prioritize security, authenticity and community participation will contribute to the development of the crypto and Web3 ecosystem.

Limited by the content they curate and governed by opaque algorithms, streaming services often control what gets produced and what falls by the wayside.\nThe centralization of current streaming services dictates audience choices and limits opportunities for creators. Most funding flows to a select group of large studios capable of producing high-budget projects, leaving independent creators to navigate slow payment cycles and significant barriers to entry.\nGenerative AI to democratize video production\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) technology promises to shift this imbalance. With the ability for individuals or small teams to quickly produce video content that rivals the quality of major studio productions, the traditional power dynamics within the industry are being challenged. The technology enhances production capabilities while democratizing access, enabling a broader range of creators to enter the space.\nReplay, the blockchain developer behind Web3 streaming service Rewarded.TV, is stepping forward with ambitious plans to redefine video creation and distribution using generative AI. With the introduction of its native RPLAY token on the global exchange MEXC, Replay is driving its ecosystem toward a more inclusive model where creators and viewers have direct stakes in the content they produce and consume.\n📢 LISTING IS LIVE ON @MEXC_Official\n\nOur token #RPLAY, powered by @Theta_Network went live earlier today.\n\nMissed it?

The decentralized approach is also embodied in Rewarded.TV, which rewards viewers and creators for their engagement.\nBy recording contributions and viewership activity on-chain, Replay aims to ensure transparency and fairness in how content is valued and compensated. Rewarded.TV is also home to Cyko KO, an NFT-funded cartoon featuring the cast of Napoleon Dynamite — a 2004 cult classic film.\nThe integration of generative AI into Replay’s platform enhances how content is personalized and delivered. Cointelegraph Accelerator participant Replay utilizes generative AI to enable users to generate video content tailored to their preferences and needs from scratch.\nThe process enhances user engagement by transforming viewers into active content co-creators and improves the data pool available to train AI models.

Call options give investors the right to buy a cryptocurrency at a specific price before a certain date. Put options, on the other hand, allow investors to sell a cryptocurrency at a particular price before the expiry date.\nInvestors often use the put/call ratio as a metric to assess the general state of the market. If traders are purchasing more puts than calls, it is considered a bearish sign, and if they are purchasing more calls than puts, then the market sentiment is considered bullish.\nA put-to-call ratio below 0.7 is considered bullish, while a ratio of more than 1 is regarded as a bearish indicator.\nRelated: US lawmakers urge SEC to approve Bitcoin options trading\nOn May 3, a total of 23,367 Bitcoin contracts worth $1.39 billion are set to expire.

This allowed them to withdraw more tokens than were deposited.\nThis is commonly known in the DeFi world as a flash loan attack. This type of attack vector usually involves borrowing large amounts of funds with some form of uncollateralized loan from a lending platform.\nThe attacker then uses the assets to manipulate the price of crypto on DeFi platforms. In the Hundred Finance hack, large loans were taken out under the falsified exchange rate.\nIn 2022, Hundred Finance also suffered an exploit on the Gnosis Chain. The protocol’s liquidity was drained through a reentrancy attack, resulting in a $6 million loss.\nRelated: Pike Finance clarifies ‘USDC vulnerability’ statement on $1.6M exploit\nWhile flash loan attacks have wreaked havoc within the space in the past few years, April 2024 showed a significant decrease in losses from this type of hack.\nAccording to a report from CertiK, flash loan attacks only accounted for $129,000 lost in April. Its largest single incident within the month only caused $55,000 in damages. CertiK said in the report that this was the lowest amount lost to flash loan attacks since February 2022.\nMeanwhile, losses to crypto hacks in general also decreased in April.

From a product perspective, or feature perspective, we have more features on-chain than you could really replicate in a centralized exchange.”\nDespite the greater diversity of applications on-chain, Warwick noted that crypto users were still utilizing centralized exchanges (CEXs) for crypto-related financial activity by a “significant margin.”\nHe explained that despite the flaws of CEXs being surfaced by events such as the collapse of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, crypto investors still didn’t make the leap into DeFi and instead opted to move to competitor exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.\nKain Warwick speaking at Pragma Sydney\nFor Warwick, the barriers preventing users from onboarding into DeFi couldn’t be traced back solely to products nor did it fall back to promises of increased safety. Instead, these onboarding issues were primarily rooted in issues with user experience.\nHe explained that Infinex would function as the “UX layer,” offering a more centralized exchange-like interface for users to engage with decentralized applications on a range of blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum and Solana.\n“It’s a really hard thing to do well, but I think we are at least getting pretty close on the Infinex side.”\nWarwick added that Infinex would utilize social passkeys to enable users to log in via Web2 applications — such as a Google account — and reduce the “friction” that typically accompanies a standard Web3 user experience.\n“The core component is you will have an account that you will own — it’s self-custodial — but you will be able to effectively login to that account via Web2,” Warwick said.\n“The starting point of [Infinex] you can have an account, and then you can deposit into that account to earn governance points,” said Warwick. He added there would be a points-farming game that would run for the month following the launch.\nOn March 13, Infinex suffered a security breach, which saw Warwick quickly take over as head of the project’s working group.\nSource: Infinex\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Warwick said the security vulnerability was “part of the reason” Infinex’s launch — initially targeted for Q4 2023 — was delayed.\nThe security vulnerability was a social engineering attack that saw hackers gain access to a password vault, Warwick said. From there, they were then able to get into the protocol’s DNS store and modify Infinex’s DNS.\nRelated: Synthetix DEX launch to join efforts reducing the ‘serious friction’ in DeFi\n“There were no funds at risk because we weren’t live — but just from learning a lesson sort of thing — even prior to being live, that just shouldn’t be able to happen,” he said.\n“I came in and I brought a couple of other people in and we burned all of the systems to the ground and rebuilt everything from scratch. It’s now one of the most secure environments I’ve ever worked in.”\nWarwick shared that the May 13 launch date is the proposed launch date that has been provided to Infinex’s governing DAO — the Infinex Council — which still needs to vote on-chain to approve the launch.\nHe said he was confident the council would approve — but the decision starts and ends with the council.\nFollowing Infinex’s launch, Warwick hopes to see it crack $50 million in total value locked and attract 10,000 genuine users within the first 30 days.\n“We have 200,000 people on the waitlist but a lot of those are sybils, airdrop farmers and bots. We do think there’s a solid 10,000 [genuine] users on that list,” he said.\n“If we have 5,000 to 10,000 people and 50 million of TVL — I feel like we’ve done something right.”\nWarwick added that if the current market cycle were to remain bullish, he expects to see “hundreds of thousands” of users join Infinex within a year of its launch.\nMagazine: Memecoins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?\nAdditional reporting by Felix Ng.\nUpdate (9:12 am UTC): This article has been updated to include further details of the Infinex platform. \nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.

With the aid of Ankr’s liquid staking service, Bitcoin can be staked through various Bitcoin restaking protocols.

FanSociety hopes to be the Web3 platform that makes this possible.","title":"FanSociety creator explains how NFTs can bring musicians and fans together","detailed_content":"Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, took the world by storm in 2019 — and then eroded to near rubble as the entire crypto market contracted and the industry fell into a nearly two-year-long bear market. An objective assessment of the NFT phenomena might conclude that the technology did deliver on a good deal of its promises, and instead of writing off the failed projects as scams, it might be more insightful to take a closer look at what features were needed to make projects successful. \nOn Episode 35 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Ray Salmond and Jonathan DeYoung spoke with Miles, a Web3 developer who is the creative mind behind FanSociety — a funding mechanism for musicians that borrows and blends ideas from traditional fan clubs of the 1950s with modern crowdfunding ideas and immutable storage on blockchain networks.\nTech should be adaptable and give users room to grow\nAny aspiring musician knows that securing funding for an album is difficult, and of course, once the album is out, locking in fans for life becomes the next hurdle. Miles explained that he envisions FanSociety being used as a tool for creators to connect with their audience, reward loyalty and grow in a way that is more organic than the typical NFT collections that currently exist.\nHe also explained that FanSociety has the dual purpose of allowing musicians to raise money from fans while also rewarding and retaining them by giving them digital artifacts as part of their expanding discography.\nAccording to Miles, a recurring issue with NFT collections is that projects often have fixed sizes and creators need to issue a new contract to “extend” the collection:\n“It doesn’t make sense to have a limit, you know, and kind of just have one smart contract. And, like I said, it’s like a boolean. You either have the token, you either have the NFT or you don’t. And a lot of what was going on as well was very successful musicians were launching NFT projects, and it was kind of that same situation where, you know, they’ve only got 10,000 NFTs available, and you either have one or you don’t. And to me, that’s very elitist and kind of antithetical to kind of the whole Web3 ethos, to me. And so I wanted to do something different.”\nRelated: NFT utility continues to captivate fashion and luxury brands — NFT Paris\nFan engagement should also have value\nRevenue sharing is another issue FanSociety aims to tackle. Miles lamented that popular streaming platforms and record labels only give creators a sliver of the revenue generated by their music and that platforms tend to absorb the bulk of tips that creators receive from fans:\n“You look at Twitch, for example. You tip somebody, you give them money, you subscribe to them. First of all, the platform takes 50% rev[enue] split, which is atrocious to me. And we don’t know if that’s going to go up in the future, right? The content creators on there don’t know if that’s going to go up to 60%, 70%, if they’re going to throw more fees on top of that. So there’s that kind of problem.”\nFor artists who will use the platform to expand their catalog and engage with fans, Miles said the NFTs can be a more meaningful show of appreciation than “a sticker pack to put in their chat” or something else that is kind of gimmicky and “not very valuable.”\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nMiles said:\n“I’d like to see more value being able to be given back to the supporters, and so that’s what I’m trying to support. And it’s up to the artist to decide what sorts of things, what sorts of ways they want to show their appreciation to people who support them.”\nTo hear more from Mile’s conversation with The Agenda — including his future plans for FanSociety — listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The approval of spot ETFs in the United States is also ushering in a new era of crypto adoption and putting a new emphasis on real-world assets (RWA).\nRWA tokens, which are essentially tokens with real-world representatives, promise to bridge crypto and TradFi, improving the liquidity, accessibility and efficiency of tokenized assets. Moving trade to the internet is estimated to generate $280 billion of savings annually, and RWA tokenization offers a blockchain-based solution to achieve this goal.\nAsset passport for borderless trading\nMattereum is a London-based RWA initiative founded by Vinay Gupta, who was also the Ethereum launch coordinator in 2015. The project’s system makes it possible to tokenize, fractionalize and trade real-world assets on-chain while providing a legal bond between the token and the asset in the real world.\nOperating as a legal hub for tokenized RWA developers, Mattereum’s legal tech solution creates a formal legal connection between an on-chain token and the physical asset it represents. It does so by issuing a Mattereum Asset Passport, which connects the token to the physical asset so that the owner of the token can be shown to legally own the respective RWA. The Asset Passport also provides money-back warranties on the accuracy of the information about an RWA (such as its description, authenticity and condition) that a buyer uses when making purchasing decisions.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nMattereum’s legal infrastructure is based on the United Kingdom’s common law provisions for digital commerce. Owing to the 1958 New York Convention on arbitration, the provisions are enforceable in more than 170 countries, legitimizing and making Asset Passports available for use in all of them.\nBy carrying RWAs on-chain, Mattereum facilitates access to real-world assets, expanding and globalizing their market. The legal services provided by Mattereum eliminate national borders in RWA trading, aligning with blockchain’s fundamental ethos, such as decentralization and borderlessness.\nMattereum concentrates on high-value assets like gold, real estate, and fine art, as well as assets that lag behind in digitalization compared to the likes of stocks and bonds. However, the solution is applicable to almost any asset class.\nMattereum offers full legal protection for RWA projects. Source: Mattereum\nThe platform presents users with options for both fractionalized and nonfungible tokenization. Users may opt to produce a complete digital twin by minting an ERC-721 token — the Ethereum standard for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) — or fractionalize the real-world asset by minting ERC-20 representatives.\nTokenizing gold and real estate\nFounded in 2017, Mattereum has been working to get smart contracts on blockchain as legally accepted contracts. The RWA project began offering services in 2021 by tokenizing Hollywood collectibles, such as props and merchandise from top-rated movies. It then moved onto gold and real estate.\nMattereum is now focusing on its token sale. Launched by Mattereum’s German subsidiary Mattereum GmbH, the Mattereum Discount Token’s (MATR) proceeds will be used to fund company expansion and development. The platform will also feature tokenized and fractionalized gold and real estate on-chain.\nCommenting on the gap Mattereum fills between blockchain and traditional assets, Vinay Gupta, the founder and CEO of Mattereum, said:\n“Mattereum is providing a key service for the new real-world asset ecosystem on the blockchain by providing the legal layer that connects tokens with assets so that their properties are confirmed by warranties and their ownership can be proved in court almost anywhere in the world. We are fully live and ready to provide these services today to other RWA companies in the space. This is vital for bringing world trade on-chain and has the potential to make Mattereum bigger than Visa.”\nThe MATR token is available for purchase through Mattereum GmbH’s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, Swarm. Buying MATR is subject to terms and conditions in eligible jurisdictions — in particular, residents of the United Kingdom and the United States are excluded from the public sale of MATR.\nCrypto’s resurgence will undoubtedly bring a new focus on RWAs, and Mattereum offers a comprehensive perspective on tokenization that prioritizes legality and compliance.\nFind out more about Mattereum\n#Blockchain\n#Law\n#Gold\n#Technology\n#Assets\n#Real Estate\n#Tokens\n#NFT\n#Regulation\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.

I’ve been there for over 20 years. This city’s given me everything: my business, my purpose. My two children were born here. I plan to be buried in the city,” said Rose. “So it’s my way of giving back.”\nRose, a fierce advocate for freedom of speech, conducts long-form interviews on his “Digital Freedom Platform,” drawing comparisons with major podcaster Joe Rogan. His guests cover topics such as politics, wellness, self-improvement and wealth. Many of Rose’s interview subjects hail from the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, informing his political outlook.\nRose told Cointelegraph that the current leadership of the United Kingdom isn’t doing enough to promote the crypto industry.\n“I really believe we could push London as a crypto-first city and bring in massive amounts of business and industry,” said Rose. “Unfortunately, we just don’t have that right now, and the prime minister is paying crypto a bunch of lip service.”\nIn 2022, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stated his intention to make the U.K. “a global hub for crypto asset technology,” but in 2024, evidence of progress toward this goal remains scant.\nRose argues that Sunak is not the only one underperforming. The entrepreneur also believes the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — which regulates cryptocurrency in the U.K. — is misfiring.\n“The FCA and the other organizations are literally pushing companies out, and that’s a shame,” said Rose.\nBlockchain use cases and London coin\nRose tells Cointelegraph that his association with Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency is longstanding.\nLondon Real regularly features high-profile names from the cryptocurrency world. The entrepreneur explains how he previously attracted big names to interview:\n“I started featuring the top 100 people in crypto, and they said ‘yes’ because I had two million YouTube subscribers. That’s probably the biggest channel they would ever be on,” he said.\n“I could have Michael Saylor, Raoul Pal, Yat Siu and most of the layer-1 founders — Justin Sun, Hedera Hashgraph, Avax — and they taught me about the blockchain.”\n“I had Max Keiser on my show in 2013 talking about Bitcoin. That’s when I bought my first Bitcoin and went down the rabbit hole. I would later have Andreas Antonopoulos on my show in 2015, ‘17 and ‘19. Some people call him the Bitcoin Jesus,” said Rose.\nRecent: DeFi bull market confounds expectations with RWAs and ‘recursive airdrops’\nRose is further pushing a policy agenda that is heavy on cryptocurrency and blockchain. One of his proposals to win over Londeners is the creation of a “London coin.”\nAccording to Rose, the token would put the equivalent of £100 into the hands of every London resident, sourcing liquidity from a tax on the traditional financial sector.\n“We want to inject it with 1 billion pounds of liquidity, with a one-off 1% tax from the banks, who make all of their money in the City of London and probably don’t pay anything back,” said Rose.\n“Then, what we would do is put that in the wallets and hands of every man, woman and child and use them to stake that for additional yields, allowing them to pay for public transport and other services with that and that alone. If we can make that work over the next 12 months, it could literally be copied by so many other cities.”\nRose added, “I want something super functional that’ll have DeFi practicalities in there as well. So that’s the plan for the London coin.”\nBlockchain for democracy\nFor Rose, blockchain goes beyond financial applications. The electoral hopeful also advocates using blockchain to secure the voting system, citing a 2005 Ipsos study that showed “two in five British voters are concerned about election fraud.”\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nWhile that study may be a little long in the tooth, more recent events in London are unlikely to have improved voter confidence. In 2015, Lutfur Rahman, the London mayor of the Tower Hamlets borough in East London, was found guilty of election fraud. Rahman was ordered to pay £250,000, and the election was re-run. Rahman was excluded from standing that year.\nIn March 2022, Communities Minister Kemi Badenoch wrote to the Metropolitan Police and the Electoral Commission, expressing concerns that voting fraud could occur again. In May 2022, Rahman was reelected to Tower Hamlets.\nRose sees a similar problem across the Atlantic, pointing to an erosion in voter trust after the last United States presidential elections.\n“After the 2020 elections, especially in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I heard a lot of people say there hasn’t been a fair election in that city for 100 years,” said Rose.\nIn an April 25 press release, Rose said blockchain “can help the electorate see and interrogate voting, as well as securing the electoral process, providing a permanent, accessible and reliable record.”\nRegarding London elections, Rose told Cointelegraph, “I’m not accusing anyone of election fraud, but I am saying that the job of London Elects is to make the British public confident that their vote matters.”\nLondon Elects is the body responsible for the mayoral elections in London.\nBrian Rose is running for mayor of London. Source: Brian Rose\nRun-ins with Ofcom and YouTube\nRose, the host of the longstanding London Real podcast, is not without critics or controversy.\nIn fact, much of Rose’s politics are intertwined with his podcast and the events surrounding its broadcast.\nIn 2020, during the U.K.’s COVID-19 lockdown, Rose broadcast an episode of London Real featuring professional conspiracy theorist David Icke. Icke is best known for popularizing the theory that the U.K. royal family are shapeshifting lizards from outer space (or another dimension).\nFree speech advocate Rose told Cointelegraph, “I don’t agree with everything that my guests say by any means, but I believe they have the right to say it.”\nIn 2020, Icke offered a number of conspiracies regarding COVID-19. On London Real, Icke blamed an electromagnetic “soup of radiation toxicity” for compromising the immune systems of the elderly and said a cult was using the virus to create an “Orwellian global state” enabled by artificial intelligence.\nThe U.K.’s communications regulator, Ofcom, received 48 complaints about the London Real broadcast.\n“We didn’t incite violence. We didn’t incite overthrows of governments. It was literally just two people talking. But I guess that was considered dangerous,” Rose said.\nOn the podcast, Rose resisted or outright disagreed with Icke’s theories.\n“I do believe in the science, and I do believe in vaccines,” he told Icke at the time.\nDespite this, Rose was censored, and the broadcast was removed from YouTube. Ofcom later ruled that the program “had the potential to cause significant harm to viewers in London during the Coronavirus crisis.”\nDigital Freedom Platform\nThe censorship of his YouTube channel set Rose on a path to creating the “Digital Freedom Platform,” a website that hosts London Real broadcasts. He no longer uploads to YouTube, telling Cointelegraph that he was permanently deplatformed eight months ago.\nRose’s followers crowdfunded the Digital Freedom Platform to the tune of $1 million. During the raise, Rose stated that $200,000 would be earmarked for the application of blockchain technology.\nCointelegraph asked Rose how that blockchain integration was progressing.\n“The problem is that putting video on the blockchain is still not doable,” Rose explained. “There are a couple of companies in Dubai right now that I’m talking to, but right now, from a bandwidth perspective, it’s just nearly impossible.”\nHe added, “I would love to do it because we continue to be censored.”\nIn an interview with PoliticsJoe in April 2021, Rose gave another reason for not implementing blockchain into the Digital Freedom Platform. He said he’d “already spent the money” on other aspects of the platform, including livestreams.\nRecent: US stablecoin bill to ‘cement’ dollar dominance, fight sanction evasion\nWhen Cointelegraph spoke with Rose, the broadcaster was in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, promoting his documentary film We Will Not Be Silenced. The documentary centers on the censorship of London Real in 2020 and stars David Icke, with whom Rose has fostered an ever-closer working relationship in recent years.\nAt the premiere, Rose said, “Before I was an advocate for free speech, but now I’m a fanatic [...] they chose the wrong white boy to f*ck with.”\nRose tells Cointelegraph he plans to spend the final few days of the campaign back in London, aiming to secure every last vote he can. Should the entrepreneur capture five percent of the vote or more, it would strengthen the case for Rose to be included in future televised mayoral debates — if he decided to stand again.\nLondon goes to the polls on May 2.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Markets Outlook newsletter\nGet critical insights to spot investment opportunities, mitigate risks, and refine your trading strategies.

This complexity limited the internet’s reach to tech experts with advanced technical knowledge.\nHowever, the release of Windows 95 revolutionized the landscape by introducing a user-friendly graphical user interface integrated with an internet browser. This significant shift enabled individuals without technical backgrounds to perform complex operations with simple clicks and drags.\nAs a result, the number of internet users surged dramatically from 14% of American adults in 1995 to 46% in five years. Today, the Web3 ecosystem is at a similar turning point, grappling with its own complexities that hinder wider user adoption.\nFrom Windows to intent-centric infrastructure\ndappOS, an intent execution network, aims to be the Windows 95 of Web3. With a recent $15.3 million Series A funding round led by Polychain, valuing the project at $300 million, dappOS aims to provide developers with the infrastructure to integrate intent-centric functionality, thus simplifying the blockchain user experience to a level akin to using an application as intuitive as TikTok.

On the other side, developers can leverage these services to fulfill user intents based on current network conditions and available service providers. Democratizing access to blockchain capabilities, dappOS’ structure optimizes the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of operations.\nOne of the standout innovations of dappOS is its Optimistic Minimum Staking mechanism. The system allows tasks to be executed immediately, with verification following completion.\nIf a task fails, the network reaches a consensus on penalizing the responsible service provider to ensure successful task completion or appropriate compensation for the users. This arrangement benefits service providers by requiring only a minimal stake, slightly above the total value of potential uncompleted tasks, and benefits users through enhanced efficiency and reduced costs.\nFurther strengthening the user-centric approach, dappOS has introduced several intent-centric frameworks, like the Unified Account and Intent Assets.\ndappOS’s intent-centric frameworks empower DApps with intent-centric functionality. Source: dappOS\nThe Unified Account seamlessly integrates across various blockchain networks, reminiscent of centralized exchange experiences, where users can effortlessly manage and use their assets without delving into technical complexities.\nIntent Assets, such as the intentUSD, function similarly to stablecoins but with added flexibility and automatic yield generation, addressing the common issues associated with liquidity and stability in the Web3 space. This innovative approach allows stablecoins to automatically transition between different forms in different scenarios. For example, intentUSD can function as Tether\nUSDT\n$1.00\nwhen USDT is required and can transform into USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\nfor USDC transactions.\nSimplifying DApp interactions for mainstream adoption\nMoreover, dappOS significantly refines the DApp interaction process by enabling real-time operations that can be completed with a single signature, eliminating the need for multiple intermediate steps typically associated with blockchain transactions. The improvement simplifies user interactions and meets blockchain technology’s stringent security and decentralization standards.\nThe implications of dappOS’ developments are profound, mirroring the transformative impact of Windows 95. Just as Windows 95 catalyzed the mass adoption of the internet, dappOS aims to do the same for Web3, potentially ushering in a new era of exponential growth and innovation in the blockchain space.\nAs more developers and users engage with the platform, dappOS is poised to become a central hub in the Web3 ecosystem, akin to how Windows 95 became a foundational technology of the internet age. Through its innovative design and strategic implementations, dappOS is simplifying the blockchain experience and setting the stage for a broader, more inclusive Web3 future.\nLearn more about dappOS\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Funding\n#Technology\n#Adoption\n#Windows\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

It allows one party to prove that another party is being truthful without revealing any concealed information. \nZK allows public blockchains to validate the existence of hidden data. With this, crypto users can confirm the legitimacy of information without disclosing its content.\nWhile the technology is still in its early beginnings, some believe it will have a similar impact as ChatGPT and gain similar waves of interest when it gets broader implementation.\nChatGPT moment for ZK\nIn a Cointelegraph interview at Token2049 in Dubai, Telos Foundation executive director John Lilic said there is no way to ignore ZK, as it is fundamental. Lilic described the technology as the “end game.”\nLilic believes that people won’t pay much attention to ZK soon because they find the concept hard to grasp. However, the executive is confident that there will come a time when ZK systems will garner the same level of attention as ChatGPT did when it was initially introduced. Lilic said:\n“Nobody’s going to care so much. And then, suddenly, everything all at once will come onto the networks that have the best ZK systems. You see how fast the ChatGPT thing came. Suddenly, it was everywhere. That’s how I think it’s going to go with ZK.”\nOn April 19, Telos Foundation partnered with Ponos Technology to develop a layer-2 network, leveraging Telos’ SNARKtor, a decentralized recursive proof aggregator. According to Lilic, the move was part of their efforts to become a “network of networks.”\nStill in its early stages\nWhile ZK systems have a lot to be excited about when it comes to the future, the ChatGPT moment for these technologies might not happen in the near future.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nRichard Meissner, the co-founder of Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), which utilizes ZK systems for cross-chain ownership proofs, said that ZK tech is still in its “early stages of development.”\nThe executive said that more optimization is still needed to encourage adoption. Meissner explained:\n“There has been interest in the tech and in the last couple of months, it was possible to see prototypes for all kinds of use cases based on ZK-proofs. For example, cross-chain ownership proofs for smart accounts.”\nMeanwhile, Terence Kwok, the founder of Humanity Protocol, which uses ZK systems within its ecosystem, described ZK’s current state as “promising and evolving.” Kwok expressed optimism toward ZK’s role in shaping a more secure, private and decentralized environments.\nKwok added that there are ongoing research and development efforts that aim to address ZK’s limitations and expand its applicability.\n“With innovations on the horizon, such as improved scalability and usability, ZK technology holds immense potential for further adoption across diverse domains,” Kwok added.\nWhy people should care about ZK\nMeissner pointed out that blockchains are transparent by principle. However, the executive also noted that publicly visible transactions may not be appropriate for all use cases.\nHe said that any interaction between two parties that may not fully trust each other might require ZK technology to “verify certain credentials without revealing sensitive details to enable trustless transactions.”\nRelated: Ernst \u0026 Young taps ZK-proofs on Ethereum to automate contracts\nMeanwhile, Lilic gave examples of why people should care about ZK technology. The executive said the basic idea is “proving that you know something without disclosing what it is.”\nLilic said that a potential use case for this technology lies in car rentals using a blockchain system with crypto payments integrated. The ZK director said that if people wanted to rent a car, a blockchain system might not be optimal if it would show a person’s identity documents to others.\n“You’re not going to use a blockchain system to rent that car if it means your license and your identity documents are on-chain forever for everyone to see. Okay? It’s just not worth it.”\nHowever, Lilic said that with ZK, people can simply go into the car rental shop and generate proof on their device that they have a valid license and meet the requirements for people who can drive a car.\n“And instead of giving them your license, you simply share proof that you have a license. And it’s valid. And these attributes are valid,” Lilic added.\nWeb3 scalability relies on ZK\nApart from these, Kwok recognized that ZK technology is crucial for Web3 as the industry continues to empower individuals with control over their personal information. Kwok said:\n“In a time where data breaches and privacy violations are all too common, ZK technology serves as a shield, allowing individuals to assert their identity and authenticate transactions without exposing sensitive details.”\nKwok believes that users should try to understand the concept behind ZK as it will allow them to make more informed decisions about the Web3 applications they use and share their data with.\nMagazine: 68% of Runes are in the red — Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.

The remaining allocation would be distributed to users in the following “seasons.”\n5% of EIGEN’s total supply would be distributed in Season One.

Basically makes 1000-2000 Eigen stakers happy at the expense of 100k who will get peanuts,” shared one user on X.\nHowever, EigenLayer is not the first protocol to leverage a linear model for token distribution, with several major protocols, including Solana-based protocols Kamino Finance and Parcl, opting for the same distribution model in their respective airdrops last month, though that didn\u0027t appear to attract the same level of criticism at the time. \nAnother major concern for critics was the harsh geographic restrictions placed on users looking to claim their airdrops.\nAccording to EigenLayer’s legal documentation, users from 30 countries including the United States, Canada, China, and Russia would not be able to claim EIGEN tokens.\nSource: BoneCondor\nThe foundation noted they had taken extra steps to ensure that users trying to skirt these restrictions with VPNs wouldn’t be able to do so.\n“Accepting stake from those countries and not rewarding them isn’t right.

What they don’t agree on is how. This is the “modular” versus “monolithic” discussion unfolding across the industry, and it’s one of the most interesting — and sometimes contentious — debates.\nModular scaling calls for moving small-value transactions to a tiered system of layer-2s and even layer-3s that eventually settle to a base chain. This approach, which has been embraced by the Ethereum (ETH) community, has a major drawback: it leads to network fragmentation and an inferior user experience.\nMonolithic scaling — best exemplified by Solana (SOL) — calls for keeping all transactions on the same chain and optimizing the network with hardware, software, and consensus upgrades to give it greater throughput. The primary benefit of this approach is a better user experience. The main downside is that it can’t possibly work, not without sacrificing the very features that make a blockchain appealing in the first place: decentralization and resilience.\nRelated: The Runes protocol will ignite a new season for Bitcoin after the halving\nProponents of the monolithic approach often misunderstand the fundamental service that a permissionless chain offers. It’s not transaction processing — that’s what centralized networks do. Decentralized networks provide a scarce asset called secure blockspace. Think of it as fuel, but for a decentralized economy. Like all scarce assets, secure blockspace has a limited supply. But demand fluctuates, so the ultimate arbiter of who gets to use it is price.\nThere’s an old joke in commodities that “the best cure for high oil prices is high oil prices.” Higher prices can potentially lead to higher supply in the long run — although there isn’t always more product to pull out of the ground. More importantly, higher prices are guaranteed to reduce demand now. They force everyone to use the commodity more efficiently and price out smaller users altogether.\nSolana\u0027s network crashed most recently in February. Source: X\nThat might seem unfair, but the goal is efficiency, not fairness. The alternative is for a third party like the government to either ration fuel or subsidize it. Neither works as intended. Rationing leads to long lines, subsidies lead to waste. Think: kids going on a joyride vs a factory that can’t operate.\nWelcome to the current state of Solana. The monolithic chain experienced spiking demand during the memecoin mania in recent months, leading to high transaction failure rates. Users adopted by trying to submit their transactions over and over, exacerbating the problem. Solana doesn’t have a network mempool, but it now has a de facto queue.\nUsers have been getting upset about Solana\u0027s outages for years. Source: X\nThis is what you’d expect to happen if secure blockspace is priced too cheaply.\nModular chains provide different tiers of secure block space for different users — $20 to transact on ETH but only 2 cents to use Arbitrum. But Solana wants to give a $1 trade as much security as a $1 million transfer — even though the $1 trade, like the kids going on a joyride, doesn’t need it.\nRelated: Bitcoin\u0027s halving won\u0027t see a 600% return this year — so adjust your strategy\nTo be fair, one of the upgrades Solana developers are working on are better fee markets that are more responsive to demand. But if these upgrades work then smaller traders will simply be priced out in peak times. Unlike a modular chain, they won’t have anywhere else to go.\nThe other solution developers are working on are ways of scaling the network with upgraded software and faster hardware. What they don’t realize is that doing so will just invite more small value transfers — there is no limit to demand if you price a scarce good cheap enough. Back when the Soviet Union used to subsidize bread, people would feed it to their animals.\nMeanwhile, the core network infrastructure becomes more centralized and less stable. A chain that is optimized to run at peak performance at all times is more likely to go down, as Solana has periodically.\nThe intentions of the monolithic approach to scaling may be commendable, but the outcomes aren’t — not if we value decentralization and resilience.\nOmid Malekan is an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and the author of Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets, and Platforms.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Blockchain rollups provide quicker processing by acting as a self-checkout lane. To reduce network congestion, they group transactions and manage them off the main blockchain. This reduces the cost per transaction and expedites the process. \nFinally, for security purposes, a single transaction summary — which resembles a receipt for each self-checkout customer — is sent back to the main blockchain. This allows for faster and less expensive side transactions while maintaining the security of the main system. Rollups accomplish this in a variety of ways, but their main goal is to simplify blockchain transactions without sacrificing security.\nTypes of blockchain rollups\nZK-rollups and optimistic rollups are the two primary types of rollups. Both kinds of rollups ease mainnet congestion, resulting in speedier and less expensive transactions. \nZero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups)\nZK-rollups condense transaction data into a succinct proof using zero-knowledge proofs, which is subsequently sent to the main chain. ZK-rollups accomplish this by lowering the quantity of data that must be processed on-chain while preserving transaction security. \nZero-knowledge proofs ensure privacy by enabling validators to confirm the accuracy of the transactions without requiring access to the transaction details.\nOptimistic rollups\nAs implied by the name, optimistic rollups operate under the premise that all transactions are legitimate unless demonstrated to be otherwise.\nOptimistic rollups only submit the result to the main chain after processing transactions off-chain. The primary chain employs a fraud-proof technique to confirm the legitimacy of the transactions. The transactions are approved if there is no evidence of fraud, but if fraud is detected, the fraudulent transactions are rolled back. \nHow do blockchain rollups work?\nBefore uploading several transactions to the main blockchain, blockchain rollups process and bundle them off-chain. Here’s a step-by-step process of how blockchain rollups work:\nOff-chain processing\nFirstly, a rollup smart contract processes transactions off-chain. This enables faster and more efficient transaction processing than dealing directly with the main blockchain.\nTransaction bundling\nThe rollup smart contract groups several transactions into a single batch. This bundling procedure reduces the amount of data that needs to be uploaded to the main blockchain.\nValidation and compression (for ZK-rollups)\nZero-knowledge proofs are used in ZK-rollups to condense transaction data into a brief proof. After being created off-chain, this proof is added to the primary blockchain.\nSubmission to the main blockchain\nThe rollup smart contract uploads the transaction batch or the compressed proof to the main blockchain after the transactions have been processed and bundled.\nVerification and settlement\nThe batch or proof that has been uploaded gets validated on the main blockchain. A fraud-proof technique is used to verify the legitimacy of transactions for optimistic rollups. The transactions are finalized on the main blockchain if no fraud is found.\nApplications of rollups\nRollups can help improve the scalability of blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), gaming and virtual worlds and supply chain businesses.\nAmong the important applications of rollups are:\nScalability solutions\nRollups process and bundle several transactions off-chain before submitting them to the main blockchain, which greatly increases the scalability of blockchain networks. This lowers transaction fees and congestion by enabling a larger transaction throughput.\nDecentralized finance\nIn the DeFi space, where large transaction volumes can cause congestion and expensive gas costs, rollups are very helpful. DeFi applications may be made much more scalable and user-friendly by using rollups, which makes transactions faster and more economical.\nNonfungible tokens\nNFT platforms can benefit from rollups by minting and processing NFTs off-chain before submitting them to the main blockchain. This lowers the time and expense involved in generating and trading NFTs.\nGaming and virtual worlds\nRollups facilitate faster and more effective in-game transactions, asset transfers and decentralized governance, all of which can enhance the scalability of blockchain-based virtual worlds and gaming.\nSupply chain management\nRollups enhance security, efficiency and transparency in the supply chain by tracking and validating transactions.\nRollups, in general, provide a flexible scaling option that can help a variety of blockchain applications by allowing them to manage increased transaction volumes without compromising the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain network.\nBenefits of blockchain rollups\nBlockchain networks can benefit from rollups in multiple ways, including scalability, low transaction fees, faster transaction processing, enhanced privacy and user experience.\nRollups greatly increase scalability by processing and grouping several transactions off-chain before sending them to the main blockchain. This allows blockchain networks to manage a higher volume of transactions.\nMoreover, rollups lessen congestion on the main blockchain, which lowers transaction fees. This increases user accessibility and affordability for blockchain transactions. By shifting a large portion of the computation off-chain, rollups allow for speedier transaction processing. This leads to enhanced user experience and faster confirmation times.\nZero-knowledge proofs are used by some rollup solutions, such ZK-rollups, to ensure transaction privacy. This preserves the security and integrity of the blockchain network while helping to protect user data and transaction details.\nFurthermore, by resolving the scalability issues that blockchain networks encounter, rollups provide an effective and intuitive user experience. This makes them appropriate for a variety of applications, including supply chain management, gaming, and DeFi and NFTs.\nFuture of blockchain rollups\nBlockchain rollups appear to have a bright future, as these scaling solutions are expected to have a major impact on advancing blockchain technology. \nRollups present a practical way to increase network capacity, lower transaction costs and improve user experience as blockchain networks expand and encounter scalability issues. Furthermore, rollups are expected to play a bigger role in the DeFi space, where gas fees and large transaction volumes have proven to be major obstacles.\nRollups’ connectivity with Ethereum and other major blockchain platforms is a crucial component of their future. Rollups are likely to be essential in improving the network’s scalability as Ethereum incorporates danksharding. \nThere will likely be more innovation in this field, such as advancements in security, privacy and interoperability as rollup technology matures. Though rollup systems like ZK-rollups and optimistic rollups are already becoming popular, new advancements could result in rollup solutions that are even more effective and scalable.

Malicious users exploited exposed user ID tokens to execute a system query language (SQL) injection attack, which led to unauthorized changes in device metadata within the graphics processing unit (GPU) network.\nHusky.io, Io.net’s chief security officer, responded promptly with remedial actions and security upgrades to protect the network. Fortunately, the attack did not compromise the GPUs’ actual hardware, which remains secure due to robust permission layers.\nThe breach was detected during a surge in write operations to the GPU metadata application programming interface (API), triggering alerts at 1:05 am Pacific Standard Time on April 25.\nIn response, security measures were reinforced by implementing SQL injection checks on APIs and enhancing the logging of unauthorized attempts. Additionally, a user-specific authentication solution using Auth0 with OKTA was swiftly deployed to address vulnerabilities related to universal authorization tokens.\nSource: Hushky.io\nUnfortunately, this security update coincided with a snapshot of the rewards program, exacerbating an expected decrease in supply-side participants. Consequently, legitimate GPUs that did not restart and update could not access the uptime API, causing a significant drop in active GPU connections from 600,000 to 10,000.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nTo address these challenges, Ignition Rewards Season 2 has been initiated in May to encourage supply-side participation. Ongoing efforts include collaborating with suppliers to upgrade, restart, and reconnect devices to the network.\nThe breach stemmed from vulnerabilities introduced while implementing a proof-of-work mechanism to identify counterfeit GPUs. Aggressive security patches before the incident prompted an escalation in attack methods, necessitating continuous security reviews and improvements.\nRelated: AI has a hardware crisis: Here’s how decentralized cloud can fix it\nThe attackers exploited a vulnerability in an API to display content in the input/output explorer, inadvertently revealing user IDs when searching by device IDs. Malicious actors compiled this leaked information into a database weeks before the breach.\nThe attackers leveraged a valid universal authentication token to access the “worker-API,” enabling changes to device metadata without requiring user-level authentication.\nHusky.io emphasized ongoing thorough reviews and penetration tests on public endpoints to detect and neutralize threats early. Despite challenges, efforts are underway to incentivize supply-side participation and restore network connections, ensuring the platform’s integrity while serving tens of thousands of compute hours per month.\nIo.net planned to integrate Apple silicon chip hardware in March to enhance its artificial intelligence and machine learning services.\nMagazine: Real AI use cases in crypto: Crypto-based AI markets, and AI financial analysis","tags":["#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Security","#Hacks"],"author":"by Amaka Nwaokocha","creation_date":"2024-04-28"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-liquid-staking-and-how-does-it-work","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Liquid staking reduces the minimum threshold required to earn block rewards and simultaneously enables the tokenized representation of staked assets.","title":"What is liquid staking, and how does it work?","detailed_content":"Liquid staking, explained\nLiquid staking allows stakers to keep the liquidity of their staked tokens by using a stand-in token that they can use to earn additional yield through DeFi protocols.\nBefore diving into liquid staking, let’s understand staking and the problems associated with it. Staking refers to the process of locking up a cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to sustain it, and it enables the stakers to earn a profit. However, staked assets typically become illiquid during the staking period, as they can’t be exchanged or transferred.\nLiquid staking enables cryptocurrency holders to take part in staking without giving up control over their holdings. This has transformed the way users approach staking. Projects such as Lido introduced liquid staking, offering a tokenized representation of staked assets in the form of tokens and derivatives. \nIt allows users to reap the advantages of staking while also retaining the flexibility to trade, trading these tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or transferring them to other users.\nIs there a difference between delegated staking and liquid staking?\nNetwork users in delegated proof-of-take (DPoS) cast votes to select the delegate of their preference. The purpose of liquid staking, however, is to let stakers circumvent the mechanism of minimum staking threshold and locked tokens.\nThough DPoS borrows its basic concepts from proof-of-stake, its execution is different. In DPoS, network users are empowered to elect delegates, called “witnesses” or “block producers” for block validation. The number of delegates participating in the consensus process is limited and can be adjusted through voting. Network users in DPoS can pool their tokens into a staking pool and use their combined voting power to vote for the preferred delegate.\nLiquid staking, on the other hand, is designed to bring down the threshold for investing and provide a way for stakers to circumvent the mechanism of locked tokens. Blockchains often have minimum requirements for staking. Ethereum, for instance, requires anyone who wants to set up a validator node to stake 32 Ether (ETH) minimum. It also requires specific computer hardware, software, time and expertise, which again requires plenty of investment.\nWhat is staking-as-a-service?\nStaking-as-a-service is a platform that serves as a mediator, connecting a blockchain’s consensus mechanism with cryptocurrency holders who want to contribute to the functioning of the network. \nStaking-as-a-service is a platform or service that enables users to delegate their crypto assets to a third party, who then participates in staking on the users’ behalf, usually in exchange for a fee or a share of the rewards. JP Morgan notes that by 2025, the staking services sector will expand to a whopping $40 billion. Crypto staking services will play a large role in this emerging economy, and liquid staking will be an integral part of it.\nStaking-as-a-service platforms can be categorized as custodial and noncustodial based on their level of decentralization, which plays a major role in safeguarding stakeholders’ best interests and maintaining transparency. To facilitate decentralized governance, key decisions are made by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). \nCustodial staking-as-a-service involves extensive management of the staking process. Staking services offered by crypto exchanges are custodial. Rewards first go to the staking provider before being distributed among stakers.\nIn the noncustodial staking-as-a-service model, a validator charges a commission to anyone who wants to participate in staking. In PoS networks that support native delegation, the staker’s share of rewards is directly sent to them, with no involvement from the validator. \nHow liquid staking functions\nLiquid staking is designed to eliminate the threshold of staking and enable holders to make profits with liquid tokens.\nStaking pools allow users to consolidate several small stakes into a large one using a smart contract, which gives corresponding liquid tokens (representing their share of the pool) to each staker.\nThe mechanism eliminates the threshold of becoming a staker. Liquid staking takes it a step further and enables stakers to make double earnings. On the one hand, they earn from the staked tokens, and on the other hand, they make profits with liquid tokens by carrying out financial activities such as trading, lending or any other activity without impacting their original staked position.\nUsing Lido as a case study will help us understand better how liquid staking functions. Lido is a liquid staking solution for PoS currencies, which supports several PoS blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Kusama, Polkadot and Polygon. Lido provides an innovative solution to the hurdles presented by traditional PoS staking by effectively lowering barriers to entry and the costs associated with locking up one’s assets in a single protocol.\nLido is a smart contract-based staking pool. Users who deposit their assets with the platform are staked on the Lido blockchain via the protocol. Lido allows ETH holders to stake fractions of the minimum threshold (32 ETH) to earn block rewards. Upon depositing funds into Lido’s staking pool smart contract, users receive Lido Staked ETH (stETH), an ERC-20 compatible token, which is minted upon deposit and burned upon withdrawal.\nThe protocol distributes the staked ETH to validators (node operators) within the Lido network, and subsequently, it is deposited to the Ethereum Beacon Chain for validation. These funds are then safeguarded in a smart contract, which is inaccessible to validators. The ETH deposited via the Lido staking protocol is segregated into sets of 32 ETH among active node operators on the network.\nThese operators utilize a public validation key to validate transactions involving users’ staked assets. This mechanism allows users’ staked assets to be distributed across multiple validators, mitigating risks linked to single points of failure and single validator staking. \nStakers who deposit Solana’s (SOL) token, Polygon (MATIC), Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama KSM with a set of smart contracts in Lido receive stSOL, stMATIC, stDOT and stKSM, respectively. The stTokens can be used for DeFi yield earning, providing liquidity, trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and many other use cases.\nAre there any risks associated with liquid staking platforms?\nLike any product or service in the crypto space, technical threats and market volatility need to be taken into account when dealing with liquid staking.\nTechnical threats\nPoS blockchains are still relatively new, and there is always the possibility of protocol bugs or vulnerabilities leading to asset loss or exploitation. Reliance on validators for staking also introduces counterparty risks.\nMarket risks\nLiquid staking unlocks the staked assets, enabling stakers to earn rewards from DeFi applications. However, this also opens up the risk of losing on two fronts in a market downturn.\nKeeping a liquid staking platform open-sourced and regularly audited helps protect against threats to an extent. Having a bounty program for the platform also helps minimize bugs. \nConducting comprehensive due diligence is crucial to combat the risks associated with market volatility. This involves researching historical market data, evaluating the financial health of potential investments, understanding the regulatory landscape and developing a diversified investment strategy.","tags":[],"author":"by Dilip Kumar Patairya","creation_date":"2024-04-27"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/liquid-staking-bnb-smart-chain-millions-stuck-defi-bridge-contracts-finance-redefined","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Arkham Research notified DeFi wallet owners to look at the addresses and try to retrieve their funds, which have been stuck for months in bridge contracts.","title":"Liquid staking on BNB Smart Chain, millions stuck in DeFi bridge contracts: Finance Redefined","detailed_content":"Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week.\nThe past week in DeFi saw BNB Chain announce native liquid staking on its BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

Source: McKinsey \u0026 Company\nDespite its massive potential, metaverse lacks a unified landscape to offer users a friendly experience. Over 160 companies are building their own metaverses across different blockchains and layers, and the lack of interoperability between networks creates a highly fragmented landscape for the metaverse.\nCreators and developers are shackled by fragmentation\nAs it stands, the metaverse is divided into myriad separate, incompatible worlds — each functioning as its own closed ecosystem. This segmentation stifles the flow of innovation from the developers’ side while confining users and creators within the boundaries of individual platforms. Key assets like nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 game elements are locked within these siloed environments.\nThe consequences of this fragmentation extend beyond creative limitations, imposing substantial financial burdens on those who wish to build and offer experiences within the metaverse. Developing these digital landscapes and interactions requires a hefty investment, yet the primary financial benefits disproportionately favor platform holders rather than creators.\nAs the metaverse continues to evolve, the necessity for a framework that supports seamless interconnectivity and empowers creators becomes increasingly evident, suggesting a pivotal area for innovation and collaboration in the digital frontier.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

The omnichain protocol enables creators to participate in a decentralized economic structure where accrued value benefits the actual innovators, incentivizing the development of new use cases while opening the door for community-driven governance.\nSomnia helps users recompose or remix content and build on previous creations to make metaverse accessible to a broader audience. The project’s approach makes hefty projects like organizing a new metaverse event more affordable by enabling the reuse of components from previous events, such as stages, light shows or firework displays. The original creators of the used components can earn royalties through microtransactions, rewarding all stakeholders in true Web3 fashion.\nUpgrading NFTs for metaverse\nSince NFTs were born in a two-dimensional environment, many ultra-popular collections were not in the metaverse conversation besides standing as static profile pictures. Somnia addresses this by “upgrading” 2D NFTs to metaverse-friendly 3D objects. It allows NFT collectors to explore the metaverse as their favorite NFT character, potentially opening up the way for Pudgy Penguins and Cool Cats running around in a unified virtual space. Developers can also design metaverse themes based on ultra-popular NFT collections.\nSomnia hosts a metaverse browser to offer an interconnected experience for users.\nSomnia launched its betanet on Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet while developing an EVM L1 for millions of users. During the betanet phase, users can bring their digital identities into the Somnia Protocol by creating personalized avatars through a collaboration with Avaturn.

The team estimates that smart contract exploits alone resulted in losses of over $5.4 billion between 2022 and 2023. Manche said:\n“Move eliminates reentrancy vulnerabilities by ensuring resources are uniquely accessed, preventing recursive exploits. It also ensures that transactions are completed before another can start, blocking approximately as much as 90% of attack vectors found in Solidity.”\nThe team launched M2, a Move VM-based layer-2 for Ethereum, in November 2023, which introduces an execution environment designed for more than 30,000 transactions per second (TPS).\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

Mei told Cointelegraph:\n“Decentralized AI attempts to address the existential flaws in AI, ensuring a more unbiased and safer AI.”\nThe key benefits of blockchain-based decentralized AI include more transparent decision-making, enhanced data privacy, and user-owned models that enable people to contribute their data or computing resources in exchange for token incentives, explained the founder.\nSome of the most popular centralized AI models produced significant inaccuracies and social media outrage in the past. Back in February, Google pulled its AI image generator after it produced historically inaccurate and “woke” images, causing widespread concerns over the application’s decision-making process.\nDecentralized AI will be key in addressing similar biased output, as seen with Gemini AI, by creating a more transparent decision-making process for the algorithms, Mei told Cointelegraph:\n“Centralized AI amplifies pre-existing power imbalances, privacy concerns and biases at an unprecedented pace, as exemplified by the Google Gemini AI incident where the AI depicted U.S. founding fathers as people of color, possibly as an overcorrection to long-standing racial bias problems in AI.”\nRelated: Google to fix diversity-borked Gemini AI, ChatGPT goes insane: AI Eye\n Blockchain-based, decentralized AI protocols offer transparency to verify the data provenance of the AI output, which is crucial for improving the algorithms, as the AI is only as good as the data it is trained on.

Established in 2019, Phemex distinguishes itself in the crowded market of crypto exchanges by addressing the specific needs of traders with a daily trading volume of approximately $2 billion across more than 300 trading pairs.\nPhemex has been making a splash in the crypto world with its pledge to become a hybrid exchange, embracing decentralization in its core processes. Just earlier this year, the dynamic exchange rolled out Pulse, its SocialFi platform, creating a one-stop hub where traders can seamlessly merge their social interactions and trading activities, all while earning rewards for their engagement.\nIn this interview, Phemex chief operating officer and co-founder of Pulse Stella Chan discusses the exchange’s recent initiatives, including their presence at the Token 2049 event in Dubai, its newly launched lending protocol, Pulse season 3 and the new avenues they are exploring to enrich their user engagement and platform capabilities.\nCointelegraph: Phemex recently attended the Token 2049 event in Dubai. Could you give us a recap of the event and the atmosphere?\nStella Chan: Token 2049 was an outstanding success, and I’m thrilled to report that our Phemex events truly made a splash, drawing attention from attendees worldwide. I am glad that the Cointelegraph team joined us and shared in the excitement as well. Our lineup of activities was in full force, featuring an exclusive night that united the crypto community, a compelling keynote delivered by the Phemex CEO and our interactive booth where participants engaged directly with the Phemex team.\nA standout moment was the reveal of our Phemex Lending Protocol, which allows users to borrow crypto at rock bottom rates without incurring extra fees and offers them the chance to also earn interest by supplying their assets. Lending allows traders to amplify their capital in the crypto space, enabling them to maximize opportunities in the current market cycle. We’ve developed a comprehensive solution for borrowing and lending. As the response at Token 2049 confirmed, it perfectly aligns with traders’ needs and is anchored by an exchange they trust and prefer for their trading activities.\nCT: As a cryptocurrency exchange, how does Phemex stay up-to-date with Web3 innovation and user demand?\nSC: The cryptocurrency domain is racing forward at a pace never seen before, going well beyond its initial conception as a mere digital substitute for physical currencies. This digital ecosystem is not limited to financial transactions; it includes a broad array of applications and services, from entertainment and social interaction to the comprehensive realm of decentralized finance (DeFi).\nPhemex has embraced this age of increased connectivity and user agency by adopting a hybrid model, blending the best of central exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) into our operations. The rollout of our Web3 ecosystem Phemexia last year stands as a landmark move in this evolution.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThis tactical transformation is geared toward granting users more control over their financial engagements and social interactions, which are increasingly intertwined, all while upholding the security and reliability synonymous with Phemex.\nWe are now introducing our hybrid stack within this ecosystem, fusing the autonomy of an on-chain experience with the trusted performance of centralized execution, beginning with the launch of the Phemex Lending Protocol.\nCT: What are the specific benefits that users will enjoy from Phemex Lending Protocol?\nSC: The Phemex Lending Protocol offers the lowest borrowing rates in the market and is free of any extra fees or additional charges. It also features a competitive and transparent loan-to-value ratio. To kick-start this protocol, we’re allocating $22 million in liquidity for our users’ benefit.\nSource: Phemex\nThey can leverage their holdings to secure loans without selling their assets, taking advantage of some of the market’s most favorable borrowing conditions with annual percentage yields (APYs) for borrowing as low as 3.57% currently, a stark contrast to the double-digit rates found on other platforms. We also ensure that users maintain full control over their funds, with the flexibility to withdraw and reallocate as they see fit.\nFurthermore, users have the option to contribute to our lending pools in return for an attractive APY that serves as a reliable source of passive income. This end-to-end solution allows users to benefit from excellent borrowing rates while simultaneously earning real-time annual percentage rate (APR) by providing liquidity with their assets.\nCT: How does the Phemex Lending Protocol integrate into the broader Phemexia Web3 ecosystem?\nSC: Phemex Lending Protocol is a cornerstone of the hybrid stack within our evolving Web3 ecosystem, marking the debut of our comprehensive suite of services. Our offerings are interconnected, creating a seamless end-to-end ecosystem. For vePT holders, the Phemex Lending Protocol offers an exclusive 30% discount on borrowing rates, underscoring our commitment to rewarding the loyalty of our expanding Web3 community. It’s another step toward integrating DeFi mainstays such as borrowing and lending services into our own highly efficient ecosystem while maintaining trust and transparency.\nCT: Why did you choose to focus on the borrowing and lending aspect of the crypto markets within the Phemexia ecosystem?\nSC: We’ve rolled out our hybrid DeFi stack with the Phemex Lending Protocol recognizing the user appetite for diverse financial products. Users crave the autonomy to manage their assets through DeFi integrations without sacrificing the smooth user experience offered by centralized platforms.\nOur recent upgrades to the Lending Protocol now allow users to supply liquidity and, in turn, earn the potential for significant interest returns. While such functionality is common in the DeFi space, Phemex sets itself apart as a hybrid exchange by integrating the best features of both worlds. Our users enjoy the sovereignty over their assets that DeFi provides, bolstered by additional security protocols designed to reduce the risks related to smart contract vulnerabilities and unpredictable fluctuations in borrowing rates.\nBy prioritizing borrowing and lending, we offer a comprehensive solution to meet the increasing user demand, excelling in what we do best — creating an inclusive financial ecosystem that delivers a frictionless experience for our users.\nCT: You’ve also recently launched Pulse, quickly gaining popularity among users. What exciting features can traders look forward to in Season 3 of Pulse?\nWe are diligently refining Pulse, our SocialFi platform, by incorporating user feedback to enhance its core service.\nThis season, we are boosting the daily prize pool to 10,000 PT and rolling out new features like “cast” and “tip” to encourage and reward high-quality content. Cast refers to the content posted on Pulse, while Tip is an interactive method to reward exceptional casts. The tipping feature allows you to acknowledge and incentivize the content creators whose insights significantly benefit our community. The greater the number of tips your Casts receive and the more you tip high-quality Casts, the more crypto rewards you’ll reap. Pulse is evolving into a space where trading meets with trending topics, and we’re delighted to facilitate this convergence.\nWe’re committed to fostering a vibrant community where quality engagement is acknowledged and rewarded, so I advise all crypto enthusiasts to stay tuned for Pulse updates.\nCT: What future developments can users expect from Phemex?\nSC: Beyond our current lending offerings, we’re excited about the diverse range of products awaiting launch. Topping our agenda is the automated market maker (AMM) protocol, designed to empower users to contribute to our exchange’s liquidity and reap the benefits of passive earnings. We are also laying the groundwork for an on-chain credit scoring mechanism, underpinned by our soulbound token, to revolutionize the way users access decentralized finance. Of course, we are dedicated to continually enhancing Pulse based on the valuable feedback from our community. We have a full schedule ahead at Phemex, and our team is devoted to providing the finest trading experience to all our users.\nLearn more about Phemex\n#Blockchain\n#Cryptocurrency Exchange\n#Lending\n#DeFi\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

However, two decades of digitization have shown that preparing and distributing content in a digital format is not enough to lower the barriers to scholarly information.\nPeer review, a vital process to ensure the quality and accuracy of published academic work, is still notoriously inefficient. The slow and opaque processes lead to delays in publishing new research. On top of that, most researchers from smaller institutions or developing countries have to face an uphill battle in gaining visibility and accessing mainstream scientific platforms.\nDue to the heavily centralized nature of such platforms, maintaining control and rights over one’s scientific data and findings becomes another challenge for most researchers. All in all, these challenges lead to a slower pace of scientific advancement and collaboration, often discouraging researchers and limiting the diversity of contributions in the scientific community.\nBlockchain technology can potentially improve various processes of scientific publishing, offering a solution to key challenges across the board. The immutability, transparency and global availability of blockchain present an opportunity for science circles to take a major step toward decentralization while giving power and governance to users and researchers.\nStepping into decentralized science\nNobleBlocks is a blockchain-based decentralized science (DeSci) platform that promises to address critical pain points in scientific publishing. Built on the Internet Computer Protocol, a blockchain infrastructure known for its speed and scalability, NobleBlocks offers high-speed and transparent transactions to minimize the time and complexity typically associated with publishing scientific research.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nKey to NobleBlocks’ mission of incentivizing scientific contribution is NOBL, the platform’s native token, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain. NobleBlocks uses its custom ckNOBL solution to integrate the Ethereum-based NOBL with the Internet Computer blockchain, enhancing the decentralization aspect of the DeSci platform and ensuring a seamless and secure connection between two robust blockchain ecosystems.\nThe tokenization of scientific efforts enables DeSci to acknowledge and reward every contributor — from editor to reviewer — in a fair model. As a globally accessible portal, NobleBlocks allows researchers to expand their projects’ horizons through partnerships with international researchers.\nMaking scientific work efficient and accessible\nNobleBlocks provides a streamlined system on blockchain that significantly reduces the time from research submission to publication, fixing inefficient peer review processes.\nThe platform democratizes access to essential research material globally by offering all researchers an open and easy-to-access platform. NobleBlocks also establishes data sovereignty and the integrity of scientific work by allowing researchers to retain control over their intellectual property — a crucial factor in encouraging original and diverse scientific contributions.\nPublications and contributions can be seen from the dashboard. Source: NobleBlocks\nIntegrating the decentralized nature of blockchain with conventional scientific publishing practices is no easy task. To achieve it, NobleBlocks harmonized the rigors of academic peer review with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain. The resulting solution has enabled the preservation of the integrity of the scientific process while opening doors to faster, more equitable access to research.\nAs a fully on-chain platform, NobleBlocks ensures complete transparency and immutability of scientific data and publications. Being fully on-chain allows every transaction, submission and review process to be recorded on the blockchain, offering enhanced security and trust in the hosted academic content.\nA platform for science communities\nAside from providing a platform for publishing and reviewing scientific work, NobleBlocks also builds a network to connect researchers, academicians and thought leaders from diverse disciplines and geographies.

Central to these challenges is the lack of transparency, security and individual control over personal data. In the existing paradigm, large organizations often collect and store vast amounts of personal data, sometimes exploiting the data for commercial gains without explicit user consent or fair compensation to the data owners. This is especially true when explored through the lens of the explosive growth of AI, where centralized organizations use our data without explicit consent to train and deploy AI systems.\nData breaches are also increasingly common, exposing sensitive personal information and leading to potential financial and reputational damage for individuals. The centralized nature of data storage systems often makes them attractive targets for cyberattacks. Additionally, the current systems lack sufficient mechanisms for individuals to verify where and how their data is being used, leading to mistrust and reluctance to share data.\nAre you aware of all the ways companies are collecting your personal data on a daily basis?\n\nWatch our latest video to find out more 👇🔥\n\n#dataprivacy #cookies pic.twitter.com/ahDyZafhzM\n— Itheum (@itheum) January 13, 2023\nThere is a clear need for solutions that enhance data security, provide greater transparency in data transactions and empower individuals with control over their data. Such solutions should ensure that individuals can monitor and regulate access to their data and receive adequate compensation when their data is used commercially.\nImproving user control over data can lead to a more equitable data ecosystem where privacy is respected and data exchanges are conducted fairly and transparently. This approach would protect individuals and build trust, encouraging more open and beneficial data sharing across platforms.\nThe blockchain impact on data ownership\nBlockchain and Web3 technologies address several of these issues by decentralizing data storage and management, thus reducing the risk of centralized points of failure and unauthorized access. Blockchain provides an immutable ledger, offering a transparent and verifiable record of transactions, which enhances trust among parties in data exchanges. Transparent, verifiable records are instrumental in scenarios where data accuracy and history are crucial, such as in supply chain management or personal health records.\nMoreover, Web3 introduces concepts such as self-sovereign identity, allowing individuals to own and control their digital identities without reliance on central authorities. Through smart contracts, users can automate permissions and conditions under which their data is accessed or shared, ensuring they retain control and potentially receive compensation for their data’s use.\nThese technologies also facilitate the creation of decentralized marketplaces for data exchange, where individuals and organizations can trade data in a secure, peer-to-peer environment. The opportunity can lead to more equitable data markets, where users are adequately compensated and data usage is transparent and consensual.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nWhat challenges exist in ensuring the authenticity and reliability of data in decentralized platforms?\nOne of the primary concerns is verifying data sources and the integrity of the data itself. In decentralized environments, where there is no central authority to oversee and validate information, mechanisms must be in place to prevent the dissemination of false or corrupted data.\nUtilizing blockchain technology to tokenize and unlock large volumes of “passive” data from various creators necessitates a robust system to distinguish between legitimate users and malicious actors or automated bots. Such a system should be underpinned by strong crypto-economic game theory principles, which can help incentivize good behavior and penalize bad, enhancing data reliability.\nFurthermore, the decentralized nature of these platforms often means that data comes from a wide array of sources, which can vary significantly in reliability and intent. The diversity requires sophisticated algorithms and consensus mechanisms to ensure that only accurate and verified data is accepted and maintained within the system. Ensuring consistency and reliability in such an environment demands continuous improvement and adaptation of these technologies to cope with evolving threats and maintain the data ecosystem’s integrity.\nHow can bonding and staking mechanisms improve trust and accountability in data exchange networks?\nFor instance, the Itheum Protocol introduces bonding and staking mechanisms to enhance trust and accountability within its decentralized data exchange network. By implementing a system where data creators must deposit a slashable bond during the Data NFT minting process, Itheum ensures creators have a financial stake in maintaining high-quality, reliable data outputs.\nThe slashable bond, held for a period determined by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), incentivizes good behavior by making it costly to engage in detrimental actions, as premature withdrawal results in significant penalties. Itheum Protocol’s mechanisms secure the network against bad actors and establish a foundation of trust for data consumers, who can rely on the integrity of the data thanks to the transparent accountability enforced through staking.\nBreaking Barriers!🌟#DataNFT enthusiasts, the moment is here!\n\nAll current and future Data NFTs are now accessible on any @MultiversX #NFT marketplace or platform.\n\nWith this update, Data NFTs provide all the utility of regular NFTs but add so much more.\n\nWhy NFT when you can… pic.twitter.com/PY0Qsz8JOM\n— Itheum (@itheum) December 23, 2023\nData Creator Bonding is now available on the Itheum Protocol. Interested parties can access the feature here.\nThe role of reputation score in data markets\nIn Itheum Protocol’s ecosystem, the “Liveliness” score plays a crucial role in shaping the reputation of participants within the data market. The Liveliness score measures a participant’s reputation, activity and advocacy within the data economy, influencing their trustworthiness and the perceived value of their data.\nAs participants engage more actively and responsibly in the ecosystem, their Liveliness score increases, signaling to other users and potential data consumers their commitment and reliability. The reputation score dynamic incentivizes participants to maintain high standards of participation, as a higher Liveliness score can lead to better data trade opportunities and greater rewards.\nHow can bonding periods and penalties enhance data authenticity?\nBonding periods and associated penalties are critical in enhancing the authenticity of data within the Itheum protocol. When data creators commit to a bonding period, they signal their long-term commitment to the platform and its users. The period acts as a guarantee of the creator’s ongoing activity and integrity, with the full knowledge that exiting the bond early or engaging in malpractice will result in substantial financial penalties.\nThe penalties deter potential bad actors and reassure data consumers of the creator’s authenticity and dedication. Additionally, the option for creators to renew their bond, which resets their Liveliness score to the maximum, continuously reinforces the trust between data creators and consumers, fostering a healthier and more reliable data marketplace.\nThrough the strategic use of bonding, staking and reputation scoring, Itheum Protocol creates a robust ecosystem where data authenticity, accountability and trust are prioritized. Itheum Protocol’s mechanisms ensure that only good actors with good intentions thrive, promoting a community-curated improvement of data quality in a “rules without rulers” environment.\nLearn more about Itheum Protocol\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Data\n#Web3\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.

Both shared their views on the factors behind the rapid growth of RWAs and why they believe “big institutions” such as BlackRock are bullish on the asset class.\nCointelegraph: What would you say is the driving factor behind the rapid growth of RWAs this year?\nVictor Sanchez: Interest has always existed due to the obvious advantages: removing middlemen (and their costs), an incredibly liquid and efficient 24/7 market and a transparent ledger. RWAs and TradFi have now found a counterparty safe, secure, composable and usable space in places and processes like the ones we implemented at Kinto.\nTokenized treasury products gre 782% in 2023, worth over $931 million as of Feb. 1. Source: CoinGecko\nCT: Can you share your views on why BlackRock has suddenly become quite bullish on RWAs?\nVS: RWAs are a multitrillion-dollar opportunity, and these big institutions are aware that blockchain technologies can go from 0 to 100 in a single bull market.\nReal-world assets’ total market capitalization. Source: Galaxy Research\nI honestly believe missing that train was simply not an option despite the day-one issues of being welcomed with a Tornado Cash dusting.\nCT: Could you elaborate in a few sentences about what types of liquidity can be unlocked from RWAs and how this increases the bottom line for money managers?\nAlan Keegan: Being able to transfer assets globally, 24/7, with T+0 settlement by itself is a huge benefit blockchains offer once the regulatory hurdles of using them to transfer securities are overcome.\nHowever, the ability to have any arbitrary transaction neutrally and atomically enforced makes a lot of transaction types easier and more cost-efficient. This means overcollateralized borrowing, yield stripping, claiming collateral on bad debt, and even issuing dollar-pegged stablecoins as liquidity against treasury collateral at close to 100% LTV [loan-to-value] can be automatically done with a click of a button or triggered based on conditions.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nIt’s difficult to think of any transaction type that won’t be improved by being on-chain once we’ve done the regulatory work to actually use the blockchain as the financial infrastructure layer and unlock its potential.\nCT: In terms of fragmented and stranded liquidity, what are the areas of unlocked capital that RWAs can free up, and how might this process take place?\nVS: RWAs face a unique liquidity and usability problem. The last bull and bear markets proved to institutions that for some transaction types, DeFi infrastructure offers benefits vs. traditional alternatives and operates smoothly even in extreme market conditions — in passive liquidity provision and overcollateralized lending, for example.\nHowever, despite being tokenized, most RWAs today aren’t usable for any of this on-chain. We can only unlock the value the institutions are looking for by doing KYC on the chain level while remaining an open network.\nCT: Is there a difference between DeFi and RWAs?\nVS: There are a few, but the lines are starting to blur, and that is a good thing. Many of the RWAs that are starting to get tokenized today are highly regulated products in the real world with strict counterparty requirements.\n“Historically, RWAs were missing a key aspect of DeFi: composability. We are fixing that.”\nCT: Can you explain how RWAs fix the composability issue that plagues DeFi?\nAs of today, RWAs require their own compliance framework, KYC systems, etc. Essentially, they are controlling who you are, what you own and who you can send it to. If you think about this problem on an L1 or on non-KYC’d L2s, it basically means that even for a very similar use case on different DApps or protocols, you need to go through their process, and they do not “talk to each other.”\nThis is why we believe the right abstraction model is to KYC at the L2 level so everyone is under the same set of rules and capabilities, allowing RWAs to free flow, compose and more.\nHow RWA bridges the gap between TradFi and Defi. Source: Binance Research\nCT: What are the current counterparty challenges with TradFi requirements for managing counterparty risk?\nIn any network, it does not matter if we are talking about an L1 or an L2, you are free to send anything to anyone, 24/7. That is the promise of crypto, and it is great in 99.9% of cases.\nHowever, in a compliance environment where you need to know exactly who sends you what and why, this becomes a true counterparty-compliance nightmare.\n“In our conversations with Trad-Fi, this counterparty issue is one of the most cited reasons for not being on-chain, followed by security and usability.”\nCT: What is Kinto doing to bridge the gap between TradFi and RWAs?\nVS: Kinto is the safety-first L2. In Kinto, every individual or corporation is KYC/KYB [Know Your Business] at the chain level. This information never leaves the KYC provider without user permission (we call this user-owned KYC), and it solves the counterparty requirements. \nOn top of that, by doing this at the chain level, we enable, for the first time, the composability for these RWAs, allowing for products that can only exist on Kinto.\nCT: It seems like RWAs are mainly for institutional investors and fund managers. How and when will retail investors be able to get a slice of the RWA pie?\nVS: Due to the regulation we covered in previous questions, it was easy for these institutions and accredited investors to access these products.\nHowever, as we facilitate counterparty requirements and other security elements (AML, fraud detection, Sybil resistance, etc.) protocols, we will be able to offer products to a much larger audience in Kinto than anywhere else.\nCT: What is your utopian vision of what full RWA mainstreaming looks like in TradFi, and how would that benefit the average investor?\nAK: Here is the dream for the future of Kinto. On Kinto, tokenized traditional ETFs could be provided as liquidity in an AMM like Uniswap or Curve. Your bank could be linked to your wallet, which is also used for payroll on-chain, and automatically approves and issues a mortgage using funds from an on-chain money market and the tokenized deed to your house as collateral.\nCorporate treasuries could be held in on-chain assets, and corporate debt issuance could happen through a DApp. Any modern financial asset can be issued and traded on-chain, and any modern financial service can be provided on-chain.\n“Our mission is not just to provide the first permissionless, decentralized network capable of supporting every traditional financial institution and every decentralized finance protocol. It is to provide the best infrastructure option for hosting the entire future financial system.”\nGet Access to Real-Time\nTrade Alerts Now\nClick Here For Instant Access\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

These fake accounts create artificial network activity to claim as many tokens as possible during airdrop events, which have become highly lucrative over the years. \n“We’ve recently taken action by banning approximately 2,000 users whom we suspect were farming Degen,” creators of the Degen memecoin project, which was built on the Farcaster social media protocol, wrote on X. “Taking part in Degen farming, such as coordinated posting or artificial engagement, could lead to bans.”\nThe Degen airdrop is ongoing until Aug. 1 and will reward users who engage with or create quality content posted on Farcaster social channels. However, it appears that a sizable number of users began posting subpar content for the sole purpose of earning airdrop points. “Joining organized actions mainly to earn tokens and posting unrelated content in boosted channels” will result in bans, Degen wrote.\nDegen\u0027s warning to Sybil attackers. Source: Degen\nThe memecoin project is far from the first protocol to suffer from Sybil attacks. \nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nOn April 4, self-custody wallet Bitget Wallet said it would deduct airdrop points from users who use “emulators and cloud phones” to create artificial wallet referrals and downloads to farm BWB token rewards. “Upholding fairness and integrity for all participants is paramount to us, and we cannot turn a blind eye to any dishonest behavior that violates the rules of conduct for the event,” Bitget Wallet wrote. \nThe Bitget Wallet airdrop has been ongoing for the past month and is scheduled to end on April 27. Users can earn rewards by referring friends, depositing tokens or performing decentralized finance (DeFi) swaps through the self-custody wallet. \nDespite identifying the problem, cracking down on Sybil attacks remain difficult. \n“To be certain that we do not inadvertently penalize honest users, we have identified and deducted points only for the top 50 users who boosted their referral points through illicit means,” explained Bitget Wallet. \nEarlier this year, prominent DeFi developer Banteg also raised an issue with the Ethereum layer-2 protocol Starknet and its airdrop. They claimed to have gone through all Starknet airdrops and “found 1854 people who have either renamed or deleted their account since the activity snapshot.” Banteg also identified an estimated 701,544 addresses that were allegedly linked to repeat or renamed GitHub accounts controlled by airdrop farmers.\nDespite such revelation, the airdrop farmers’ addresses were included in the Starknet airdrop anyway. Shortly after its launch, Starknet temporarily surpassed a fully diluted valuation of $20 billion. The airdrop is ongoing until June.\nIn a report by Gamic HQ last August, researchers explained that to deploy a Sybil attack, airdrop farmers “leverage scripts or bots to create a massive number of fake accounts on a targeted platform” that proceed to automate tasks such as “generating random usernames and emails, filling out registration forms, and even verifying accounts with CAPTCHAs.\"\nGamic HQ further wrote that Sybil attacks “amass a large portion of the airdropped tokens, leaving less for genuine users who might be more interested in using and supporting the project long-term.” As a result, a project’s reputation is damaged, its token supply inflates and price manipulation may occur as a result of excessive dumping by airdrop farmers after the event is over. \nHowever, the firm also noticed several positives as a result of the attacks. “The rise of Sybil attacks has pushed blockchain projects to develop more sophisticated methods for verifying user identities and ensuring fair airdrop distribution,” they claimed. “This ongoing battle will hopefully lead to a more robust and secure blockchain ecosystem in the long run.”\nRelated: Blockchain data-availability protocol Avail announces 600M token airdrop\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

This concept is expanded upon with leveraged tokens, which are backed by perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures contracts enable users to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date.\nLeveraged tokens bridge the gap between centralized exchanges (CEX) and the innovative, user-friendly approaches of decentralized finance (DeFi).\nDespite their benefits, leveraged tokens may encounter network congestion on blockchains with limited transaction capacity — especially on networks such as Ethereum, where transaction fees peak during congestion, the value of positions can be eroded and leverage support remains limited.\nTo overcome high transaction fees, money markets such as Aave and Compound operate on layer-2 blockchain networks, which are more efficient but still far from perfect. The number of assets supported by money markets such as Aave and Compound is limited, and the amount of leverage that users can acquire is very limited. Leveraged tokens that are built on top of money markets incur expensive rebalancing that can eat away at users\u0027 principal.\nIn response to these shortcomings, TLX has introduced leveraged tokens that are backed by perpetual futures contracts, which allows the leveraged tokens model to be both scalable and efficient.\nThe Uniswap for perpetual futures\nTLX, a DeFi platform built on Optimism — a layer-2 network on Ethereum — presents a permissionless, noncustodial leveraged token landscape.

However, he said he firmly believes in the idea of a decentralized way to send money worldwide “without intermediaries, with fast or instant settlement with low fees.”\n“I think it’s just a really powerful technology. We’re still early.

The occasion reduced mining rewards from 6.25 Bitcoin\nBTC\n$63,026\n per block to 3.125 BTC, worth about $200,000 at the time of writing.\nAt the Token2049 event in Dubai, Cointelegraph spoke with community members to get their thoughts on the Bitcoin halving and its potential impact on the crypto space.\nAttendees of the recent Token2049 event in Dubai. Source: Cointelegraph\nCrypto space could grow tenfold\nAvalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer shared two different perspectives regarding the halving. From a technological standpoint, Gün Sirer argued that the halving was not great. He explained:\n“As a technologist at my core, I see Bitcoin halving as not a great thing. Why? Because it’s a discrete event. All of a sudden the rewards going to miners go down by half. And suddenly, the security budget of the Bitcoin system goes down by half.”\nThe executive believes that the halving leads to “hundreds of millions” being paid to miners going down. Gün Sirer argued that this means less money secures the network.\nThe Avalanche founder believes that the Bitcoin creator was still “alive,” the Bitcoin halving might change. He explained:\n“I think if Satoshi were alive today, he would change the way the halvening is happening, not from a discrete function, from a sudden point function to a more continuous function, so that the rewards go down more gradually.”\nWhile the executive thinks that the halving could improve from a tech perspective, Gün Sirer also recognized that the event has had a good effect on crypto.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions. The event kicked off with a glamorous red carpet walk, followed by opening remarks from the Phemex founder.\nThe evening featured a range of activities, including expert insights from prominent figures, such as Cointelegraph CEO Yana Prikhodchenko, who shared her perspective on the growing trends in crypto media. A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\n“This creates a lot of speculation, a lot of buying into the space, a lot of people taking a position in Bitcoin, which in general has been great for the rest of the space as well,” he added.\nGün Sirer explained that it’s also great for renewed interest in crypto and predicted that the space is on its way to growing tenfold. “I see the crypto space growing by at least another factor of 10, if not more so. Bitcoin has a lot of growth ahead of it, in my view.”\nNo immediate impact\nWhile Gün Sirer highlighted the potential long-term growth of the crypto space, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph that the halving might not immediately affect the price. Ardoino explained:\n“I think the halving is something that is iconic, is something that is there, but not necessarily will affect immediately the Bitcoin price.”\nEven though the executive thinks the halving might not affect the BTC price, Ardoino remains bullish on the potential impact of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n“I don’t expect it. Maybe it will happen, maybe it will not. But I think that the Bitcoin halving was priced already. What was not necessarily priced was the enormous interest in the Bitcoin ETF,” he added.\nRelated: Here’s how crypto game Notcoin onboarded over 30M users — founder\nArdoino explained that the biggest hedge funds didn’t tap into the Bitcoin ETF yet. When pension funds and other hedge funds start investing, the executive said, “We’ll see big moves.”\nCode is law in crypto\nWith the ETFs bringing in new players to the crypto space, the halving shows how code works as the law in crypto, according to Justin Hyun, the director of investments at The Open Network (TON) Foundation.\nHyun believes that those experiencing the Bitcoin halving for the first time will see how the crypto space works. He explained:\n“It’ll be a further validation of. The way that the code is ultimately the law in crypto, as in this thing that was pre-designed from the get-go, takes place without anybody having to push a button.”\nThe executive hopes that when the larger community outside crypto sees this, they will become more curious about different networks and how they interact with the code and users.\nMagazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

It encompasses various components such as indexers, which organize blockchain data, and remote procedure calls (RPCs), enabling network interactions to function as if they were local. Additionally, middleware includes oracles and decentralized data storage services, which are software solutions that transfer real-world data to the blockchain.\nWhile middleware enhances the scalability and usability of DApps, its inherently centralized structure poses significant challenges. This centralization can lead to instability and risks a single entity gaining control, which threatens the core principles of decentralization within the Web3 ecosystem.\nTo address these concerns, the Web3 community is actively developing alternatives to reinforce the decentralization of the middleware layer. These efforts ensure the infrastructure remains robust and true to the decentralized ethos.\nInfrastructure for a decentralized future\nIn line with these developments, SubQuery Network offers a scalable and unified data infrastructure that supports the vision of a decentralized future. The platform offers a suite of tools designed to empower developers to bring DApps to life without compromising speed, flexibility and efficiency. SubQuery is assisting developers globally, with full support for over 160 networks, including many outside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) family.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nWith its native token, SQT, SubQuery integrates two core services — indexing and RPC — into a single decentralized network. Thus, users can access fully decentralized services (for example purchasing a plan for an RPC endpoint) with the simplicity of Web2 alternatives.\nThe platform tests the network’s load capacity through its free offerings. Additionally, the network is transforming with the beta launch of the SubQuery Data Node. The redesign of the structure and query language of RPCs leads to significant performance increases. Preliminary results show that the SubQuery Data Node enables the data indexer to run 3.9 times faster than The Graph.\nThe role of middleware on Web3 decentralization\nWhen discussing the evolution of Web3 decentralization, James Bayly, chief operating officer of SubQuery Network, emphasized middleware’s critical role:\n“The next era of Web3 decentralization will be in the middleware, the final frontier against centralized services and industry titans.”\nBayly pointed out the challenges faced by developers, stating, “Developers have long had to sacrifice performance and reliability when building DApps, we are working to make these sacrifices a thing of the past.” Bayly also highlighted that “many leading DApps are utterly reliant on centralized middleware components that could be turned off at any moment.”\nThe Web3 community focuses on making middleware more decentralized, paving the way for a secure, user-friendly and public digital environment. As we progress, the number of choices available to developers in Web3 will only increase.\nLearn more about SubQuery Network\n#Blockchain\n#Business\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

The FIRS lawyer argued that Gambaryan should represent Binance as the primary defendant, had been served, given that both Binance and its executives were charged together.\nHowever, Gambaryan’s lawyer, Chukwuka Ikuazom, objected, citing Nigerian law, stating he couldn’t plead until Binance, the primary defendant, was served.

The court mandated that Binance give the Nigerian government access to data and details of Nigerian traders using its platform.\nThe charges involve Binance’s failure to register with Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for tax remittance. Gambaryan was present in an Abuja court on Friday but did not enter a plea. However, Anjarwalla wasn’t present as he had escaped detention and left the country in March 2024.\nRelated: USA to forge AI partnership with Nigeria for economic growth\nApart from the tax evasion trial, Binance and its executives face charges of laundering over $35 million by Nigeria’s anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).

By the end of 2023, the number of global crypto users surged to as high as 580 million people, as estimated by crypto exchange Crypto.com.\nGlobal cryptocurrency users from January 2023 to December 2023. Source. Crypto.com\nDespite Bitcoin being the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the oldest, it apparently has fewer users than the entire crypto ecosystem.\nAccording to data from Technopedia, approximately 2.7% of the global population is estimated to own Bitcoin as of 2024, which translates to around 219 million people. If accurate, the estimated figure is up around 208% from 71 million Bitcoin users four years ago, as calculated by Crypto.com.\nWith Bitcoin or most other cryptocurrencies, most user count estimations can not be 100% accurate, as on-chain transaction analysis is often incapable of differentiating between long-term holders and lost BTC, as well as other factors.\n2024 pre-halving Bitcoin rally has not been seen before\nOne of the biggest differences between the fourth Bitcoin halving and the three past halvings is that the price has seen extraordinary growth pre-halving in 2024.\nIn the previous cycles, Bitcoin price recorded breakouts after the halving rather than before, and new all-time highs came roughly one year following the halving date.\nFor example, Bitcoin didn’t break out above the previously set ATH of $20,000 before the 2020 halving. In that cycle, the Bitcoin price only crossed ATH 10 months after halving. The picture is much different this time around.\nIn the current cycle, Bitcoin reached all-time highs right before the halving event, setting a record of $73,600 on March 13, 2024.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nSuch a breakout has never been seen before, and multiple analysts agree, including eToro crypto analyst Simon Peters.\nMiners ‘better shaped’ for halving this time\nThe never-seen-before Bitcoin price appreciation pre-halving has potentially had a positive impact on the mining industry as miners obtained more control over mining costs.\n“In comparison to the previous halving, it appears miners are in better shape overall in terms of lower levels of debt and potentially better control over their costs, such as electricity,” Fidelity Digital Assets’ director of research Chris Kuiper told Cointelegraph, adding:\n“What’s also helping miners this cycle is the price appreciation before the halving — something that also hasn’t been seen in previous cycles.”\nSince the third halving in May 2020, Bitcoin mining energy consumption has significantly increased, surging from around 50 Terawatt hours (Twh) to 99 Twh on April 18, 2024.\nBitcoin energy consumption. Source: Digiconomist\nAt the same time, the amount of Bitcoin network’s energy consumption powered by renewable energy sources has also increased, with renewables accounting for 54.5% BTC mining consumption as of January 2024, according to Bitcoin ESG Forecast. As of September 2020, this figure stood at 39%, according to data from CCAF.\nFirst Bitcoin halving with spot BTC ETFs in the U.S.\nOne of the most straightforward things about Bitcoin halving 2024 is that this halving is the first ever with BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) enabled in the United States.\nAfter many years of efforts, spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted trading in January 2024, opening exposure to Bitcoin for institutional investors.\nRelated: Not just the halving: Why analysts are bullish on Bitcoin in 2024\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen “blockbuster success,” which apparently reflects a spike in demand for Bitcoin.\nSource: Eric Balchunas\nSince the first day of trading, all ten spot Bitcoin ETFs combined have increased their holdings by at least 220,000 BTC, which is worth around $14 billion at the time of writing.\nBlackRock\u0027s spot Bitcoin ETF has attracted the biggest amount of inflows among 10 BTC ETFs, with its holdings surging more than 10,000% from just 2,621 BTC on the trading debut to 273,140 BTC on April 18.\nM2 CEO Stefan Kimmel said:\nLooking at the broader landscape, while halving garners attention, we are cognizant that it\u0027s just a part of a larger narrative. The confluence of ETFs, quantitative easing, and halving will define the future contours of the market.\nBitcoin became more globally decentralized and secure\nBitcoin has also significantly improved in terms of network security and decentralization. Since 2020 — when most new Bitcoin was mined in Mainland China — Bitcoin has emerged as a more distributed network.\nJust four years ago, Bitcoin mining in China amounted to nearly 80% of Bitcoin’s total mining hash rate globally. As of February 2024, the biggest Bitcoin mining countries are the United States with 40% of the total hashrate, as well as China and Russia, accounting for 15% and 12%, respectively, according to Hashlab Mining founder Jaran Mellerud.\nGeographic distribution of Bitcoin hash rate between September 2019 and January 2022. Source: CBECI\n“This geographic decentralization is continuing as miners migrate to Africa and Latin America to take advantage of cheaper electricity prices,” Mellerud said.\nAdditionally, the Bitcoin blockchain has become more resistant to attacks as its hash rate has surged five times since the previous halving.\n“It now requires five times more computing power and associated electricity supply, electrical infrastructure, and mining hardware to attack the network,” Hashlab Mining founder noted.\nMagazine: Bitcoin Halving will pump games, Shrapnel’s ‘simple’ secret revealed: Web3 Gamer\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

The Blockchain Association said the rule contains “fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of digital assets and decentralized technology.”\nCoinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the proposed rules would set a “dangerous precedent for surveillance of the everyday financial activities of consumers by requiring nearly every digital asset transaction — even the purchase of a cup of coffee — to be reported.”\nCommenters were no happier with the reporting rules for 2024.\nRelated: Study claims 99.5% of crypto investors did not pay taxes in 2022\nTax experts have also posted their comments on the web.

It could also significantly increase brokers’ administrative burden, as many process very large numbers of transactions.\nSource: Peter Van Valkenburgh\nIn addition, brokers will be forced to exchange information on digital asset transfers to determine the cost basis (initial value or purchase price) accurately, according to Gordon Law. They have no mechanism in place for such data sharing. Furthermore, there is no way to differentiate between self-transfers and taxable transfers if a crypto owner transfers assets between exchanges.\nTaxpayers who underreported their crypto income in previous years may be caught when they report their taxes in 2025.

Compared to another popular blockchain-based game called Axie Infinity, which had 2.78 million monthly active users at its peak in 2022, Notcoin showed that it’s possible to onboard millions of users into crypto through gaming.\nReporter Ezra Reguerra with Notcoin’s Sasha Plotvinov at the Token2049 event. Source: Cointelegraph\nIn a Cointelegraph interview at the Token2049 event, Plotvinov shared the story behind the game, which hit about 30 million users in March. The executive said the original goal was to just introduce crypto to users of the Telegram messaging app. He explained:\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\n“It just solved the issue. Or maybe, the task that we all had on how to bring users from Telegram to crypto. So basically, that was the original goal.”\nThe executive explained that his team spent years looking at Telegram’s massive user base and the TON blockchain, which had “almost zero action but had really good technology.”\nAfter going through the process, the team decided to go with the approach of simplifying the start of the onboarding process. Plotvinov explained:\n“At some point you just, you know, come to the idea. All right. So we just need to remove all the roadblocks for the beginning. Then, we need to give something to users so they have the motivation to go for all this Web3.”\nThe Notcoin co-creator said it became a very “social thing,” with interactions, competitions, leaderboards and squads. “It’s very, very important for such a game. And within Telegram, it’s really easy to basically onboard users, invite users,” he added.\nRelated: New Telegram mini-apps will be so convenient users won’t know it’s crypto\nPlotvinov said this was how the game became a social phenomenon, explaining that 53,000 communities competed with each other in an attempt to climb to the highest league.\nThe executive also explained that the team did not have a marketing budget. Everything happened “organically,” he explained, adding:\n“94% of Notcoiners came from referrals. People invited other people. We call them friends. You have friends, you just invite them and you play together, and you can see how they’re progressing.”\nPlotvinov also explained that the Notcoin project moved on from the common approach where projects attempted to convince users that it had value. “We just decided, all right, so why not reverse it and think more like ‘we’re not trying to convince you, it’s probably nothing,’ you know?”\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Gods Unchained app drops crypto, Kings of Fighters Arena review\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.

Blockchain is expected to penetrate 4.3% of the payment industry by 2025, as per a Cointelegraph Research report, suggesting a 95% growth potential.\nHowever, blockchain networks must solve fundamental problems to benefit from their untapped potential. Scalability and interoperability are highlighted as the primary shortcomings in individual blockchain use, and industry experts emphasize the need for blockchains to be interconnected rather than functioning as isolated entities.\nPolkadot 2.0 to solve blockchain’s inherent problems\nPolkadot, an open-source multichain protocol, enhances cross-chain transfers of data and assets through a network of specialized blockchains. Polkadot’s structure aims to solve key blockchain issues like interoperability, scalability and security by allowing different blockchains to transfer data and assets.\nPotential coretime configurations in Polkadot 2.0. Source: Polkadot\nThrough its parallel chains — parachains — which enable numerous transactions simultaneously, the network introduces a new vision with Polkadot 2.0. The introduction of coretime, designed to adapt computational resources in real-time to meet the network’s needs more efficiently, is at the core of Polkadot 2.0.\nCoretime denotes the availability of validator subsets as computational resources, or cores, for processing parachain blocks within the Polkadot network. Presently, Polkadot supports 50 such cores. These cores operate simultaneously, handling numerous complex tasks. Consequently, Polkadot is often dubbed the \"Polkadot Supercomputer,\" signifying its collective capacity to manage a vast array of tasks concurrently.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nPolkadot 2.0 introduces a dynamic core model that significantly enhances the platform’s capabilities. A core is a flexible, cost-efficient blockchain model that allows developers to access the Polkadot network’s security and interoperability on a pay-as-you-go basis without needing a dedicated parachain slot. Smaller projects with intermittent blockchain resource needs can benefit from Polkadot’s robust ecosystem through coretimes without the cost of leasing an entire parachain, which was a requirement in Polkadot 1.0.\nBesides cores, Polkadot uses a sharding mechanism that enhances scalability and increases transaction throughput. With the ability to validate up to 20 shards per block and the potential to grow to 100 shards, Polkadot boasts a transaction speed of approximately 1 million transactions per second (TPS) with asynchronous backing, compared to Ethereum 2.0’s throughput of 100,000 TPS.\nCoretime marketplace and improved governance\nThe coretime marketplace in Polkadot 2.0 allows developers to purchase block time dynamically and efficiently scale their operations, matching their computational and consensus needs. The revenue generated from these sales essentially functions as rental income.\nWith Polkadot 2.0’s scalability, decentralized applications (DApps) can dynamically adjust their resource usage based on demand. DApp developers can seamlessly integrate assets and functionalities across multiple blockchains, expanding the available market and liquidity pools.\nAiming to use a deflationary mechanism, Polkadot presented a proposal to burn the revenue from coretime sales. This decision is expected to make DOT more attractive for long-term retention, consistent with the network’s goals of improving security and efficiency across its ecosystem.\nPolkadot 2.0’s OpenGov enhances the platform’s governance structures, making them more democratic and inclusive. The governance model allows Polkadot\nDOT\n$7.09\ntokenholders to participate directly in decision-making.\nPolkadot differentiates itself from other blockchain networks by collaborating with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and says that its products are considered software, not securities. In this way, Polkadot aims to ensure compliance with securities laws and frame its native token, DOT, as a technology-focused asset rather than a financial instrument.\nChallenges and future outlook\nPolkadot stands as a pivotal and innovative presence in the blockchain sphere, striving to redefine the interoperability and scalability of diverse networks. With its multichain structure, Polkadot enhances scalability, interoperability and flexibility, which are key to the evolving Web3 framework.\nThe shift to Polkadot 2.0 signifies the platform’s proactive evolution, addressing many early challenges with more adaptable and efficient solutions. As with any emerging technology, the ongoing evolution and adaptation of the Polkadot network are critical to achieving widespread adoption and maintaining relevance in the swiftly progressing blockchain field.\nAs Polkadot continues to develop, its success in leveraging its unique capabilities and overcoming its challenges will play a crucial role in defining its position within the broader blockchain ecosystem. Polkadot’s progress reflects the overall growth and maturation of blockchain technology, demonstrating the potential to create a decentralized and interoperable future.\nLearn more about Polkadot\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#Scalability\n#Polkadot\nDisclaimer.

Telegram recently announced plans to share revenue with content generators on its platform through its Ad Network.\nDurov described the move as one of the most generous revenue-sharing models in the history of social media. He also said that 50% of the revenue Telegram receives from displaying ads and broadcast channels would be shared with channel owners and content creators using TON’s network:\n“All these transactions, the payments for ads, withdrawals of ads are powered by blockchain.

Tether also unveiled the launch gold-pegged Tether Gold (XAUT) stablecoin on TON.\nTON was initially developed by Telegram, but a subsequent legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission saw the messaging application abandon its development efforts in May 2020.\nA small group of open-source developers then took over the project, which led to the establishment of the TON Foundation in May 2021.\nMagazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto\nExchange or buy TON\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

These 300 million people are of no interest to the banking industry. These are great people, but they cannot be onboarded by the banking industry because they are too poor to be of interest.”\nRampant inflation is forcing people in emerging economies to increasingly look for external financial alternatives, such as the U.S. dollar.

Social signaling, says Avalanche founder","detailed_content":"Love them or hate them, memecoins are all the rage in 2024. Despite the inherent risks of aping a new coin, Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer believes they are bringing value and new users into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nSpeaking exclusively to Cointelegraph report Ezra Reguerra at Token2049 in Dubai, Gün Sirer weighed up the benefits and drawbacks of the rise of memecoins across several blockchain protocols. From Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana to Avalanche, memecoins have made fortunes and ruined portfolios in recent months.\n“They’re great for the space because they bring people in, they keep them excited, occupied and concentrated on what the technology can do,” Gün Sirer said.\nThe CEO of Ava Labs conceded that many critics argue that memecoins bring no value to the ecosystem, just as the rise of nonfungible tokens had detractors.

But you realize after a while that memecoins serve a purpose, and that purpose will not be obvious to boomers,” Gün Sirer said.\nThe former Cornell University professor sees memecoins as an opportunity for younger, risk-taking crypto enthusiasts to signal their aptitude for betting on the right projects.\n“What is that purpose? That purpose is social signaling. In the same way that some people use a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT as a profile picture, they’re saying I made so much money off trading that I can afford this,” Gün Sirer explained.\nThe Ava Labs CEO said that most memecoin traders are not holding tokens long-term and that the nature of the emergent trend relies on the ability to constantly adjust to the movement of value between different memecoins.\n“They don’t see it as an investment in that fashion. They see it as a transitory phase. It’s like riding a bike. It’s a dynamic equilibrium. you have to constantly make corrections.”\nGün Sirer conceded that luck also plays its part as traders jump from coin to coin. “You have to be at the forefront of that community movement. You have to guess right. It’s not easy to do, and not everyone can do it,” he said.\nThis is also why memecoins have “such a premium associated” with people who understand these memes and act early on projects.

It’s under that open governance and open development, and it has the backing of major companies, governments and organizations,” Barbosa explained.\nThe Hyperledger director said that organizations tapping into their technology stack care not only that the tools are open-source but that there is open development and an active community of diverse maintainers and code contributors.\n“Nobody wants to build new rails on code that one company owns. If that company goes out of business or changes its mind and says we’re no longer open source, you must pay license fees to continue using what you built.”\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

She highlighted critical infrastructure like Linux Kernel’s use in a myriad of computing systems as an example of the embeddedness of open-source infrastructure.\n“For the last 25 years, the Linux Foundation has been building open source communities and the most important code. Think Linux Kernel and Kubernetes. Essentially, all cloud computing runs on Kubernetes,” Barbosa said.\nRelated: Hyperledger onboards Citi, forms Besu working group headed by DTCC\nThe Linux Foundation GM said that several organizations have made efforts to open-source their software and code. However, she questioned whether making this information openly useable on GitHub does enough to make the tools openly developed and governed.\n“That’s what the foundation does; we bring that open governance and development. Banks who compete with one another can come and collaborate. Companies like Accenture and IBM could collaborate on things for the community,” Barbosa explained.\nRelated: Tokenized asset market could hit $16T on public blockchains — RippleX VP\nShe added that this is an essential long-term consideration for the financial services industry in the event that regulators begin to probe who owns what and makes changes to the underlying code.\nBarbosa also unpacked the development history of Hyperledger’s blockchain tools. Hyperledger Besu, a prominent Ethereum execution client, has become one of its most important infrastructure offerings.\nHyperledger Besu is an open-source Java Ethereum execution client. It offers public and private functionality and can run all Ethereum smart contracts. Users can use all Ethereum token standards, including nonfungible token standards ERC-20 and ERC-721.\nHyperledger Besu is among the top three Ethereum execution clients by user numbers.

Blockchain-based systems make it transparent and resistant to interference.\nUsing GPS-based navigation devices has become ubiquitous. People use tools such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and Foursquare, which rely on GPS. However, these services are plagued by a common fault — centralization — which makes them prone to opaque functioning and a central point of failure when it comes to hacking.\nBlockchain technology offers several advantages over centralized systems and helps users tide over the limitations of traditional tools like GPS mapping. It improves transparency, increases resilience to hacking attempts and enables faster data processing. Unsurprisingly, several businesses have begun to use blockchain technology or are actively exploring its application.\nThe inefficiencies in current interactive maps\nThough the current system of GPS-based interactive maps has been around for more than a decade, it has its share of inefficiencies. The data from these systems may sometimes be inaccurate and slow to load on devices.\nGPS mapping entails processing and storing enormous amounts of data, usually on centralized servers, which might cause delays when accessing and sharing. As these technologies track a person’s whereabouts in real time, they may jeopardize user privacy. Traditional GPS system development and maintenance might also be prohibitively expensive for businesses.\nCentralized mapping relies on proprietary data that may be outdated, failing to adequately reflect recent advances in roads, highways and infrastructure due to rapid change. GPS also faces difficulty in adequately mapping dense metropolitan areas. Creating interactive maps in regions with narrow lanes necessitates hard work from the mapping provider to document each area, which is both time-consuming and costly. Moreover, in civil applications such as surveying and transportation, GPS is unencrypted, lacks proof-of-origin or authentication features and is susceptible to cyberattacks, jamming and spoofing. \nMost mapping projects use crowdsourcing to enable their operations. In OpenStreetMap, for instance, a large number of contributors use GPS devices, aerial imagery and low-tech field maps to update map data. As the world pushes into the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), new crowdsourcing use cases are likely to emerge. However, problems like difficulty with accuracy and top-down policy implementation — which crowdsourcing projects have generally grappled with — may pervade. Blockchain-based mapping provides a viable alternative.\nHow blockchain augments interactive digital maps\nThe decentralized structure blockchain technology works on may provide effective answers to common difficulties in the usual interactive digital maps.\nGPS mapping requires processing and storing large amounts of data, usually stored on a single or a few servers. The centralized nature of GPS mapping can lead to processing and delivery delays due to the strain of handling large amounts of data on limited servers. Decentralized apps (DApps), however, distribute data over several network devices (nodes), reducing latency and allowing for smooth data access.\nAs these applications rely on a decentralized network of nodes to continuously validate transactions and data updates rather than a single centralized authority, they can keep location information more current and accurate. The blockchain’s consensus process, which needs confirmation from several nodes before accepting changes, preserves data integrity and protects it from illegal changes.\nBetter privacy is another advantage of using blockchain for mapping. Traditional GPS mapping compels consumers to send their location data to major organizations, which can then monetize this geotagged information without the users’ consent. On the other hand, Blockchain functions without centralized authority that can make unanimous decisions, with data spread across multiple nodes, improving user privacy.\nCan blockchains be used for spatial verification?\nSpatial verification in blockchain is the process of authenticating the physical location of an event, object or user within a decentralized network.\nSpatial verification refers to the confirmation that things are at the place where they claim to be. It is very useful in various industries, especially supply chain management.\nFor instance, when an Amazon delivery drone drops off a package at an owner’s door, the cost is charged to the owner’s account, relying on spatial verification. This eliminates problems with dishonest delivery persons and disagreements over charges for products that go missing.\nSimilarly, if someone has a broken windshield, they can use blockchain-based spatial verification to back up their insurance claim by sending a photo and documentation proving the time and location. This helps streamline insurance claim processing, reduces disputes and helps combat fraud.\nWhen one creates a new bank account remotely, spatial verification allows them to verify the residence by merely being present at their home rather than providing proof of address such as utility bill copies.\nA smart contract built in a blockchain-based proof-of-location (PoL) protocol would do spatial verification in these use cases. By providing a trustless way to prove location, PoL systems enhance transparency and efficiency in various industries.\nWhat is proof-of-location protocol?\nPoL uses a combination of cryptographic algorithms and consensus procedures to ensure the authenticity of a user’s location data without relying on a single authority.\nIn blockchain, PoL is the validation of a user’s physical position within a decentralized network. PoL assures the precision of location-based transactions and services in a range of applications, including supply chain management, asset tracking, decentralized finance and more. \nOne frequent approach to PoL is to use a network of trustworthy nodes or oracles to collect and validate location data from an array of sources, including GPS satellites, WiFi signals and cellphone towers. These nodes then verify the user’s location by broadcasting signed messages or proofs to the blockchain. \nBy implementing PoL into blockchain systems, users can securely engage with location-conscious smart contracts and DApps while maintaining privacy and trust. This technology expands the possibilities for location-based services and enables innovative use cases that require verifiable location data on the blockchain.\nCore elements of a PoL smart contract\nLocation data submissions, verification mechanisms, data storage, and linking spatial verification to specific actions are the core elements of a PoL smart contract.\nLocation data submission\nThe smart contract would define how users or devices submit location data, including: \nGeotagged photos or videos.\nGPS coordinates from a mobile device.\nSensor readings from IoT devices confirming a location.\nVerification mechanisms\nThe contract would need ways to verify the submitted location:\nUsing reputation systems to assess the reliability of data providers.\nCross-checking with multiple data sources.\nEmploying cryptographic techniques to prevent location spoofing.\nData storage\nA tamper-proof record would be created by securely storing the verified location data on the blockchain.\nTriggering actions\nThe spatial verification would be connected to particular activities by the smart contract, such as paying out in supply chain situations, approving claims made by insurance, or granting access upon verification of physical presence.\nWhat are the limitations of a proof-of-location protocol?\nDespite its potential, PoL has several drawbacks, including reliance on external data sources, scalability difficulties and variable applicability across geographies, among others.\nWhile PoL offers several advantages, it has significant limitations. One problem is the reliance on external data sources, which can lead to vulnerabilities for manipulation or spoofing. Additionally, PoL may face scalability concerns because confirming location data for a large number of transactions demands significant processing resources.\nMoreover, PoL solutions may not be universally applicable across geographic regions or situations, resulting in inconsistent verification accuracy. There are no standardized methods for incorporating geographic locations, physical addresses or coordinates into smart contracts. \nEach developing platform has its own hardware infrastructure, protocols and business models. Addressing these restrictions is critical to the general adoption and efficacy of PoL in blockchain applications.","tags":[],"author":"by Dilip Kumar Patairya","creation_date":"2024-04-19"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-gambaryan-bail-application-delayed","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Gambaryan’s lawyer, Mark Mordi, criticized the prosecution for failing to file a response to the additional affidavit submitted with his bail application.","title":"Binance exec remains in jail as bail appeal fails again","detailed_content":"A Federal High Court in Abuja, Nigeria has once again postponed the bail application hearing for Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, who remains in custody at the Kuje correctional center. \nOriginally set for April 18, the court has rescheduled the hearing for April 22, according to local news agency Nairametrics.\nDuring the court session, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) told the court that Gambaryan’s lawyer submitted an additional affidavit to his bail application on April 16.\nSenior counsel E.

Communities of these various protocols have also become fervent defenders of their respective blockchains, a point that Dixon said detracts from advancing the utility of the underlying infrastructure. She said:\n“It’s really funny. There is tribalism, but sometimes, we continue to promote the tribalism instead of focusing on what’s really true.”\nShe pointed to recent network outages and congestion issues across major protocols, including the likes of Solana and various Ethereum layer-2 protocols, including Base, Arbitrum and Starknet.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

At a higher level, Dixon said there is more thought-share and support than people would realize.\n“There is less tribalism than people actually think at the executive level. Like, people are always saying, ‘You and Brad Garlinghouse from Ripple must not get along,’ but actually we do.”\nDixon added that individuals and organizations that are driving the adoption of decentralized protocols share a common belief that the industry is “not a winner-takes-all market.”\n“Anybody who’s spent any time on the internet understands that.

Yesterday, there were sharp spikes in price on certain venues that impacted the price of USDP on pricing aggregators. Paxos does not control markets or trading activity on other trading venues.”\nThe depegging happened during a significant market cap increase for USDP, which briefly rose from a $140 million market cap to a $181 million market capitalization when the coin hit $1.29, according to CoinMarketCap.\nUSDP market capitalization, weekly chart.

Paxos offers APIs that offer 1:1 redemption 24/7.

It’s starting to unfold,” Infanger said.\nTradFi wants holistic blockchain solutions\nThe executive said that research estimates pin the future value of tokenized markets at $16 trillion, which is eight times bigger than the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector.\n“A couple of years ago, many of us in this space were envisioning that. It’s getting closer to reality, and it’s happening on public blockchains. At some point, it looked like it would only happen on JPMorgan Coin or IBM.”\nInfanger said that advanced conversations with various financial institutions are ongoing, and they are exploring tokenization projects to issue assets on the XRP Ledger.

The combination is a holistic digital asset infrastructure value proposition for traditional finance and developers who want to solve DeFi problems,” Infanger explained.\nRipple’s stablecoin\nRipple’s recently announced plans to issue its own United States dollar-pegged stablecoin on XRPL and Ethereum will complement its offering to institutions. Cointelegraph previously spoke to Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz about the details of the stablecoin.\nInfanger added further detail to the impetus behind Ripple’s stablecoin, highlighting that the stablecoin market could reach $2.8 trillion in five years given that there are some $22 trillion that are off-chain.\n“Right now, we’re at $130 billion, so there’s clear demand, and there’s an expected trajectory of enormous growth. We’re really still at the early days,” Infanger said.\nAnother key driver was constant requests from developers in the XRPL ecosystem for a tier-one stablecoin offering like USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\nor Tether\nUSDT\n$1.00\n. Infanger said Ripple had used stablecoins in small-scale experimentation alongside XRP\nXRP\n$0.52\nand its payment product.\n“We really envision our institutional DeFi use case, on one hand, tokenization on XRPL and then in our payments product for optionality and some use cases alongside XRP using the stablecoin and for the XRP ecosystem as a whole.”\nRipple has not yet confirmed when it will launch its stablecoin or what it will call the XRPL and Ethereum-based token.\nExchange or buy XRP\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nIn December 2023, the team announced plans to launch an “Open Network” or mainnet in 2024 if certain conditions are met. These conditions include that 100 Pi apps must have been developed in addition to the 15 million users passing KYC. In addition, the team must have completed all “technology, product, business and legal” work needed to launch the network, and there must not be an “unfavorable external environment” that would hinder the network’s success. The team has not yet announced a specific date for mainnet launch.\nAIMultiple analyst Cem Dilmegani claimed that Pi Network will probably not benefit users, stating, “[w]e don’t expect anyone except the founders to benefit from PI Network in a significant way.” That’s because it “works like a direct selling or affiliate marketing system, promising future rewards to users for bringing in new users.” Dilmegani claimed that the affiliate marketing system is used to drive traffic to the app, which is, in turn, used to sell advertising for the benefit of the app’s developer. “Founders are already benefitting from the app,” Dilmegani stated, as they “launched optional video ads at launch to monetize the active user base.”\nDilmegani acknowledged that the Pi team could eventually launch a blockchain mainnet. However, he argued that this was unlikely because it would cause the token to rapidly fall in value as users sold into the market. “Then, the coin would not be valuable enough for people to keep on logging in to click,” which would potentially eliminate the value of the app to advertisers.\nCointelegraph reached out to the Pi team for comment. In response, a representative acknowledged that Pi had taken an “unconventional and novel” approach to blockchain development, such as providing “an intermediate Enclosed Network period of mainnet” instead of launching an open network immediately. This novel approach was taken to “enable utilities building on the platform and KYC processing of millions of our community members, to help the community further build a robust network for the benefit of the whole community before we launch the Open Network.”\nThe representative claimed that Pi has accomplished multiple goals since its launch, including the creation of “Pi mining mobile app, Pi Browser mobile app as the interface of the Web3 ecosystem, Node application, Testnet and Mainnet blockchains, Wallet, developer platform, a novel KYC solution” and more. The representative argued that not launching an open network right away was worth it, stating, “We believe anything worthwhile takes time and patience, and such components are essential for a healthy launch of the Open Network.” \nAccording to a March 3, 2021 report from Vietnamese media outlet vnExpress, Pi Network is the 22nd most downloaded iOS app in Vietnam. In May 2021, a Vietnamese news outlet reported that Pi had inadvertently leaked images of users’ identity cards to a hacker. However, a Pi Network spokesperson stated that the app handled KYC through a third-party and did not store this data on its servers, nor was there any evidence of a data leak.\nRelated: Vietnam government warns about crypto trading risks as Pi gains in popularity.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

On traditional social media platforms, such as X, user data is held and accessed through a centralized control method wherein the company itself retains ownership of all data.\nIn TikTok’s case, this ostensibly means that ByteDance — and, by legal extension, the government of China — owns all of the platform’s user data, including more than 150 million U.S.-based users.\nBy placing data on the blockchain and implementing specific privacy controls, a social media network can give users control over their data without compromising platform functionality.\nRelated: Worldcoin launches its own ‘human-centric’ blockchain network\nWhile MeWe’s user base doesn’t quite stack up to TikTok’s, the company’s transition to blockchain shows that it’s possible.\nTo that end, Edell shared six best practices for other companies considering the change in his Rolling Stone article: understanding the technology, starting small, choosing the platform that’s right for your organization, staying up to date with regulatory compliance changes, collaborating with stakeholders, and ensuring employees are educated and trained on blockchain.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Its own dedicated network has been designed to scale alongside the broader Ethereum network as a layer 2 to meet the project’s needs.\nCointelegraph spoke with Tiago Sada, the head of product, engineering and design at Worldcoin, to better understand the project’s intention with its network and how it plans to keep humans in the center.\nRelated: Worldcoin: Trail of Bits audit shows no direct vulnerability for Orb software\nSada said that while technically, World Chain will act similarly to any other L2 and Ethereum, its nuance is that it prioritizes humans over bots, with blockchains often facing congestion due to bot activity. \n“Usually, the way it works is that every account is fighting for block space. Usually, since bots can move faster and they can outbid humans,” he said, “the networks get saturated with all the transactions for bots, and humans have whatever is left — many times, they can’t even get in.”\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nWorld Chain’s solution tries to troubleshoot this by favoring transactions completed by verified World ID holders:\n“It’s going to be an open and permissionless network like everyone else, but we are going to prioritize transactions for humans so that their transactions definitely get in, and then the remainder of the block space is just like any other blockchain.”\nAdditionally, Sada explained how verified users will receive a free gas allowance, minimizing friction for newcomers. The protocol aims for an equilibrium where bots and power users ultimately cover gas fees for casual users.\nHe explained how the Worldcoin Foundation would provide an “allowance” to verified humans, which would make their couple of monthly transactions gas free.\n“The idea with that is just to make it a lot easier for people to get started, so that one does not need to go through the pains of unwrapping and understanding all these things.”\nThe network aligns with Ethereum and also collaborates with projects like Optimism and Base. Worldcoin anticipates a full launch in the summer, with a soon-to-be-expected developer preview.\nThis announcement comes on the heels of a series of changes the project has been implementing, including tightening its privacy checks to improve the protection of user data and ensure that its platform is available only to people over 18 while also allowing permanent deletion of the user’s iris code. \nOn March 22, Worldcoin even made its orb software open-source and implemented a new “personal custody” privacy feature.\nThese moves follow scrutiny from world governments over its privacy practices, which have led to some temporary bans on operations in countries such as Portugal, Kenya and Spain.\nResponding to the scrutiny, Sada said it is only the natural process of introducing a new protocol that is “fortunately” scaling at Worldcoin’s pace.\n“When any project starts getting to scale, it’s the government’s job to go in and make sure that everything that the project is saying is actually true. And I think that’s completely natural.”\nMagazine: 1 in 6 new Base meme coins are scams, 91% have vulnerabilities\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nWeekly snapshot of key business trends in blockchain and crypto, from startup buzz to regulatory shifts.

But for everyone who hits a major payday, there is inventively someone else who loses tons of money by betting too much on the wrong coin.\nIt seems like everyone has a strong opinion on memecoins, whether they think they bring a sense of joy and fun to crypto that is often missing or think they distract from the real-world issues blockchain seeks to solve.\nOn episode 14 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond speak with Andreas Brekken, founder of no-sign-up crypto exchange SideShift.ai, about the positives and negatives associated with the memecoin frenzy, as well as what it all means for crypto as a whole.\nThe benefits of memecoin hype\nBrekken believes that memecoins are overall “a super easy and friendly way for normal people to get involved in crypto just using your phone” and “a completely harmless way to use crypto” with one’s friends.\nHe argued that memecoins are a net positive for the crypto ecosystem, as they help people engage with blockchain technology and learn more about how cryptocurrencies work. They also function as a real-world testing ground for the technology:\n“We’re testing real stuff because the same technology we can use to trade memecoins is literally the same technology we use to trade any other assets on-chain or cross-chain.”\nThe chain-congesting frenzy on Solana, for example, will force the network to improve its speed and reliability, which will ultimately benefit the blockchain in the long term, said Brekken.\nWhen asked what more serious crypto projects can learn from meme tokens, Brekken said he admires the speed at which memecoins are able to build strong communities. He also pointed out that many memecoin developers burn their liquidity provider tokens so that their initial liquidity cannot be removed, demonstrating their commitment to a project — something other developers might imitate in the future.\nMemecoin gambling\nMost memecoins admittedly have no intrinsic or real-world value. As such, many people approach them as a gambling opportunity, one where there is the hope of making life-changing money. However, a large number of memecoin projects end up being outright scams and rug pulls, meaning that investors face the very real possibility that their funds will go to zero.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nBrekken compared gambling on memecoins to gambling at Vegas or on sports: Some people go to casinos with a small amount of money and have fun with their friends no matter the outcome, while others cash out their life savings, lose it all on black and are left with nothing but regrets.\nHe added, however, that one must zoom out to get the bigger picture rather than being upset at memecoins themselves:\n“Maybe the bigger question is, why are people gambling so much? I think one way to look at this is it may be that people are gambling because they don’t trust the system to give them a fair chance, and they’re looking at the inflation, and your money is becoming worthless all the time, and your salary is not going up. So it could be that it’s just a symptom of a financial system that people don’t trust.”\nTo hear more from Brekken’s conversation with The Agenda — including his thoughts on token names and free speech, the future of memecoins, and how memecoin seasons influence the broader crypto ecosystem — listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

I always believed that Tether cannot be alone. The stablecoin ecosystem is an industry because there are many players,” Ardoino said.\nStablecoins have become an increasingly important cog in the wider cryptocurrency space.

If you have a group of great companies, then you are more effective.”\nArdoino also believes that Ripple’s intent to launch a stablecoin later in 2024 is indicative of the amount of room for more players to offer legitimate fiat-backed tokens.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nRelated: Tether’s USDT stablecoin hits historic $100B market cap\n“I believe that there is space for everyone.

All these countries are looking for an alternative to the national currency. The inflation in these countries and nations has been going through the roof,” Ardoino said.\nHe added that more than 2 billion people remain unbanked, living off less than $300 a month. This leaves a large number of people without bank accounts and unable to transact in conventional economies.\nRelated: Tether boosts Bitcoin reserves with latest acquisition\nThe growing accessibility of digital wallets means that people are becoming increasingly able to save in digital forms of money like USDT or USDC. As Ardoino said, the simplicity of these offerings reflects a bleak reality of the global economic landscape:\n“USDT’s digital dollar is nothing fancy. It simply moves on a blockchain. The sad reality is that the success of stablecoins is also directly proportional to the macroeconomic issues happening in this world.”\nArdoino maintains that circulating USDT is overcollateralized by 106%. Tether also intends to move toward 100% reserves in U.S. Treasury bills.

This “waste gas” is typically either routed to a facility where it can be converted into something useful such as electricity or burnt off into the atmosphere.\nDue to the remote location of many of Iraq’s oil fields, it’s long been considered economically infeasible to convert the flare gas and, as such, much of it ends up polluting the atmosphere.\nIraq’s Rumaila oil field is the world’s biggest producer of toxic flare gas, though efforts are reportedly underway to capture and repurpose as much as 60% today, with the target of ending all gas flaring in the country by 2027.\nBitcoin Mining\nPeople have used everything from nuclear energy to their own excrement to mine cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin mining firm Giga, a Texas startup, uses the flare gas from local oil fields to power truckloads of portable mining rigs. Per a report from CNBC, the company was earning millions in profits as far back as 2021.\nIn Iraq the challenge comes at a much higher scale. As the world’s largest producer of flare gas pollutants, it would take an exceptional effort to convert 100% of its pollutants into usable electricity.\nHowever, as noted above, Iraq currently has to balance its domestic energy requirements with its foreign debt. While adding power to the grid could certainly help ease the nation’s burdens, converting a portion of that electricity into Bitcoin mining could have an even greater positive impact.\nRelated: Crypto firm 7RCC is quietly advancing its eco-conscious spot Bitcoin ETF\nAnother potential avenue for using the energy provided by captured flare gas is in the area of carbon credits. Theoretically speaking, Iraq could not only reduce its own carbon footprint by capturing flare gas, but it could engage the international market by selling carbon credits via the blockchain. This would provide immutable proof of the nation\u0027s efforts and a potential temporary revenue stream as it pursues the reduction of its dependence on fossil fuels.\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

In September 2022, Ethereum made the long-awaited transition to a proof-of-stake network, and Bitcoin’s hash rate increased threefold throughout the year. The market also rebounded strongly in 2023.\nHere are some of the major industry events between 2022 and 2023.\nEXPLORE THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO\nU.S. inflation rates have topped out, for now\nCrippling inflation was one of several macroeconomic factors that contributed to the 77.2% price drawdown for Bitcoin\nBTC\n$62,974\nfrom its previous all-time high of $68,990 to a cycle low of $15,740 in November 2022.\nIn fact, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate topped out at 9.1% in June 2022, marking its highest level since 1982, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nFortunately, CPI inflation started trending downward after June 2022, bottoming out at around 3% in June 2023. Since then, monthly figures have hovered around the 3% range.\nChange in CPI inflation over the last 20 years. Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\nSince June 2023, Bitcoin has soared over 135% from $30,480 to set a new all-time high above $73,000.\nHowever, the CPI inflation rate has risen 11.65% since November 2021, meaning Bitcoin still hasn’t hit its inflation-adjusted all-time high. That will happen when Bitcoin notches $77,026.\nU.S. national debt continues to soar\nThe U.S. national debt continued its exponential rise in 2022 and 2023, increasing 4.35% to $33.2 trillion over those two fiscal years, according to data from the U.S. Treasury.\nChange in U.S. national debt over the last 100 years. Source: U.S. Treasury\nThe debt, which has since risen to $34.5 trillion, has put the U.S. on an “unsustainable fiscal path,” according to U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nFortunately, the U.S. debt to gross domestic product ratio has decreased from about 3.2% to approximately 123%.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania say financial markets can only withstand another 20 years of accumulated deficits projected under current U.S. fiscal policy.

BlockFi also went bankrupt — citing loans it lost from FTX — while Three Arrows Capital filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy after its excessive leverage on long positions was wiped out.\nCelsius and Voyager were other notable firms that filed for bankruptcy.\nFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud in November 2023 for his role in orchestrating what some described as the largest fraud in U.S. history.\nSource: Tiffany Fong\nThe $50 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem and its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) also caused carnage in May 2022.\nThe man largely responsible for that collapse was Do Kwon, the former CEO of Terraform Labs, who spent more than five months on the run in several countries before finally being detained at immigration control in Montenegro for using a fake Costa Rican passport.\nHe faces fraud charges in his home country of South Korea and in the U.S. for the role he played in the Terra collapse.\nThe SEC became even more determined to catch the remaining “hucksters,” “fraudsters” and “scam artists” in the cryptocurrency industry after Bankman-Fried.

They work like a secret handshake between two parties, proving that one person has signed off on something without revealing their secret code.\nRelated: Unpacking Schnorr Signatures: Blockstream’s MuSig to Improve Bitcoin Transactions?\nThe implementation will allow ICP smart contracts to sign Schnorr signatures to etch Bitcoin Runes, inscribe Ordinals in a decentralized manner, send, receive and bridge BRC-20 tokens directly on the Bitcoin base layer, sign taproot transactions and re-inscribe Ordinals.\nICP anticipates the full implementation of threshold-Schnorr to be launched midway through 2024. ICP integrates the core implementation of threshold-Schnorr-BIP340, which enables smart contracts to derive addresses and authorize native Bitcoin transactions.\n“Schnorr allows extra functionality, like batching transactions. It also allows for new use cases that are developing on Bitcoin. You see people inscribing Ordinals over the last year, it will help do this without any tweaks and from other chains,” Connolly explains.\nThe researcher added that the ability to inscribe Ordinals or etch Runes following the Bitcoin halving generally requires using Schnorr signatures. Connolly said Schnorr signatures are similar to ECDSA signatures that Bitcoin uses to control its ownership, but the former is “simpler, faster and more secure.” She said:\n“If you have Schnorr as a native thing, then it allows smart contracts to directly write or etch runes on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is pretty special. I don’t know anyone who’s doing this at the moment.”\nThe hope is that combining Schnorr signatures with ICP’s protocol-level integration with the Bitcoin network will open possibilities for decentralized applications (DApps) and services that can leverage the liquidity and security of Bitcoin without relying on centralized bridges. \nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

Let’s say you have an existing DApp on Ethereum, and you want to leverage Bitcoin. You can have an ICP smart contract that works alongside it to talk and write to Bitcoin,” Connolly explains.\nOthers are building applications from scratch using ICP. Connolly highlighted Taler DAO, an algorithmic Bitcoin-backed stablecoin, as an example of new experiments using the infrastructure.\nRelated: Bitcoin Core Devs Reveal How Schnorr Signatures Can Help Scale Bitcoin\nAnother consideration is how the integration will be received by the wider Bitcoin community. “OG” Bitcoiners are typically skeptical of integrations and solutions that promise to bridge the preeminent cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain to other chains.\nConnolly said conversations with Bitcoin proponents suggest that there is an open attitude toward infrastructure that broadens the utility of Bitcoin:\n“Some of the work that we’re doing is being picked up by Bitcoiners and in the BitVM Telegram chat, they\u0027re discussing the stuff that we\u0027re doing and how it can be used.”\nThe researcher believes the Bitcoin community is generally open to exploring and considering using tools like decentralized exchanges on ICP that supports noncustodial wallets. Connolly said this would allow DeFi capabilities like staking Bitcoin without relinquishing control of a user’s private keys.\n“If Bitcoin is the kind of de facto store of value in a digital currency like cryptocurrency, why can it not be the sort of de facto like hyper-secure compute platform as well?”\nICP now has over 300 developers building Bitcoin-enabled DApps in the field of DeFi, NFTs, gaming and social media. ICP introduced Bitcoin integration in 2022. Using chain key cryptography removed the need to use bridges for cross-chain functionality, allowing ICP smart contracts to hold, send and receive Bitcoin.\nMagazine: Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

IBC makes diverse chains compatible by enabling trustless communication and value exchange, especially tokens.\nThe IBC protocol was created and introduced by Cosmos Network in 2019 to address the issue of isolated blockchains, enabling them to safely exchange assets and data and promoting a more accessible and scalable blockchain ecosystem. Furthermore, the Interchain Foundation (ICF) established the Interchain Standards (ICS) to specify the necessary functions for the IBC protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem.\nIBC provides a valuable solution to the common issue of cross-chain messaging. This issue is particularly relevant for exchanges aiming to conduct swaps, application-specific blockchains where assets likely originate on specialized chains and private blockchains seeking connectivity with other chains, whether private or public.\nKey features of the IBC protocol\nThe IBC protocol facilitates secure and trustless communication between interconnected blockchains through dedicated channels and smart contract modules.\nOne significant aspect of the IBC protocol is its facilitation of interoperability among blockchains without requiring direct communication between them. Blockchains can communicate seamlessly by sending information packets through special channels, which employ smart contract modules equipped with a light client to verify the legitimacy of the received state. This enables blockchains, regardless of their protocols or consensus mechanisms, to transfer value or data seamlessly.\nIBC is trustless and permissionless, meaning anyone can act as a relayer. The blockchains involved don’t have to trust the parties transferring the information. This setup is crucial for achieving blockchain sovereignty without isolating blockchains, which is a major goal of the Cosmos ecosystem.\nThrough the integration of smart contract modules with light client verification, IBC ensures that the information exchanged between blockchains is valid without requiring direct communication. This eliminates the need for blind trust between parties and enhances the overall security of the ecosystem. Through the use of cryptographic primitives and consensus mechanisms, such as Tendermint, IBC ensures the security and integrity of cross-chain transactions. \nThe IBC protocol ensures security and validity through cryptographic techniques and consensus algorithms inherent to each participating blockchain. Data privacy and integrity are maintained during transmission.\nHow does the IBC protocol work?\nThe IBC protocol revolutionizes how different blockchains communicate, offering a seamless transfer of data between them. \nThe IBC protocol works in two layers: the TAO layer, which stands for transport, authentication and ordering; and the APP layer, an abbreviation of application. The TAO layer sets up secure connections and verifies data between blockchains, acting like a foundation. On top of that, the APP layer specifies how data is packaged and understood by different blockchains.\nIn the Interchain Standard, the client ensures trustless verification of data, and the relayer facilitates the transfer of information between blockchains. Together, they create a robust framework where the standard sets the basic protocols, the client ensures data integrity, and the relayer manages the actual transfer process, enabling seamless communication between different blockchains.\nAt its core, IBC relies on three key components: hubs and zones, packet transactions and smart contracts. Hubs and zones act as central routers and individual blockchains, respectively. Hubs facilitate the relay of transactions and data between zones, enabling cross-chain communication.\nPacket transactions are units of data transferred between blockchains. These packets contain sender, recipient and transaction data, allowing for efficient communication between zones. Smart contracts play a crucial role in IBC’s operation. Each blockchain involved in communication implements IBC/TAO modules comprising smart contracts. These modules facilitate the orderly transfer of data packets between blockchains.\nThe process of transferring data via the IBC protocol is straightforward: When a user initiates a cross-chain transaction, the packet travels from the source zone to a hub, which then relays it to the destination zone. After processing the transaction, the destination blockchain takes the same path back to deliver a response. The TAO layer handles the infrastructure and security aspects of transferring the data packets between zones, while the APP layer determines how the data is packaged and understood by the sending and receiving blockchains.\nImplications of the IBC protocol for various stakeholders\nThe IBC protocol can improve the user experience by giving users additional ways to access various applications for trading, developing or other uses.\nThe IBC protocol allows basic users to get access to a wider variety of decentralized apps (DApps) and services on various blockchain platforms. Users may safely and effectively transfer digital assets, including tokens and cryptocurrency, across several blockchains with IBC. \nThe IBC protocol is used by traders to increase trading potential and improve their strategies on different blockchain networks. Traders may easily diversify their portfolios, take advantage of price disparities, and access liquidity pools across platforms by executing cross-chain transactions with IBC. \nThis interoperability eliminates barriers to entry and exit between different blockchain-based assets, promoting market efficiency and liquidity. Additionally, by quickly transitioning to alternate networks through IBC, traders can reduce the risks related to network congestion or outages on certain blockchains.\nBy utilizing the IBC protocol’s capabilities, developers can create innovative DApps and improve the functionality of already existing ones. Developers can also build interoperable solutions that communicate with various blockchain networks and facilitate cross-chain asset transfers, data exchange and smart contract interoperability by including IBC in their applications. \nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs), gaming networks and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are just a few examples of the complex decentralized ecosystems that can be created because of this interoperability. In addition, the IBC protocol speeds up and lowers development costs by offering standardized protocols and toolkits for creating cross-chain communication channels.\nThe future of the IBC protocol\nIBC has the potential to create a more connected, robust and welcoming crypto environment by lowering entry barriers and creating opportunities for collaboration.\nBy enabling seamless communication between diverse blockchains, IBC breaks down silos and opens up a new era of interoperability. This has far-reaching implications: Complex DApps, innovative financial products and thriving ecosystems become possible through the free flow of assets and data across chains. Users can interact with multiple networks without sacrificing security or rewards.\nWithout this interoperability, users often have to choose between simply swapping tokens or directly participating in a blockchain network. The IBC protocol removes this dilemma, allowing users to interact with multiple networks without sacrificing security or potential rewards.\nHowever, realizing IBC’s full potential hinges on overcoming technical challenges and establishing robust governance frameworks. Without standardization, competing interoperability protocols could lead to fragmentation, undermining progress. To create a future where IBC truly underpins an integrated crypto ecosystem, collaboration and standardization among blockchain projects are crucial.","tags":[],"author":"by Tobias Vilkenson","creation_date":"2024-04-16"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/arkham-top-doxed-crypto-hodlers-own-3-billion","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Around $1.2 billion worth of crypto in the top five holders’ wallets have been flagged as ‘inaccessible’ due to lost private keys.","title":"Arkham’s top 5 doxed crypto hodlers own $3.5B, but 35% is untouchable","detailed_content":"The top five identified crypto whales with publicly known wallet addresses hold around $3.5 billion in crypto, according to a dashboard from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.\nHowever, due to lost passwords and private keys, a large chunk of it is inaccessible. \nOn April 15, the on-chain intelligence platform announced the updated dashboard revealing the holdings of some of the world’s on-chain-verified richest crypto holders and whales, including Tron’s Justin Sun and Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin.\nThe top five crypto holders on its list currently own an aggregate of $3.47 billion in digital assets, according to the data.

The halving will generate a revenue shock for miners and reduce the amount of new BTC issued in the market.\nIn the latest Cointelegraph video, we delve into the potential impact of this event for both miners and investors.\nMost industry participants do not expect the halving to be a cause for concern for the mining industry but rather view it as an opportunity for miners to become more efficient.\nMiners have had four years to prepare for this event by upgrading their mining rigs and seeking out locations where electricity is cheap.\n“We\u0027ll see a lot of miners start to diversify energy wise”, predicts Will Baxter, SVP at Business Strategy and Development at Braiins, a Bitcoin mining company.\n“They go to landfills, and they’ll use that trash for mining Bitcoin [...] A lot of miners are going to migrate towards stranded energy,” he continued.\n“I don’t think we will see a very large drop in hash rate after the halving, maybe around 10% or less,” said Jaran Mellerud, co-founder and CEO of Hashlab Mining.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin halving will likely impact the price of Bitcoin as it has in the past. In the months following the halving, the supply shock may cause prices to spike, assuming that demand remains constant or increases in any meaningful way. \nPrice predictions range from $120,000 by the year\u0027s end to $250,000 by the end of 2025.\nHowever, the halving does not occur in a vacuum: the macroeconomic landscape will play a major role in determining the price of Bitcoin in the short to medium term. \nAccording to Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg, a downturn in the stock market may put pressure on Bitcoin despite the halving.\n“We just have to see if Bitcoin can trade more like gold when beta goes down then more like beta,” said McGlone. “And I suspect with a high volatility, it\u0027s still at risk of a decent drawdown.”\nTo find out more about how this Bitcoin halving may play out differently than previous ones, check out the full video on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!","tags":["#Bitcoin","#Blockchain","#Bitcoin Price","#Bitcoin Analysis","#Bitcoin Mining","#Halving","#Bitcoin Halving","#Supply","#Hash Rate","#Total Supply"],"author":"by Marco Castrovilli","creation_date":"2024-04-16"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchains-role-in-modern-industries-interview-with-venom-blockchain","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Delving into the capabilities of advanced digital infrastructure, this platform aims to facilitate transformative changes across the blockchain technology landscape.","title":"Blockchain’s role in modern industries — Interview with Venom Blockchain","detailed_content":"The crypto and Web3 ecosystem continues to expand, requiring platforms that can handle the surge in demand for decentralized applications (DApps) and digital governance. Venom Blockchain aims to meet this challenge, offering a scalable and secure infrastructure that supports a wide array of applications from Web3 development to the creation of fiat-backed stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nLeading the project is Venom Blockchain CEO Christopher Louis Tsu, a seasoned entrepreneur with a rich history in technology innovation, from Apple Computer to biotechnology. In this interview, Tsu offers insights on Venom’s technological contributions to blockchain’s future and its role in fostering broader adoption across various industries.\nCointelegraph: What is your take on the current state of the crypto and Web3 ecosystem?\nChristopher Louis Tsu: I’ve been involved in the ever-evolving tech industry and Web3 for quite some time now, witnessing a remarkable shift in the attitude toward this sector. Jokes aside, even mainstream media quit calling it a bubble backed by thin air.\nCurrently, we’re on the cusp of an unprecedented era in which technology is poised to weave its way intricately into the fabric of society like never before. The surge in trust, investment and alliances with governmental and corporate entities is painting an exciting new landscape burgeoning with possibilities.\nCT: What kind of new opportunities does the market present for blockchain companies?\nCLT: On-chain data highlights the dominance of USD-based stablecoins in transactions, with Tether\nUSDT\n$1.00\nand USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\nprevailing. You can also notice the explosive growth of stablecoins in an incredibly short period. Equally impactful is asset tokenization. Tracking the evolution of both over the years, I’d say they are like two canaries in a coalmine telling us distributed ledger technology is here to stay and will reach many parts of our lives gradually and then suddenly.\nStablecoins and tokenization are sides of the same coin (no pun intended), highlighting the elimination of unnecessary friction in payment settlements. Certainly, it heralds a new transformative era where financial innovations drive broader social changes.\nCT: What are the key features of the Venom blockchain?\nCLT: When it comes to key features, Venom steps in with Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM), Mesh Network protocol, account abstraction and Dynamical Sharding, which seamlessly integrates interchain communication, enabling horizontal and vertical scaling up to 100,000 transactions per second and beyond, while its Threaded-Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm ensures faster and more secure consensus, with high-speed block finality time and low transaction costs.\nAn example of how the Mesh Network protocol works. Source: Venom Blockchain\nWith an already built-in account abstraction feature, Venom Blockchain provides wider authentication options beyond private key ownership, where every account is a smart contract with its own code, and there is no concept of externally owned accounts.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nCT: Who developed the Venom blockchain? Could you share the team’s experience and goals with the development process?\nCLT: The allure of crypto lies in its open-source nature and software composability, allowing us to enhance what the market already offers in something truly remarkable. Here, the Venom team plays a pivotal role, bringing a wealth of experience to the desk. Spanning the spectrum of collective expertise with a particular focus on management and business development, our current strategic goal is to foster the long-term growth of the blockchain as a lasting product. Notably, our track record speaks volumes, with the flawless launch of the Venom blockchain and the successful operation of multiple Venom ecosystem DApps in the current market.\nCT: What makes Venom different than a standard layer 1 blockchain?\nCLT: Overall, the crypto world, in terms of blockchains, is divided into two parts: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM blockchains. Venom stands out as a TVM blockchain, a non-EVM asynchronous blockchain in which transactions are executed simultaneously, contrasting with synchronous blockchains where transactions occur one by one.\nWith key aspects such as account abstraction, Dynamic Sharding and the Mesh Network protocol, which ensures faster transaction speeds and reliable message delivery, new opportunities emerge for finance and government solutions, such as CBDCs, fiat-backed stablecoins and the tokenization of real-world assets. This includes the possibility of creating new networks with autonomous control over their economics and gas metrics.\nHow Venom Blockchain’s network layer works. Source: Venom Blockchain\nNevertheless, it provides flexible opportunities for Web3 DApps and developers, with our Solidity-like programming language, Threaded-Solidity (T-Sol), easing the onboarding process for new developers on Venom Blockchain.\nCT: Why do you think there’s a need for such infrastructure?\nCLT: Institutions and individuals require a blockchain solution capable of scaling to achieve mass adoption without compromising speed or increasing fees. The Venom blockchain’s infrastructure not only offers business opportunities but also empowers governments to harness blockchain technology without relinquishing control.\nThe applicability of this technology opens even broader potential for developing countries as they can tokenize real-world assets such as minerals, forests and carbon credits. For instance, banking services can leverage blockchain to establish micro-lending protocols for small farmers and promote financial inclusion for the unbanked. Additionally, there are cost reductions associated with cross-border transactions.\nCT: Could you share Venom’s plans regarding partnerships, events and integrations?\nCLT: Firstly, we’re launching a TokenForge Hackathon with a prize pool of $200,000, alongside other ecosystem incentive programs, to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build on the Venom blockchain. In addition, we are actively pursuing business-to-government (B2G) deals in Eastern African countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), aiming to establish strategic partnerships that leverage blockchain technologies to address local challenges and drive economic development.\nWe’re exploring opportunities for wholesale banking deals to streamline financial services and promote inclusion, as well as initiating carbon credit-related deals to contribute to environmental sustainability. This reflects our commitment to driving meaningful impact and growth across various sectors through strategic partnerships and integrations.\nCT: Where do you position Venom in the crypto-native world of Web3?\nCLT: With the Venom blockchain bearing the role of an essential medium connecting corporations and Web3, its position will always be in the middle, adopting a two-pronged strategy:\nIn the short term, our focus is on attracting developers to explore the TVM and develop projects on Venom. To catalyze the snowball effect, we’re fostering talents and generating projects that drive increased on-chain activity.\nHowever, our primary strength lies in collaborating with sovereign nations to integrate blockchain technology into various facets of the operation. This extends beyond initiatives like CBDCs or tokenization, we are engaged in substantial governmental projects with broad discussions already underway.\nCT: How do you envision the future of the digital landscape?\nCLT: The rapid growth of the crypto space is surpassing human understanding, potentially leading corporations to dismiss managers who don’t act swiftly on crypto projects. Legal arbitrage is already in motion, with prime locations for crypto development including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands.\nRegulatory hurdles remain the main barrier to progress, prompting countries to compete for talent by offering favorable conditions. As talent relocates, countries will endeavor to attract crypto projects back to their jurisdictions. I see this as the real race will begin approximately two to three years from now.\nLearn more about Venom Blockchain\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#Environment\n#Stablecoin\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

Powered by Phemex, the timeline allows crypto community members to explore and look back at the important events that shaped the industry into what it is today.\nIn the tumultuous landscape of the digital age, where trends come and go at the speed of a click, one phenomenon has risen to prominence like few others: nonfungible tokens (NFTs). The years 2020 and 2021 marked a period of unprecedented growth and widespread adoption of these digital assets, reshaping the way we perceive ownership, art and the internet itself. In fact, in 2021 alone, the NFT market saw approximately $25 billion in trading volume, compared to an almost non-existent metric just a few years prior.\nWhile the concept of blockchain technology had been around for over a decade, the emergence of NFTs captured the imagination of both creators and collectors. NFTs represent unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, ensuring their scarcity and authenticity. This innovation allowed for the tokenization of digital art, music, videos and even tweets, turning intangible creations into valuable commodities.\nThe concept of NFTs can be traced back to at least 2012 when the Colored Coins protocol was created on the Bitcoin blockchain. This protocol allowed users to issue custom tokens representing digital or physical assets. However, it wasn’t until later, with the emergence of Ethereum smart contracts and the ERC-271 token standard in 2017, that nonfungible tokens specifically for digital assets became possible.\nOne of the earliest and most notable examples of NFTs gaining widespread attention in 2017 was CryptoKitties. Developed by Canadian studio Axiom Zen, CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based virtual game that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell virtual cats. Following the success of CryptoKitties, numerous other projects began experimenting with NFTs for various purposes, including digital art, virtual real estate, in-game items and more. Platforms like Decentraland and NBA Top Shot gained traction during this period, showcasing the diverse applications of NFTs beyond gaming.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nThen, between 2020 and 2021, mainstream adoption exploded.\nNFTs reached new levels of mainstream recognition in 2021 as high-profile sales made headlines, including digital artwork selling for millions of dollars and celebrities launching their own NFT collections. In one such case, on Nov. 2, 2021, award-winning writer and director Quentin Tarantino announced he would auction off seven uncut scenes from Pulp Fiction as NFTs, built on the Secret Network. \nOther sales, too, mesmerized headlines, such as the $69 million sale of Beeple’s digital artwork “Everyday: The First 5,000 Days” at Christie’s auction house in March 2021. Newly created digital artworks by artists like Pak and Grimes fetched millions of dollars in auctions and private sales upon inception. During this time, iconic collections, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, were also born.\nEach being a part of a 10,000 algorithmically generated profile pictures collection, in March 2021, a CryptoPunk NFT (#7804) sold for over $7.5 million at auction, marking one of the highest prices paid for a single CryptoPunk at the time. Following this milestone, in October 2021, a rare triple Bored Ape set, consisting of three apes sold as a bundle, fetched over $24 million at a Sotheby’s auction. At the same time, the number of NFT marketplaces expanded rapidly during this period. Platforms such as OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation and Nifty Gateway gained widespread popularity, providing avenues for creators to mint and sell their digital assets. OpenSea emerged as one of the largest NFT marketplaces, with monthly trading volumes surpassing $1 billion by mid-2021, a figure since overtaken by Blur and OKX NFT.\nHowever, this surge in popularity also brought criticism regarding environmental concerns due to the energy-intensive nature of blockchain transactions, as well as questions about the intrinsic value of digital assets. Indeed, during the crypto winter of 2022–2023, the trading volume of NFTs fell by a staggering 99% from its 2021 peak. \nLegal disputes also emerged over the ownership and authenticity of digital assets, highlighting the need for clear regulations and guidelines. Some platforms implemented verification mechanisms to authenticate the originality of NFTs and protect creators’ rights, while others grappled with defining ownership in decentralized ecosystems. Indeed, following the widespread publicity of the Pulp Fiction NFTs, Miramax sued the Hollywood director in a copyright lawsuit that was settled in September 2022. Yuga Labs, the current owner of both the BAYC and CryptoPunks series, also faced similar legal battles over its digital collections. \nYet, all was not lost; with the ongoing crypto bull market, NFTs trading volume has recovered. New NFT projects, especially in Hong Kong, are surging in popularity, with collections gobbled up shortly after release. New protocols, such as ParaSpace (now Parallel Finance), are developing new tools for the ever-increasing NFT lending market. Meanwhile, new Ethereum token standards, such as ERC-404, seek to fractionalize NFTs and enable their widespread access. \nOverall, the NFT space continues to evolve, with ongoing experimentation in various industries and new platforms emerging to cater to different niches within the NFT ecosystem. Additionally, efforts to address environmental concerns and improve the sustainability of blockchain technology are underway as developers and enthusiasts seek to ensure the long-term viability of NFTs as a form of digital ownership and expression.\nRelated: The different types of NFTs: A beginner’s guide\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nYour go-to source for staying on top of market trends, and emerging artists, and unlocking opportunities in the NFT landscape.

Users began to realize that building on layer-1 had flaws, so developers began exploring layer-2 (L2) strategies to address the bottlenecks of building on layer 1. Although there were already solutions for Bitcoin DeFi using layer 2, most relied on Wrapped Bitcoin or wrapped tokens in general, which made it possible to use BTC across different blockchains.\nHowever, Wrapped Bitcoin and its derivatives required custodians for reserve management, undermining decentralized structures. The model also introduced counterparty risks and additional attack vectors, such as those seen in smart contract breaches on Poly Network, a cross-chain interoperability protocol.\nWrapped BTC may introduce additional possible attack vectors, counterparty risk and concerns about centralization. Source: AtomiqDeFi\nIn response to Bitcoin DeFi challenges, atomic swaps emerged, removing the need for wrapped tokens. Atomic swaps facilitate direct transactions between blockchains while ensuring simultaneous execution.\nOvercoming Bitcoin DeFi-related risks\nAs a Bitcoin L2 protocol, Mintlayer is developing the technologies to facilitate atomic swaps. Additionally, AtomiqDeFi, the first project incubated by Mintlayer, is developing a suite of decentralized applications (DApps) using Mintlayer’s atomic swap technology. These DApps will include the world’s first Atomic-Swap-powered decentralized exchange (DEX) on Bitcoin. Charlie Shrem, founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, expressed his excitement regarding the project, stating:\n“Exploring the frontiers of Bitcoin DeFi, Atomiq DeFi\u0027s DEX and its atomic swaps technology is nothing short of revolutionary. It\u0027s like we\u0027re opening a new chapter in the saga of blockchain evolution. Being one of the early believers in Bitcoin and Mintlayer, I can\u0027t help but feel a surge of excitement seeing our path now merging with the groundbreaking efforts of Atomiq DeFi. It\u0027s a thrilling time to be part of this journey.”\nAtomiqDeFi is building an ecosystem of tools, including a launchpad, a decentralized exchange (DEX), an end-user-focused wallet and a cross-chain bridge, all powered by the Mintlayer protocol.\nOne of the ecosystem’s products is the Atomiq DEX, which will be implemented in phases and allows users to trade Mintlayer-based tokens and BTC directly from their wallets. The first version of Atomiq DEX will enable same-chain atomic swaps. Later stages will allow the exchange of BTC and stablecoins for Mintlayer’s native token ML and assets that support Mintlayer standards. Lester Lim, founder of X21 Digital, praised Atomiq DeFi’s DEX, saying:\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\n“The introduction of Atomiq DeFi’s atomic swap-powered DEX marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. It’s a testament to the innovative spirit driving the DeFi space and a clear sign that Bitcoin’s untapped potential is finally being realized.”\nMintlayer offers the Atomiq Pad for initiatives looking to launch projects within the ecosystem. The platform assists projects seeking early-stage liquidity and offers token distribution as a solution to help kickstart their communities. It also aims to be compatible with the Lightning Network, an L2 payment channel for scalable transactions.\nBeyond AtomiqPad, the ecosystem hosts a noncustodial wallet called the Atomiq Wallet, which will support multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. With the wallet app, users gain complete control over their digital assets, including the ability to stake tokens to benefit, participate in governance and access DApps.\nThe Atomiq Bridge marks a strategic expansion for the team, aiming to boost the ecosystem by enabling easy transactions between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains. The project is pursuing partnerships with bridge providers like Layer0 and Wormhole to help speed up integration with the Mintlayer protocol.\nFunded and comprised of Bitcoin industry experts\nAt the helm of Atomiq DeFi is Zaid Ismail, who is transitioning out from his role as the chief operating officer of Mintlayer to the founder and CEO of Atomiq DeFi. Zaid’s journey from AI-driven healthcare innovation in New Zealand to working on enterprise automation platforms laid the foundation for his role in blockchain technology. Under his leadership, Atomiq DeFi became the first project to receive $1.5 million from the Mintlayer Ecosystem Fund, marking a step toward unlocking Bitcoin’s DeFi capabilities.\nAtomiq DeFi secured its lead investor, X21 Digital, during a $3 million seed round that is closing soon. The current seed round includes prominent venture capital firms, such as NXGen, Dutch Crypto Investors (DCI Capital), Spicy Capital, Altcoin Buzz and the AlphaBit fund run by Liam Robertson. Additionally, Atomiq DeFi’s advisory board gains insights from Lester Lim of X21 and Charlie Shrem of the Bitcoin Foundation, who aim to help steer the project to success.\nAs Atomiq DeFi gears up for its next phase, the project is in advanced discussions with tier 1 launchpads — with announcements on the horizon. The Bitcoin DeFi space is tight, and Atomiq DeFi decided to collaborate in strategic partnerships with projects including SatoshiSync, Portal and OrdinalsBot, further enriching the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nBitcoin-centric DeFi ecosystem fund\nIn addition to powering AtomiqDeFi’s growth, Mintlayer Ecosystem Fund offers an incubator, accelerator and grants programs for Bitcoin-centric DeFi projects. The typical grants range from $50,000 to $200,000, although some larger grants can be given to incubated projects like Atomiq DeFi. Mintlayer founder Enrico Rubboli remarked on their trust in Atomiq DeFi, stating:\n“We’re incredibly proud to have Atomiq DeFi as the first project incubated by the Mintlayer Ecosystem Fund, and trust that under Zaid Ismail’s guidance, we’re set to revolutionize Bitcoin DeFi, offering true interoperability with Bitcoin through atomic swaps and offering a truly decentralized way to exchange Bitcoin with any kind of asset issued on Mintlayer.”\nThe fund strategically supports projects that bring new and unique offerings to the ecosystem. Guiding newly developing projects through incubation programs and helping to grow and scale proven projects with its accelerator program, Mintlayer aims to empower the Bitcoin DeFi sector.\nCarrying forward Mintlayer’s future vision, AtomiqDeFi argues that while DApp developers mostly prefer Ethereum, it is time for Bitcoin to take the DeFi crown. AtomiqDeFi plans to be listed on various crypto exchanges following the token generation event, and negotiations are ongoing.\nWith support from Mintlayer, AtomiqDeFi is paving a new path for Bitcoin in the DeFi space and also lays the groundwork for a more interconnected and decentralized financial ecosystem. New collaborations may unlock the untapped potential of the Bitcoin blockchain and shape the future of DeFi based on the original cryptocurrency.\nLearn more about Mintlayer and AtomiqDeFi\n#Bitcoin\n#Blockchain\n#DApps\n#DeFi\n#Layer2\nDisclaimer.

There’s a team of engineers across different core contributor groups working on building the Solana network, and sometimes, they don’t quite get it right,” Federa explained.\nSolana Foundation strategy lead Austin Federa (left) with Gareth Jenkinson (right) at Paris Blockchain Week.\nAccording to the foundation’s strategy lead, Solana’s consensus layer continues to operate as designed, but there is agreement that the network is not living up to expectations from a user experience perspective.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\n“It’s running at about 700 transactions per second now, which is still pretty commendable, even in the sort of degraded state the network is in now. But a lot of work still needs to be done on the Solana core protocol,” Federa said.\nNetwork developers have been planning fixes to “bottleneck” issues in a specific component of its networking stack implementation.\nHowever, the roadmap for implementing upgrades and expected demand on the Solana network “did not line up,” said Federa, adding:\n“The charitable view of this is a failure of success. There’s massive demand for the Solana block space, and there’s a huge demand for the network. It’s processing more transactions than Ethereum’s layer 1 and layer 2s combined.”\nFedera conceded that a less charitable reading of the situation suggests a failure to plan and implement network upgrades. He added that ecosystem developers may have been able to anticipate the sort of demand spikes based on the network’s past usage.\nRelated: Solana devs target April 15 for failed TX fix — It’s ‘not a design flaw’\nAs previously reported, Solana developers aimed to implement a fix for an “implementation bug” that recently caused the transaction failure rate on Solana to skyrocket. Federa said engineers had “not been sleeping much” as they readied patches and tested features before they hit mainnet:\n“It has been an ecosystem effort to identify the problem, potential solutions, and short-term and long-term improvements to the network.”\nSome protocols should have a beta label\nSolana has copped criticism for network outages over the past two years, with the blockchain going down for short periods of time. However, the layer 1 is not the only protocol that has grappled with downtimes, with Ethereum layer-2s Base, Arbitrum and Starknet having experienced issues in recent months.\nFedera said that emerging blockchain networks are still in a growth phase, drawing comparisons to the early days of Amazon Web Services and the outages it experienced. Nevertheless, the blockchain industry is being closely scrutinized, and Federa said expectations are not unfounded:\n“I think it’s appropriate to be upset about downtimes and outages. The goal is 100% uptime, and that should be the goal for the whole industry. If that comes at the expense of no scale, that’s not necessarily the best trade-off.”\nFedera also highlighted various layer-2 protocols’ downtime and outages as an indicator that the industry is still developing and growing. This is part of the reason why Solana still operates under a beta label.\n“The beta tag is honest. The network today does not represent the final form of what developers hope it will be in the future, and there might be other networks that probably should also append a ‘beta’ tag to them,” Federa said.\nSolana released v1.17.31 for general use by mainnet validators on April 15.

This is particularly relevant in a world increasingly concerned with AI-generated content.\nAI: Empowering writers, not replacing them\nAccessible AI has become more mainstream over the last year, and it has been integrated into companies’ business operations in almost every industry worldwide. \nHowever, authors have already had their gripes with the technology making alleged illegal use of their work. In July, author Sarah Silverman sued Meta and OpenAI for using copyrighted work to train their AI systems without permission.\nIn September 2023, a similar lawsuit was filed by the Author’s Guild against OpenAI, alleging misuse of copyrighted material in training of its AI models.\nHowever, Nasisi stressed that AI can be used as a tool for authors, not to replace or exploit them or their work. \n“We never want to have an AI that is writing the story for a writer.”\nHe said that they designed Booksie’s AI bot integration to aid writers who provide feedback on fiction and non-fiction works.\nThe disruptive duo of blockchain and AI\nWhen looking at the combined potential of blockchain and AI, Nasisi said the two will “fundamentally change” how the publishing industry functions over the next 10 years.\nHe said he envisions a future where “writers will combine their creativity with AI and blockchain to create entire worlds in multiple mediums and interact with fans in novel ways.”\nThis future could involve authors leveraging AI assistance to write a book, then utilizing blockchain to create a limited-edition version, a video series, a game based on the story’s world and accompanying merchandise — all while maintaining ownership and transparency throughout the process.\nThe impact of this technological convergence extends far beyond publishing. Nasisi highlights other industries ripe for disruption.\n“AI is changing how higher education teaches while blockchain will provide the authenticity of learning via credentials.”\nHe likens the two technologies to yin and yang, feeding off each other and creating a new paradigm.\nBooksie and its partner, Chainletter Labs, are actively working toward this vision. Nasisi concluded, “The publishing industry will never be the same.”\nWith blockchain and AI at the helm, self-publishing is poised to empower authors like never before, creating a future filled with exciting new possibilities for creators and readers alike.\nMagazine: AI didn’t kill the metaverse, it will build it — Alien Worlds, Bittensor vs Eric Wall: AI Eye\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nYour go-to source for staying on top of market trends, and emerging artists, and unlocking opportunities in the NFT landscape.

The cluttered and scattered crypto landscape complicates navigation for seasoned investors and newcomers.\nThis fragmentation is more than a navigational nuisance; it hinders crypto’s broader adoption and understanding. A recent Forbes study shows that 12% of users want to enter the crypto space but have no idea where to start. Users find themselves wrestling with a quartet of challenges that steepen the learning curve and compound the risks and inefficiencies inherent in digital asset management:\nInefficiency: Crypto enthusiasts often juggle multiple accounts across various platforms, each with its distinct user interface and procedural quirks. The time and effort required to manage assets in such a dispersed setting can be daunting, turning what should be a streamlined process into a cumbersome chore.\nComplexity: The inherent complexity of the crypto space, magnified by its fragmented nature, creates a formidable barrier for newcomers.\nLack of transparency: With digital assets scattered across numerous platforms, achieving a comprehensive view of one’s investments becomes a Herculean task.\nRisk management: Effective risk management is predicated on a clear and holistic understanding of one’s investment portfolio. The fragmented state of the crypto ecosystem complicates this endeavor, making it challenging for investors to gauge their overall exposure and adjust their strategies accordingly.\nAll in all, there is a clear need for a unified solution to address these key challenges while making crypto accessible to the mainstream.\nUnified crypto experience\nCeDeFiAi, also known as CDFI.AI, addresses the fragmentation in the crypto market by providing a unified platform where users can find a wide range of crypto products and services on a single interface.

In the vein of DOTA, different champions combine well with certain classes and specs and counter the figurines chosen by opponents in turn-based matches.\nUbisoft and Oasys, the gaming blockchain protocol on which the former has built the title, gave visitors in Paris a first-hand look at the gameplay. They also announced a new whitelist that will enable prospective players to begin crafting figurines for their champions roster.\nPouard added Ubisoft was not necessarily interested in releasing a game that was driven by financial motivations, but to prove that the studio could release a quality Web3 game that gives players true ownership of digital assets.\n“We must understand the market and how we launch this kind of game,” he said. “That’s really what we want to achieve here. We want to give the players the power to populate the game with figurines and understand what it means to own your gaming assets.”\nOasys also announced a new integration with the omni-chain interoperability protocol LayerZero. This marks a significant step in the former’s 2024 Dragon Update, which focuses on enhancing interoperability across its gaming ecosystem.\nMagazine: ‘Web3 Gaming sucks’ says Ava, 2M Bitcoin Miner players make 13c: Web3 Gamer\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Transitioning blockchains from their isolated nature toward a more interoperable framework presents significant hurdles, necessitating solutions that concurrently address privacy, security and scalability.\nExisting blockchains are either fully transparent or fully anonymous, and neither solves the trust problem. The standard transaction output of layer-1 protocols is limited, with the original blockchain processing only seven transactions per second. Moreover, L1s are not designed to be interoperable by themselves.\nDeveloped by a group of well-known scientists with 35 years of research and 15 years of practical implementation experience, Partisia Blockchain is designed to tackle these issues and become a sustainable ecosystem that enhances building opportunities for developers.\nSolving the current challenges in blockchain L1s\nPartisia Blockchain is an interoperable messaging protocol that aims to solve the 3 biggest challenges in the blockchain space via the unique features it offers. The protocol employs a scalable sharding architecture, customizable multiparty computation (MPC) and tokenomics that allow for paying gas with other tokens than its native token.\nCreated by the project’s co-founder Ivan Damgård, who is also the inventor of Merkle-Damgard hash construction used in Bitcoin\nBTC\n$62,997\n, customizable MPC offers an auditable privacy layer on top of which private data are computed. By allowing the processing of data without knowledge, it ensures the reliability and authenticity of the computation while preserving privacy. The zero-knowledge (ZK) variant technology enables a trust system that helps tokens, both transparent and anonymous, to thrive.\nIts sharding architecture provides an opportunity for multiple blockchains to work independently but simultaneously. The messaging layer facilitates state synchronization by carrying transaction information from one blockchain to another. Whenever there is a need for additional output, a new block may easily be created, thus providing true horizontal scalability.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nVarious blockchains within the Partisia ecosystem are rendered interoperable owing to its gas mechanism. Liquid tokens of different blockchains can be used to pay for gas on Partisia, enabling wider interaction opportunities.\nThe integration of liquid tokens allows for the development of a unique staking model. MPC, Partisia Blockchain’s token that has recently been listed on multiple exchanges, functions as a governance and collateralization token within the blockchain. Users that are eager to participate in blockchain governance stake MPC and earn staking rewards in return. Stakers may opt to be rewarded both in the blockchain’s native currency and other liquid tokens that are used for gas payment, such as ETH, MATIC, BNB and prominent stablecoins, including USDC and USDT.\nFurthermore, MPC is also used to provide protection for the ecosystem. On Partisia Blockchain, users may facilitate various transactions ranging from consensus and ZK computation to token bridging by using MPC as collateral.\nEnabling developers to create unique applications in the Web3 space\nThrough these value propositions, Partisia Blockchain empowers the creation of unique applications in the Web3 space that are currently not possible in other chains. The situation is evident in Partisia Blockchain’s current ecosystem map.\nPartisia Blockchain’s ecosystem map. Source: Partisia Blockchain\nFrom unique Web3 applications like privatized DAOs, secret auctions enabling DEXs to be front-run resistant, auditable e-cash, privatized verifiable supply chains, RWA with privacy features and improved DID to traditional institutional applications like privatized healthcare data analysis, whistleblower solutions and unbiased RNG, Partisia Blockchain has the potential to allow developers to create solutions that could transform or disrupt existing market places.\nPartisia Blockchain announced a 100 million MPC token ecosystem grant program with the goal of fostering innovation.

Specifically, the firm opens short derivative positions when it receives long-position collateral assets for minting USDe.

Users crave immersive and rewarding connections. The gap between digital identities and their impact on real-world benefits also hinders the potential of online commerce.\nJoining the digital with real life\nIn this digital landscape widely criticized for lacking engagement and tangible applicability, a new and exciting approach is paving the way for truly meaningful online interactions. This is Metropolis: a platform where digital collectibles unlock access to real-world rewards.\nThe Metropolis team envisions a future where the boundaries between the digital and physical worlds are dynamic, “where commerce, culture and entertainment converge seamlessly.” Their goal is to create an aesthetic-forward, next-generation cultural destination that is “entirely interoperable and accessible across a multitude of virtual and physical portals.” They are now gearing up for a token launch.\nMetropolis blends elements of commerce, gaming, SocialFi, art and culture. In this ecosystem, users can craft encompassing 360° experiences. At the core of this ecosystem lies a gamified marketplace called Metropolis X.

Together, Metropolis’ collaborators reach more than 300 million people.\nMetropolis is also participating in the Cointelegraph Accelerator. It has already demonstrated significant traction — 15-30% weekly revenue growth and an average spend of $18 per user. Metropolis has been dubbed “the StockX of blockchain” because it simplifies blockchain technology through an intuitive user interface that caters to a broad audience ranging from newcomers to veterans. What makes Metropolis even more accessible is a white-label software-as-a-service solution that enables companies and brands to seamlessly integrate into the digital realm. The platform has raised $1.2 million from a diverse group of stakeholders, including Outlier Ventures, Primal Capital, the chairman of the Tate, founders of Virgin Gaming, the ex-chairman of Deutsche Bank, Cointelegraph Accelerator and Lamina1.\nExpanding the ecosystem: Questing platform and 3D avatars\nIn Metropolis, a questing platform integrates the City and its marketplace through a series of quests and missions.\nMetropolis avatars will also be usable in other virtual worlds. Source: Metropolis\nFurthermore, Metropolis is developing fully interoperable 3D avatars that will be released soon. These avatars, designed for use both within Metropolis and across other virtual worlds, promise to offer a seamless and personalized digital experience.\nMetropolis’ roadmap charts an ambitious path in four phases toward a fully integrated digital ecosystem. Phase 1 introduces a questing platform featuring AI-powered lore quests and gaming commerce with real-life rewards. These features will leverage CLAY tokens for leveling up. In Phase 2, the focus shifts to 3D avatars, allowing users to create avatars for use across various platforms, including V-tubing capabilities, augmented reality (AR) experiences, custom filters and game integrations. Metropolis employs the ethos of “Build with us. Take anywhere.”\nPhase 3 further expands the virtual environment, introducing fully customizable property hubs and immersive 3D streets, which feel like extensions of social media profiles. Finally, Phase 4 comprises the development of ‘Future Cities,’ including the designed-to-scale City of Fire, Pixel, Earth, Space and Water, supported by a plug-and-play back end.\nMetropolis seeks to become more than an ecosystem. It stands as a blueprint for the future of Web3 — a future that is immersive, inclusive and interconnected. A visionary approach lays the groundwork for a world where the boundaries between the virtual and the real are blurred to redefine the common understanding of community, identity and engagement in the digital age.\nMetropolis is preparing for an upcoming launch on the PAID Network’s Ignition IDO platform, aiming to introduce new developments that will contribute to the platform’s 360° digital experience. The initiative welcomes public participation and is scheduled for April 16-17, starting at 11:00 am UTC.\nLearn more about the upcoming launch and Metropolis’ ecosystem here\n#Blockchain\n#Marketplace\n#Metaverse\n#Ecosystem\n#Web3\n#NFT\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.

However, the Bitcoin network is not controlled by miners, but by node operators, he stressed, adding:\n“Bitcoin was not made for the miners, but for the hodlers.”\nWould it be possible to scrap halving?\nLike any change to Bitcoin, it is theoretically possible to do away with the halving if you have a hard fork.\nHowever, most think it would be “next to impossible” to reach the consensus required to make the change, while others, such as argues that the resulting product, by design, won’t be Bitcoin anymore.\n“It would break one of the key features that every Bitcoiner loves about Bitcoin: it will have less supply inflation than gold, and continue that deflationary trend,” Bitcoin ESG researcher Daniel Batten told Cointelegraph.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

What will be the case in 10 years and more is another matter and nobody has an answer to that.”\nSome miners may support the idea of eliminating halvings but full nodes may not, and nodes have significant control over the Bitcoin network, according to New Layer Capital’s general partner Nicholas Safford.\n“If a group of miners wanted to implement such a proposal, they would need to hard fork the Bitcoin network, after which point, the new cryptocurrency would cease to be Bitcoin,” he stated.\nMiners fear the halving, but they don’t hate it\nBitcoin halvings have been historically associated with bullish sentiment as BTC prices surged to new all-time highs after halvings. However, there’s also a fear that the halving would raise the operational costs of mining Bitcoin, hurting profitability.\nOn the halving date, for a miner whose cost of mining 1 BTC was $35,000 per BTC, the cost would suddenly increase overnight to $70,000 per BTC, New Layer Capital’s Safford explained.\nMiner revenue after halvings.

But I would still not bet on any dramatic changes like changing the 21 million cap or removing halvings altogether,” Csepcsar told Cointelegraph.

With the addition of zkSync, USDC is now supported on 16 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum and others. \nZero-knowledge proofs determine the integrity of a transaction without disclosing the supporting evidence. Meanwhile, rollups bundle transactions off the Ethereum main layer and club them into a single transaction. Together, they form the core of the zkSync technology, which processes transactions at record speed and low cost at layer 2 and sends the finalized proof back to the Ethereum mainnet.

On one side, service providers stake collateral to offer various execution services. On the other, developers utilize the platform to meet users’ needs by efficiently turning specific intents into on-chain results.\nOMS: Security solution for intent-based tasks\nTo enhance efficiency and cover various use cases, dappOS introduces the optimistic minimum stake (OMS) mechanism, which was developed to improve the network’s security for intent-based tasks.\nDappOS builds an intent-based infrastructure to solve scalability and complexity issues. Source: dappOS\nOMS mandates that each task be associated with a predefined value and potential compensation for failure, allowing for the execution of tasks before their outcomes are verified. If a task fails, the network employs a consensus process to slash the responsible service providers, ensuring users are either satisfied by the task’s completion or compensated accordingly.\nDappOS’ OMS system benefits both service providers, who are required to stake only slightly more than the total value of active intent tasks, and users, who enjoy cost-efficient and rapid task execution. The post-task verification process facilitates a decentralized verification strategy, bolstering the network’s efficiency and security in handling diverse use cases.\nWith over 20 corporate projects, including GMX, BENQI and QuickSwap, under its belt, dappOS has garnered a user community of over 350,000 and executed more than 1.5 million transactions.\nAmid a rapidly expanding blockchain ecosystem and its complexities, dappOS offers a solution for streamlined, user-centric blockchain interactions.

Goliath: Small language models challenge Big Tech’s AI giants","detailed_content":"Assisterr targets the monopolization of AI by Big Tech, advocating for data ownership and the democratization of AI through community-owned small language models (SLMs), which offer tailored and efficient solutions.\nThe debate on whether artificial intelligence (AI) poses a global threat often misses a crucial point: the real danger lies not in AI itself but in its potential monopolization by the tech giants — commonly known as Big Tech — and governmental bodies. These powerful entities can misuse AI to subtly shape public perceptions and behaviors to serve their own ends, whether for profit maximization or political control.\nFar from being a dystopian fantasy, this scenario reflects our current reality, demanding immediate intervention. Data ownership lies at the heart of the issues with AI technology. Big Tech has effectively appropriated the collective knowledge of humanity, training their large language models (LLMs) on free information and then locking it behind $20 monthly subscriptions.\nGoogle\u0027s $60 million annual investment for access to Reddit’s treasure trove of user-generated content underscores the disparity between the value created by community contributions and the compensation (or lack thereof) received by those contributors.\nEmpowering communities with small language models\nAgainst this backdrop, Assisterr — a Cambridge-based data layer for decentralized AI — positions itself as a force for change by creating an infrastructure that backs decentralized AI data inference and a network of community-owned SLMs, empowering the very people who feed the data ecosystem.\nAssisterr provides a data infrastructure layer for small language models.

This includes crucial details like soil moisture, pH content, and humidity.”\nHe said this information allows farmers to make “data-driven decisions” to optimize crop health and yields. Meanwhile, the DePIN system allows consumers to access information about the food they purchase:\n“This could include details about the farm’s practices, the origin of the food, and how it was grown. It empowers consumers to make informed choices about the food they put on their tables.”\nRelated: Weather forecasting for developing regions: Here’s how Web3 can help\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nCurrently, the state of the global food trade highlights the urgent need for change. Farmers, despite being the backbone of the industry, often receive a disproportionately low share of the value captured in the market.\nScaling for the world\nAccording to Farmsent, it plans to address this by bypassing traditional intermediaries and enabling direct transactions between farmers and consumers and already has over 160,000 farmers onboarded in Indonesia and Colombia.\nThe platform, currently still in beta, is being used to track coffee, avocados and palm sugar between Indonesia, Colombia, the United Arab Emirates — where it already has a license to operate — and the United States. Farmsent said it is currently working on securing three additional licenses.\nShusti said that storing large amounts of data from sensors, farms and partners can become expensive on traditional blockchains:\n“As Farmsent expands its reach to new markets and connects with more farmers and consumers, the volume of data and transactions within the network will inevitably surge.”\nTherefore, he said that Peaq was chosen for its ability to cost-effectively store data and scale at large. The Peaq network has been gaining traction, and it recently secured $15 million in a Series A round led by Generative Ventures and Borderless Capital.\nIn the past, it has worked on DePIN projects alongside major companies such as Bosch and even worked to tokenize 100 Teslas in a decentralized Web3 ride-sharing initiative across Europe.\nData and security \nHandling the transactions and data of farmers and business owners worldwide is not only a big feat for scaling purposes but also in keeping all that information safe and secure. \nAccording to the Farmsent CEO, its DePIN network gathers information from three sources. In one, it is entered by humans and then validated. Information on farm practices, harvest details and initial processing can be manually entered by authorized personnel and validated for accuracy.\nIt can also be collected through Internet of Things (IoT) sensors placed throughout the supply chain (farms, storage facilities, transport) that can continuously monitor conditions like temperature, humidity and freshness.\nLastly, data is procured from third-party partners like logistics companies that provide data relevant to transport and storage conditions.\nTo keep this data secure, Shusti told Cointelegraph that Farmsent leverages Peaq decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enhance data privacy further:\n“DIDs act like unique identifiers on the blockchain that can be linked to data without revealing the actual data itself. ”\nHe said that this allows for data verification and controlled access while protecting sensitive information.\nTill Wendler, the co-founder of Peaq, said this use case within the agriculture industry is not just exciting but also one of the “most important ones” due to its promise to push back global food insecurity and “deliver cheaper and more quality produce to people around the world” — and in a secure manner. \nMagazine: Memecoins make millionaires, Terraform and Do Kwon liable for fraud, and more: Hodler’s Digest, March 31 – April 6\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Top performers receive benefits like airdropped Data NFTs from past and future data creators, boosts on monthly Itheum Trailblazer quest rewards and future perks such as giveaways and merchandise.\nTo acquire BiTz, users must possess a BiTz-compatible Data NFT in their wallet, enabling them to participate in the “Get ” game. Initially, these Data NFTs were distributed to early supporters of the Itheum Protocol through airdrops. However, users who didn’t receive the airdrops can purchase BiTz-compatible Data NFTs on various NFT marketplaces.\nTo engage in the game, which is playable every 6 hours (reduced to 3 hours during the launch window), users are required to “burn” a meme as an offering to the BiTz Generator God. Whether users win BiTz is determined by chance following the meme sacrifice.\nBeyond playing the Get BiTz game, users will soon be able to earn BiTz points by engaging with the Itheum Protocol. Activities like exploring and marking favorites among Data NFTs and Data Creators via the Data DEX, utilizing Data Uptime Checks or embedding Data Widgets within the Itheum Explorer will earn users extra BiTz points.\nOffering an opportunity to influence BiTz utility and the development of the ecosystem, users are invited to contribute their insights through the suggestion form.\nThrough these initiatives, Cointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum seeks to resolve data ownership and trade challenges in the digital economy and aims to build a secure, inclusive environment for data exchange.

However, integrating blockchain simplifies this by merging them into a single, streamlined confirmation.\nThis could translate to faster and more efficient transactions for everyone involved — the exchange, its members, investors and, most, importantly, issuers raising capital.\nCointelegraph spoke with a representative from Sui to better understand its collaboration with ATHEX and its blockchain being used to level up operations in a traditional finance (TradFi) setting.\nRelated: Wall Street’s new asset class: Will Grayscale survive the Bitcoin ETF era?\nEnhanced security and transparency \nOne of the primary motivators for integrating blockchain into a highly sensitive network — like a stock exchange dealing with billions of dollars on a daily basis — is a significant security boost. \nDigital certificates, inherent to blockchain transactions, provide an advanced layer of security alongside being on a public, immutable ledger, which can help eliminate the risk of manipulation — a persistent challenge in TradFi.\nThis transparency extends to regulatory oversight, allowing regulators to easily monitor trade activities for suspicious behavior. The Sui spokesperson commented:\n“Centralized processes of primary issuance have fallen victim to bad actors in the space for decades and malpractices of non-transparent allocation.”\n“Also having an immutable, public ledger reflecting trades would simplify regulators’ ability to monitor trading activities for suspicious transactions or improper allocations,” they said. \nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

The project aims to enable digital identity verification for Telegram users over the next five years.\nThe project uses HumanCode’s technology to allow users to verify their human identity on the blockchain. The application, available on Google Play and Apple Store, lets users scan their palms on a smartphone.\nAccording to information shared with Cointelegraph, the technology provides privacy protection and is hardware-agnostic, allowing the scanner to be used on various mobile devices.\nTON Foundation growth director Ekin Tuna said that supporting proof-of-personhood protocols like HumanCode is a step toward a practical reputation system with real-life use cases for TON’s ecosystem:\n“A scalable, private, and decentralized identity will help to onboard the first one billion users to the Web3 ecosystem in Telegram.”\nHumanCode founder Tim Zhang told Cointelegraph that the technology securely scans a human palm by extracting the pattern directly onto a user\u0027s smartphone device. \n“This local extraction ensures the pattern is non-reversible, meaning that even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to our server, reconstructing the palm images from the patterns would be impossible,” Zhang explains.\nThe founder added that the system maintains U.S. SOC2 data security and privacy certifications and implements a triple-layer privacy protection mechanism. The first step involves local extraction of the user’s unique palm pattern, preventing personal information from being transferred off the device.\nThe extracted feature is encrypted before being sent to HumanCode servers to secure the data during transmission. The verification process is conducted locally on a user’s device, removing the need to transfer sensitive data to external servers.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nHumanCode incentives will be given to TON Society members who complete a palm scan and prove their personhood. A ‘soulbound\u0027 token is then minted to represent their verified digital identity before users are rewarded for participating.\nCointelegraph also highlighted the reality of increased skepticism for proof-of-personhood technology in conversation with Zhang, given that Worldcoin has received pushback for its iris-scanning technology.\nThe company’s iris-scanning devices and data collection methods have been subject to investigations and regulatory scrutiny in Hong Kong, Spain and France over the past six months. \nA Worldcoin iris-scanning orb on display at ETHGlobal in London in March 2024. Source: Gareth Jenkinson\nZhang said HumanCode’s use of robust security protocols and encryption is an important trust-bridging factor, while suggesting that users might feel less intimidated about scanning their hands instead of their eyes:\n“From our experience, palm recognition technology is inherently more acceptable. For most people, scanning your palm with a smartphone camera just feels less intrusive than eye-scanning.”\nZhang also said the technology can potentially combat bots and fraudulent accounts on any social media platform by verifying the authenticity of users through unique palm patterns.

Studies say that NFT sales are mostly driven by a combination of luck, scarcity and optimism, implying room for improvement to make them more resilient to market conditions.\nUnlike other blockchain-based assets, NFTs have their own challenges on top of the common issues troubling the broader Web3 ecosystem. Despite their popularity and the vast range of uses — from art to gaming to digital identities — NFTs face significant hurdles impacting user experience and adoption.\nKey NFT challenges\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a primary challenge in the NFT market. As seen in the so-called crypto winter, NFTs are much harder to cash out than cryptocurrencies. This is because each NFT offers unique features or utilities, making it harder to find buyers or sellers during a market downturn.\nPrices become more volatile, and the duration for which assets remain unsold extends. The liquidity issues lock existing users’ capital while deterring potential investors’ participation due to asset fluidity concerns.\nFractionalization\nAny crypto user can buy one-thousandth of Bitcoin\nBTC\n$62,992\n, but the same is not true for a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, which usually has a floor price of far above 10 Ether\nETH\n$3,030\n. The lack of fractionalization in NFTs creates a massive barrier for newcomers, especially smaller investors, preventing them from participating in the market.\nTransaction costs\nThe more advanced features NFTs offer, the more complex their transactions become to process. While newly emerging standards can address inherent issues of NFTs, they still suffer from the high gas fees for which the Ethereum Virtual Machine-based networks are infamous.\nIntegration and Composability\nThe unique nature of NFTs makes them a challenge to integrate and add to a platform, even within the Web3 ecosystem. Most platforms and protocols are simply not equipped to handle the transactions and storage of NFTs, preventing NFT holders from enjoying the most common functions of decentralized finance (DeFi), such as lending, borrowing and yield farming.\nLack of control over NFTs\nThere are new standards, such as ERC-404, that aim to merge ERC-20 and ERC-721 qualities, but their approach doesn’t give enough control to users over the fractionalized NFTs they hold. For example, if the tokenholder has fractional ownership of multiple unique NFT artwork, they can’t pick which artwork they want to let go of while trying to sell it on a decentralized exchange (DEX).\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls \u0026 Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nHybrid approach to ERC-20 and ERC-721\nA hybrid approach that combines the strength of the two most common token standards — the ERC-20 and ERC-721 — has the potential to effectively address the NFT challenges, primarily the ones regarding fractionalization and liquidity. While there are already some experiments on the topic, these efforts still need to figure out how to deal with the ever-rising transaction costs of networks based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nThis is where HybridX emerges with its gas-efficient hybrid token, HX, combining the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. The unique blend introduced by HybridX aims to harness the strengths of both standards to offer efficiency and flexibility in the trading and management of digital assets of the broader Web3 ecosystem.\nFractionalized, low-cost NFTs\nThe hybrid HX token model allows for the fractionalization of NFTs to increase market liquidity, enabling users to buy and sell portions of NFT assets. The fractionalized NFTs can potentially become more accessible and appealing as digital asset investments for a wider demographic.\nOn top of addressing the liquidity and fractionalization issues plaguing the NFT market, the first project on HybridX — XDragon — has selected the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) as its infrastructure primarily due to its capabilities that enhance the project’s features. ICP’s on-chain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) allows for the truly random generation of NFT artworks upon conversion from fungible tokens, a contrast to the sequential allocation common in most NFT collections. The on-chain VRF ensures that each NFT acquired is a surprise, enriching the user experience with genuine uniqueness.\nAdditionally, ICP facilitates the on-chain storage of all NFT metadata, a move that eliminates the need for off-chain components and bolsters the security and integrity of the data.\nThe hybrid token model integrates with DeFi and NFT platforms for enhanced composability. NFT holders can leverage their assets through the HX token in various DeFi applications.\nHybridX also offers flexible management of NFT collections. Users can selectively sell or burn assets without being constrained by current standards’ first-in-first-out (FIFO) restrictions. This allows tokenholders to take a strategic approach to their portfolios.\nSeamless switch from fungible token to NFT\nThe innovative approach to NFTs has already established use cases to demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of HX, including the Web3-powered Dragon Eyes dice-rolling game.\nDragon Eyes introduces the XDragon as a switchable NFT to memecoin. Users can shapeshift their fungible EYES token, the reward token of the game, to mint an Xdragon NFT. The game applies a 1% fee distributed back to the NFT holders through pool fee distribution and gamification. The shapeshift fee is directly proportional to the token price, providing fundamental value and utility for XDragon.\nXDragon will be featured in the upcoming global ICPCC event on May 10, which will showcase how ICP technology can be used to enhance decentralized applications on any blockchain.\nXDragon Gamblification Economy\nXDragon collection is designed to be self sustained through gamblification and shapeshift fee distribution.\n\nIn HybridX standard, you can only hold Fungible OR Non-Fungible, unlike like ERC-404.\n\n\"Shapeshift\" is the action to change mode from NFT to… pic.twitter.com/xnho541mTH\n— 🐉 Dragon Eyes 👀 | XDragon 🐲 (@ICDragonEyes) March 13, 2024\nFollowing the release of the HybridX Tools as a user-friendly interface for on-demand minting and burning of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, the HX ecosystem aims to expand with a range of key Web3 milestones. The expansions include exclusive NFTs for HybridX members, the CrossPollinate program for incentivizing ecosystem projects, a launchpad powered by NFTs and a DEX for both fungible and nonfungible tokens.\nAs the blockchain-based internet continues to expand and evolve, HybridX envisions a fluid future of digital assets “where the values are seamlessly discovered and exchanged, fostering innovation and accessibility in the evolving Web3 economy.”\nFind out more about HybridX\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#ERC-20\n#Web3\n#NFT\nDisclaimer.

This allows projects to mirror and grant the transferable rights of the real-world product in token form.\nMullin quickly points out that this is a challenge because every asset class has different real-world rules, which vary by jurisdiction. Depending on where the project operates, it must consider different things, making it a challenging yet rewarding industry and product suite.\n“And I think that in the longer term, tokenization, everything will be tokenized, in my opinion. I think the whole world will be tokenized. My personal perspective is if Web2 was bringing the world online, Web3 is bringing the world on-chain.”\nMullin adds that the tokenization of real-world assets will likely attract more institutional interest than the space has experienced. He adds that RWA tokenization allows institutions to invest on-chain without dealing with unfamiliar and more volatile assets, such as those in decentralized finance.\nTo hear more from John Mullin, listen to the full episode of Hashing It Out on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or TuneIn, and remember to check out Cointelegraph’s full catalog of Web3 podcasts.\nExchange or buy ATOM\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

The discussion revolved around bitsCrunch - a decentralized, AI-powered data network for NFTs and other public chain digital assets recognized by PwC and Ernst \u0026 Young. Its partners include Mastercard, Unstoppable Domains, DappRadar, and other key players in the industry.\nAMA: Unveiling the Future of NFTs with bitsCrunch CEO Vijay Pravin https://t.co/XcthGSwQLs\n— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 25, 2024\nPravin began the interview by elaborating on bitsCrunch’s mission to democratize access to blockchain data: “Blockchain data is quite tricky and not human readable, which is why there are many tools and protocols in the space. We want to make this data accessible to both companies and individual users.\"\nThe platform is already user-friendly: anyone can access Bitscrunch’s data APIs with a valid internet connection and an API key, which can be generated instantly or within 48 hours. \"The moment you get access, you can start querying data, making API calls, and building your own dashboards,\" Pravin continued. “We plan to make the whole experience easier, especially for non-techy people, like adding drag-and-drop interfaces.”\nThe company differentiates itself by offering forensic analysis in addition to traditional analytics. This would involve identifying suspicious activity within the broader blockchain ecosystem, going beyond the NFT focus. \nIn addition, Bitscrunch also offers insights into in-game analytics, providing data on player behavior and in-game asset trading. This type of data can be invaluable to gaming companies looking to understand and target their audience.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nbitsCrunch also has an impressive library of historical data. “Just to give you an example, we can provide prices of up to 250,000 tokens on Ethereum since its inception. Or tell you the price of Chainlink on any given day. Very few players can do that,” Pravin pointed out, comparing to established data providers like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.\nWhen discussing their token BCUT, bitsCrunch also doesn’t go for hype and is more interested in building a functional network. “We believe in slow and steady growth,” the speaker noted. The bitsCrunch network will rely on node operators to distribute the data load, similar to how services like Amazon and Google work. BCUT tokenholders can participate by delegating their tokens to these node operators, which allows them to choose operators who offer the best value to the network.\nThe results have been promising so far. According to Pravin, in just one month, over 4.22 million BCUT tokens have been staked on the Bitscrunch network mainnet. Additionally, 48 leading node operators, including industry heavyweights like 0xFury, Nodes.Guru and Impossible Finance are already contributing to the network. In the near future, staking will be open to the public.\n“We’re big fans of existing solutions like Graph Protocol and Covalent,” Pravin said about the inspiration for the BCUT token. “Such data protocols usually follow Delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) algorithms and sets of node operations. And that’s what we’re going with, we don’t want to reinvent the wheel since it has already been tested on the market. Instead, we want to focus on our core competencies – data analytics, AI, and machine learning,” he added.\nBitscrunch is taking a big step toward DAO status by launching the “Contributor” role. This program allows the community to actively participate in the development of the network and earn perks. “We want the community to come in, contribute, and then be rewarded for their work,” said Pravin. The first opportunity to contribute is through asset labeling, which allows users to identify wallet types and their origins. These labels are then verified internally, and all contributors are rewarded on-chain through a transparent system powered by Chainlink’s oracles.\nThe next step in community engagement is the “Indicator” role. Currently, the Bitscrunch team decides which blockchains to index, which algorithms to use, and which data analytics to share publicly. However, the future vision is for the community to have a say in these decisions.\nThe ultimate goal for bitsCrunch is to be a comprehensive data hub, not just for NFT information, but to be the destination for all things blockchain data. Pravin gave a glimpse of what’s to come, such as the addition of some major blockchains and potential exchange listings. “The next big integration and transition to a more decentralized operator model is exciting,” he concluded.\nLearn more about bitsCrunch\n#Blockchain\n#DAO\n#Games\n#NFT\nDisclaimer.

These systems ensure the free flow of information even in the face of censorship attempts by spreading control among numerous participants and encrypting conversations.\nSystems that are resistant to censorship are essential for maintaining the right to free speech, providing information access in repressive governments, and encouraging creativity by guarding against arbitrary limitations on expression and communication. In the digital age, they are a potent weapon for advancing democracy, human rights and the free flow of ideas.\nHow censorship affects traditional systems\nIn traditional systems, censorship weakens the fundamentals of established institutions by preventing free speech, maintaining disparities in power and warping the course of history.\nFirstly, it restricts the right to free speech, which is essential to many traditional communities. Ideas stagnate when voices are silenced, impeding advancement both intellectually and culturally. Censorship can impede the transfer of knowledge and values from one generation to the next in traditional systems where oral traditions and storytelling are essential, undermining communal cohesiveness.\nFurthermore, censorship frequently perpetuates the power relationships found in established hierarchies. By dictating what information is acceptable, those in positions of power strengthen their hold on the narrative, resulting in the silence of dissident voices, the stifling of critical thought and the maintenance of long-standing disparities.\nIn addition, censorship has the power to skew historical accounts, reshaping perceptions of the past and collective memory. Governments and other institutions can sway public opinion by restricting access to information, hiding uncomfortable facts and promoting a distorted version of events.\nFor instance, a kind of censorship occurred in the 2008 financial crisis when risk experts’ warnings about the dangers associated with subprime mortgage-backed securities were played down or disregarded within financial institutions. This lack of transparency about the actual risks partly caused the bubble in the housing market and its subsequent collapse.\nAnti-censorship features in blockchain\nSeveral anti-censorship capabilities provided by blockchain technology are crucial for maintaining freedom of speech and the transmission of information. \nIt’s crucial to remember that blockchains have limits, even though they have robust anti-censorship capabilities. Governments or other influential organizations may attempt to impose restrictions on network access or even establish more tightly controlled, permissioned blockchains. However, the fundamental structure of blockchains makes them an effective instrument for encouraging free expression and transparent information sharing. \nAnti-censorship features in blockchain include:\nDecentralization\nBlockchains rely on a dispersed network of computers, or nodes, as opposed to conventional systems that have central authorities. This implies that no single party has complete control over the network, which makes it challenging to remove or filter content.\nImmutable ledger\nData entered on the blockchain cannot be removed or changed later. Every link in the chain has a cryptographic hash of the one before it, which prevents manipulation and ensures data integrity. Information censors find it very difficult to influence due to this immutability property.\nTransparency\nAll data and transactions on public blockchains are accessible to all network users. Because of this transparency, attempts at censorship are discouraged because it makes data manipulation obvious.\nEncryption\nStrong cryptographic techniques are frequently used by blockchains to protect communications and transactions. Because of this encryption, data privacy and integrity are ensured, making it more difficult for censors to intercept or alter data without permission.\nThe role of consensus mechanisms in censorship resistance\nConsensus mechanisms are essential for decentralized systems like blockchain networks to be censorship-resistant.\nWithout depending on a central authority, these systems allow participants to mutually agree on the veracity of transactions or information. Consensus techniques make it extremely difficult for a single party to filter or modify data by requiring broad agreement across network nodes.\nFor instance, in proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms, to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain, miners compete to solve challenging cryptography puzzles. Because of the decentralized validation process, censorship is not feasible from an economic or logistical standpoint, as no single entity can control the network.\nSimilarly, distributed decision-making processes are the foundation of proof-of-stake (PoS) and other consensus methods to achieve censorship resistance. Consensus techniques preserve the ideals of decentralization and censorship resistance by allocating power among network users and rewarding integrity, which promotes trust and security in decentralized systems.\nHow Bitcoin achieves censorship resistance\nBitcoin’s decentralized consensus mechanism, pseudonymity and decentralized governance allow it to withstand censorship attempts by any centralized authority and maintain the immutability of its transactions.\nIn the Bitcoin network, miners compete to add transactions to the blockchain and validate them by solving difficult mathematical puzzles. Because the network cannot be controlled by a single party, censorship becomes a challenging endeavor. Any attempt to filter a transaction would have to overwhelm the network’s total processing capacity, which gets more and more difficult as the network grows bigger.\nAn additional degree of censorship resistance is added by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous nature. Because transactions are broadcast to the whole network and documented on a public ledger, everyone can take part without needing authorization. Any centralized authority would find it difficult to selectively ban transactions based on the sender or content because of this transparency.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship is strengthened by its decentralized governance architecture, in which decisions are made by consensus among network users. Modifications to the protocol necessitate wide consensus among participants, making it impervious to censorship efforts by any one person or organization.\nChallenges and future of censorship resistance in blockchain technology\nAlthough blockchain technology is inherently immune to censorship, there are still a number of obstacles that need to be overcome to maintain its effectiveness in the face of evolving threats. \nThe possible centralization of mining power is a major obstacle that threatens the decentralized nature of blockchain if mining gets concentrated in the hands of a small number of strong entities. Nonetheless, the open nature of most PoW systems means anyone can theoretically join the mining process. This creates competition among miners, making it less likely for a single entity to dominate.\nMoreover, censorship resistance faces challenges from legal frameworks and regulatory constraints. Governments may try to control or restrict the use of blockchain technology, which could hinder its capacity to successfully withstand censorship. Adherence to those restrictions may jeopardize the autonomy and decentralization of blockchain networks.\nThe anonymity and privacy provided by blockchain may be threatened by developments in analysis and monitoring technologies. Maintaining anonymity on public blockchains gets harder as monitoring capabilities advance, putting users at risk of censorship and retaliation.\nThe future of censorship-resistant blockchains hinges on privacy-enhancing innovations. Technologies like stealth addresses and zero-knowledge proofs offer robust anonymity and resilience against censorship attempts. However, to fully address these obstacles and ensure blockchain’s enduring resistance, continuous research and development are paramount.","tags":[],"author":"by Jagjit Singh","creation_date":"2024-04-04"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bank-england-fca-launch-digital-securities-sandbox","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The Bank of England and the U.K.’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, aim for the inaugural group of applicants to join the Digital Securities Sandbox by autumn 2024.","title":"Bank of England and FCA launch Digital Securities Sandbox for DLT testing","detailed_content":"The Bank of England (BoE) and the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have started a consultation on the draft guidance for their Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), which is designed to allow participants to test distributed ledger technology (DLT) for trading and settlement of digital securities such as shares and bonds.\nAccording to a joint consultation and draft guidance released on Wednesday, April 3, the sandbox will last five years and could lead to a new regulatory regime for securities settlement.\nSuccessful applicants using the sandbox will be able to provide securities depository and settlement services, as well as operate a trading venue under modified regulations.\nThe BoE and the FCA aim for the inaugural group of applicants to join the DSS by autumn 2024.

These firms offer pre-made phishing kits, editable templates and server infrastructure to create fake web pages.\nA cybercriminal may, for instance, sign up for a PhaaS platform, create an email template that seems like it comes from a respectable crypto exchange, and distribute it to thousands of possible recipients. A link to a fake login page intended to steal users’ credentials might be included in the email. \nCybercriminals may swiftly launch extensive phishing campaigns with PhaaS, posing a greater threat to both individuals and enterprises. The accessibility of PhaaS reduces the entrance barrier for cybercrime, which is a major worry for internet consumers and cybersecurity experts globally.\nHow PhaaS works\nPhaaS makes it easier for fraudsters to start phishing attacks by giving them access to extensive toolkits and infrastructure. \nIt operates as follows:\nPhaaS kits\nPre-packaged phishing kits with all the tools, infrastructure and templates needed to carry out phishing attacks are available from PhaaS suppliers. Email templates, fictitious login pages, domain registration services and hosting infrastructure are all included in these kits.\nCustomization\nThe degree of customization offered by various PhaaS systems varies. Phishing emails, websites and domains may all be altered by con artists to look genuine and trustworthy. Phishing campaigns can be customized to target particular people, businesses or sectors.\nTargeting\nPhishing attacks made possible by PhaaS are getting more complex. Cybercriminals have the ability to design highly targeted advertising campaigns that imitate the branding and communication strategies of reputable companies and their offerings. Attackers can create persuasive communications that have a higher chance of tricking recipients by utilizing personal information gleaned from social media, data breaches and other sources.\nFor instance, attackers often pose as support staff from popular wallets, exchanges or projects on social media (Telegram, Discord, Twitter, etc.). They offer help and trick users via false claims of giveaways or airdrops into giving up private keys or seed phrases or establishing connections with compromised wallets to siphon off their funds.\nDangers of PhaaS\nPhaaS has dramatically reduced the entry barrier for hackers, which has resulted in a discernible rise in the quantity and sophistication of phishing attempts.\nEven those with no technical experience can simply launch complex phishing attacks with PhaaS using pre-packaged toolkits, customizable templates and the hosting infrastructure offered by PhaaS providers.\nThe possibility of suffering a large financial loss is the main risk associated with PhaaS. The goal of phishing scams is to obtain users’ private keys, seed phrases or login credentials. These can be used to access their accounts and drain their cryptocurrency wallets for nefarious purposes. For instance, attackers altered BadgerDAO’s front-end in 2021 after fooling users into providing permissions that let their money be drained.\nPhaaS attacks have the potential to undermine confidence in the crypto community. Scams that are successful can discourage people from using even reputable projects and services, which prevents widespread adoption. These attacks are especially vulnerable to novice cryptocurrency users. They can be more susceptible to falling for social media impersonations or websites that look authentic because they lack experience.\nPhishing attacks are getting more and more complex; they frequently use social engineering strategies and imitate genuine platforms. This makes it challenging for even experienced users to recognize. \nPhaaS is not just for large-scale email campaigns. Spear-phishing attacks are directed at well-known people or companies in the cryptocurrency industry. Such attacks use personalized information to trick specific individuals or organizations into giving up sensitive data or taking actions that lead to financial loss or security breaches.\nHow to defend against PhaaS\nAn ideal way to protect against PhaaS is to practice constant vigilance: Double-check everything (URLs, sender addresses), never click unsolicited links, and never share your private keys or seed phrases.\nMultilayered security approach and technical defenses\nInstall firewalls, network monitoring tools, endpoint security and robust email filtering. These technological safeguards aid in the identification and blocking of risky attachments, phishing emails and questionable network activity.\nUser awareness training\nTeach staff members on a regular basis how to spot and report phishing attempts. Inform them of the typical signs of phishing attempts. This entails instructing people to examine sender addresses closely, determine the urgency of messages, stay away from dubious links, and desist from sending private information over email.\nSecurity policies\nImplement security measures like best practices for passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA). To avoid unwanted access, encourage the use of strong, unique passwords that are updated on a regular basis.\nDMARC implementation\nTo assist in removing spoof emails, make use of email authentication methods such as domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance (DMARC). By assisting in email authenticity verification, DMARC lowers the success rate of phishing attempts.\nIt gives domain owners insights into email authentication statistics on their domain and lets them set policies to handle unauthenticated emails.\nThreat intelligence\nSign up for threat intelligence services to receive information on the newest phishing attacks and PhaaS techniques.

However, social networks face challenges such as privacy concerns, misinformation distribution and algorithmic biases.\nIt is a known fact that centralized social networks make money by selling their users\u0027 data. On the other hand, the monopolization of the social media space by a few dominant companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube is another hot topic.\nThe good news is that blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can potentially relieve social networks’ pain points. Blockchain’s encryption capabilities can address privacy issues, and AI technologies can tackle the remaining challenges.\nEmbedding AI within smart contracts\nICX, a decentralized social network, aims to facilitate online social interactions and the exchange of information among users via blockchain-based innovations. The platform’s primary goal is to advance communication models featuring enhanced privacy, ownership and community-driven governance.\nAll user data on the network, including posts, images and videos, is stored on-chain. Therefore, users have full ownership and control over their data in accordance with the fundamental principles of privacy and user autonomy.\nICX is being developed on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, a decentralized computing platform that allows software to run without traditional web servers. By leveraging the capabilities of the IC blockchain, ICX is set to embed AI within smart contracts — self-executing agreement codes.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThe Web3 social network is also planning to integrate large language models (LLMs) — AI programs that can recognize and generate humanlike text — to provide users with features like digital clones.\nSophisticated features with democratic governance\nIn addition to AI-driven innovations, ICX wants to differentiate itself from traditional social platforms by giving its community approval power. In the upcoming release, ICX will be governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) — a structure run by member votes without central authority.\nICX developers suggest the DAO model will allow advanced crypto features to be used\nWith the DAO model, any significant updates or changes to ICX\u0027s decentralized application (DApp) will occur following a voting process. Users who want to participate in governance — also called neurons — need to lock their ICX tokens into the network to gain voting rights.\nThe democratic governance framework will also enable sophisticated features such as ragequitting. Ragequitting is a feature that enables DAO members to exit the DAO by burning tokens and withdrawing their share of the treasury.\n“Robots and AI can guide us”\nAs part of the development phases, ICX is preparing to release proof of concept, which is a preliminary demonstration used to confirm that certain theories have the potential to be developed.\nIn the first release, the platform will leverage AI to test new forms of social interaction. ICX\u0027s goal, which will evaluate initial reactions and feedback from users, is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of AI in improving social networking experiences.\nHow integrating AI into social communication works. Source: ICX\nOnce the proof of concept receives positive feedback, the platform will move all its functionality on-chain and become fully decentralized, adhering to the principles of the Internet Computer blockchain protocol.\nAiming to transform the way people interact both online and offline, ICX argues that a better future can be built on the basis of AI-supported social networks. \"We envision a future free from endless social feed scrolling, where humans connect more in the real world,\" ICX founder Marcio says, adding: \"I believe robots and AI can guide us towards this paradise.\"\nAs traditional models come under increasing scrutiny for invading privacy and commoditizing data, the application of decentralized technologies presents a promising alternative. While the digital landscape evolves, the fusion of blockchain and AI may well redefine the foundational structures of social networking, steering it toward a more secure and user-centric future.\nLearn more about ICX\n#Blockchain\n#Smart Contracts\n#Adoption\n#AI\n#Social Media\n#Internet Computer\nDisclaimer.

This technology relies on data transparency and immutability, potentially conflicting with the right to be forgotten or the principle of data minimization.\nWeidener said that these regulations could lead to firms in other countries overtaking German companies, limiting the control and influence of German industry in the global development of these technologies.\nOn the other hand, the GDPR also offers the opportunity to promote the development of blockchain applications that are designed to comply with high standards from the outset.\n“This could make Germany a pioneer in the development of secure, transparent and patient-oriented blockchain solutions in the healthcare sector,” said Weidener.\nAccording to the expert, close cooperation between technology developers, data protection officers and regulatory authorities is required to fully exploit blockchain technology’s benefits and meet the GDPR requirements. “The aim must be to develop innovative solutions that ensure both technical progress and the protection and security of patient data.”\nBlockchain’s bad reputation\nAnother factor in the way of adoption is blockchain technology’s association with cryptocurrencies.\nThe association of blockchain technology with the volatility and security concerns of cryptocurrencies has a negative impact on public perception, said Weidener, adding that the “perceived energy consumption of some blockchain protocols can also lead to concerns about environmental sustainability.”\n“This could lead to reservations among decision-makers and users in the healthcare sector who view the technology with skepticism, especially if sustainability and environmental protection play an important role in their organizations.”\nIn addition to these hurdles, the “strict authorization and certification processes for medical devices mean that any technological innovation must undergo extensive testing and approval procedures, which slows down the innovation cycle.”\nInvestment in research and funding necessary\nAdopting blockchain technology in healthcare also requires significant investment in technology and expertise, which is particularly challenging for smaller clinics and practices. According to Weidener, the need to update or even completely replace existing IT infrastructures and the lack of standardized solutions make implementation even more difficult.\nRecent: Crypto firms brace for intensified SEC, CFTC action after regulator warning\nWeidener emphasized the importance of targeted investment in research and funding, especially for new technologies that comply with data protection regulations. Without this investment, Germany risks falling behind technologically and patients losing access to advanced technologies.\nWeidener said interoperability and integration with existing IT infrastructures, as well as the development of user-centric applications that enable easy interaction with blockchain-based healthcare applications, are also important.\n“This is the only way Germany can play a leading role in the development and implementation of blockchain applications in the healthcare sector.”\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nArm yourself with the latest on crypto laws and guidelines to make smart choices for your crypto ventures.

As Johnson put it, the results were quite positive. “We were astonished by how much less costly it was to run it on blockchain.”\nJohnson added:\n“It’s a very efficient technology, and we think it’s going to open up a lot of new investment opportunities. And, honestly, eventually, I think ETF and mutual funds are all going to be on blockchain.”\nShe attributed this prediction to the “huge costs” associated with verifying data between disparate systems — a problem that blockchain was intentionally designed to solve. Johnson further pointed out that financial institutions and stakeholders still need to verify data between external parties once data is reconciled in-house.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

She cited the use case of pop superstar Rhianna, who released a series of 300 nonfungible tokens that afforded their owners a tiny percentage of royalties for one of the artist’s songs via smart contract.\nThis is a reference Johnson has made in the past. As Cointelegraph reported back in October of 2023, the CEO relayed the Rhianna story during an interview with CNBC’s Delivering Alpha, wherein she discussed tokenization as “securitization done on steroids.”\nSource: Franklin Templeton\nGenerative AI\nThe conversation then shifted to generative artificial intelligence. Johnson acknowledged the usefulness of generative AI systems but also warned that it was “kind of like the kid who gets an ‘A’ in English and an ‘F’ in math.”\nThe CEO noted that Franklin Templeton had recently partnered with Microsoft to build an AI-powered sales assistant, later adding that there were investment opportunities in the space.

Furthermore, application processes require a high level of documentation, especially in international trade.\nYet traditional trade finance remains open to fraud and human error from paper-based workflows. Research shows that the trade finance deficit reached $2.5 trillion in 2022 due in part to inefficiencies and risks arising from outdated practices.\nBlockchain technology can digitize and automate trade processes to enhance transparency, efficiency and security while addressing traditional pain points like fraud and extensive paperwork.\nSupporting SMEs overlooked by big banks\nTradeleaf, an all-in-one blockchain-based trade finance ecosystem, merges traditional and crypto liquidity to facilitate global trade. The platform employs smart contracts — self-executing agreement codes that ensure trust — to create an independent, secure and transparent trade finance network. Tradeleaf uses a digital ecosystem approach to innovate trade finance, making it affordable and interoperable at all stages of the deal and logistics lifecycle.\nFor example, when a T-shirt trade occurs between a supplier and a buyer who does not know each other, an insecure environment occurs. Tradeleaf uses digital assets as collateral to ensure mutual trust and fulfillment of obligations.\nWhile the platform guarantees that the supplier will be paid upon delivery, it also assures the buyer of receiving their goods after payment. The buyer can continue to use his capital until the T-shirts are accepted, and in the meantime, the seller is protected from the risk of non-payment.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

They utilize Tradeleaf’s tools to digitize documents, communicate with counterparties in encrypted settlement rooms, analyze performance and track shipping processes. The platform meets parties whose buying and selling orders are matched, and liquidity providers come in next.\nTradeleaf offers a global network that grants traditional and alternative liquidity providers access to trade finance. While banks and financial institutions represent the conventional side, venture capitalists (VCs) and crypto investors using the decentralized finance (DeFi) model constitute alternative lenders.\nAt the final layer are service partners, software and service providers who provide personal expertise, industry knowledge and innovative tools to customers.\nIntegrating traditional business with crypto\nAiming to transform the trade finance industry, Tradeleaf enables holders of its native token, TLF, to participate in transactions backed by real-world assets (RWAs) — physical assets with intrinsic value. Tradeleaf’s tokenization model supports physical products traded and enables stakeholders to profit from transactions.\nTradeleaf aims to make global trade easier for everyone. Source: Tradeleaf\nThe winner of the best startup at the AIBC/SIGMA Summit 2023, Tradeleaf also announced partnerships with five banks that are committed to providing financing to customers using the native TLF token as collateral. Subsequently, TLF was listed on the MEXC exchange and Coinstore, generating over $1.25 million in revenue in 30 days.\nTradeleaf’s main goal is to close the huge trade finance gap through digital assets. With a network of over 1,000 regulated clients and over 500 brokers in over 100 countries, Tradeleaf works to integrate traditional fiat business methods with crypto efficiency.\nAs blockchain-based platforms broaden their networks and enhance their technological capabilities, the future of trade finance is poised to become more accessible and secure.

We’re just scratching the surface,” he said.\nIn a panel discussion titled “Crypto x AI,” Rhodes’ views were further probed by moderator Alex Lin, co-founder and general partner at Reforge, who asked: Will Microsoft have its own blockchain one day?\n“There’s already a massive amount of interesting stuff going on” in crypto, including in the open source community, responded Rhodes, so “why would we try to recreate something that [already] has so much investment?”\nRather, Microsoft’s focus today is more on optimizing existing technologies, such as layer-2 blockchain rollups. Rhodes added:\n“But would we [Microsoft] ever build an L1 blockchain? I don’t think so.”\nCrypto is “well positioned”\nRhodes and Lin were joined on stage at the April 26 event at Cornell Tech by Neil DeSilva, chief financial officer at PayPal Digital Currencies; Matt Stephenson, head of research at Pantera; and Jasper Zhang, CEO and co-founder at Hyperbolic Labs.\nStephenson opined that “crypto is pretty well positioned to be the ‘picks and shovels’ of a certain type of AI,” particularly transformer and diffusion models. This is especially so given the likelihood of a “decentralized, multiagent” AI future.\nStill, crypto may have to play a secondary role to AI’s lead. Rhodes acknowledged that a “massive trend” like AI tends to “suck a lot of the air out of the room” for other emerging technologies, including crypto/blockchain and Web3.\n“It’s a hot topic — intersection or symbiosis between blockchain networks and AI,” commented Lin. But it’s also susceptible to exaggerated claims, and it can be hard at times to separate what’s hype from what’s real.\nThere’s been a lot of talk about decentralized graphics processing units (GPUs), for instance, continued Lin, “but no one talks about latency,” i.e., the time it takes for data to transfer across a network.\nRecent: Does Trump care about crypto? Bitcoin is latest battleground in US election\nThese days, AI requests or recommendations from a centralized network can be obtained fairly quickly. However, due to “latency,” Lin said, decentralized networks won’t produce those results as quickly.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

That data request “needs to travel from the U.K. across the ocean to Texas and then back again. So that actually has a very huge delay,” said Zhang.\nBy comparison, with a reasonably sized decentralized network, a user could easily find a node in London to process that request locally, which would “actually reduce the communication overhead.”\nIndeed, Hyperbolic Labs recently launched an AI inference interface on the firm’s decentralized network and achieved latency results comparable to those from centralized solutions, Zhang recounted.\nA growing trend: Small language models\nMuch conversation in AI these days focuses on large language models (LLMs) that require massive amounts of computing power. However, according to Rhodes, “a lot is going on in what you could call edge AI — getting smaller language models that actually run efficiently on phones and on laptops.” That is:\n“There is much more compute available at the edge because the models are getting smaller for specific workloads, [and] you can actually take a lot more advantage of that.”\nMicrosoft has been developing small language AI models that require less training data and computational power to develop and run, including its Phi-3 family of open models. Its capabilities “are really starting to approach some of the large language models,” recounted Rhodes.\nRegulators have AI in their sights\nAI is likely to encounter intense scrutiny from regulators around the world in the coming years, much as cryptocurrencies have. What hurdles did panelists anticipate with regard to governmental rules and regulations?\n“I think the United States, in particular, is bad at it [regulation],” said Lin, who referenced the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s heavy-handed approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. “Now, [SEC Chair] Gensler has come out and said we’re going to regulate AI even more aggressively than blockchain’s digital assets.”\nFintech powerhouse PayPal launched its own USD-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD\nPYUSD\n$1.00\n, seven months ago, and so Lin asked DeSilva for his take on U.S. regulation.\n“I don’t think the U.S. is bad at regulation,” said DeSilva. “Look at all the innovation that’s here in the United States.”\nSure, it can be frustrating at times dealing with governmental authorities, but “regulators have a mission,” he explained: “Do no harm to customers.” They’re trying to protect consumers, and there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. Or, as he said from the stage:\n“If you want your technology, your innovation, to be used by millions or billions of customers, you’re going to have to engage with regulators.”\nStill, other jurisdictions, including the European Union, are becoming more welcoming to stablecoin issuers, and the U.S. needs to be mindful of that. “If the U.S. doesn’t move faster, that’s an advantage that will fritter away,” acknowledged DeSilva. “The U.S. has struggled with getting the right urgency level there.”\nFinding just the right amount of regulation could be even more challenging with artificial intelligence. It will be difficult for regulators to manage the potential harm to consumers given AI’s opaque decision-making process — the so-called black box problem — “and I think the regulators will struggle with that,” added DeSilva\nThat opaqueness could actually provide an opportunity for blockchain technology with its transparency, immutability and tracking capabilities. Lin said:\n“You [can] have blockchains coming in as a kind of lord and savior, saying: ‘Regulators, we have this mechanism that can clear up the opacity associated with these black boxes.’”\nWherefore AGI?\nLin concluded the session by asking panelists to share their visions of AI’s future. Will artificial generalized intelligence (AGI) become a reality within the next five to 10 years, for example? And what might one expect in the shorter term?\n“In the near future, AI can be powerful enough that everyone will start using it,” predicted Zhang. “Every company will be an AI company, just like every company is an internet company now.”\n“I think in five to 10 years, AGI will become possible,” continued Zhang. “Look at how fast AI models improve now, and with the help of decentralized infrastructure, we can aggregate the compute,” i.e., boosting the overall volume of available GPUs, which should also enable smaller players to participate.\nElsewhere, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) “will be gone in three years,” predicted Rhodes, superseded by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), a technology that achieves zero trust by “unlocking the value of data on untrusted domains without needing to decrypt it,” according to IBM.\nReader: MakerDAO and Aave’s DeFi conflict reopens over DAI’s perceived risk growth\nFHE will solve a lot of privacy problems, said Rhodes, and could be particularly useful for the healthcare industry, including clinical trials that involve sensitive personal data.\nRhodes, summarizing, recalled the words of the Wharton School’s Ethan Mollick: ”The AI that you’re using today will be the worst version of AI you ever use.” The same could be said with regard to ZK-proofs and fully homomorphic encryption. Overall, computing frameworks that secure privacy are going to get much better, he claimed.\nDeSilva has been working in tech and finance for several decades and has seen many concrete predictions come and go. “But I find that optimism [often] wins the day,” he told the gathering, adding:\n“So my prediction is you [will] get to AGI in time, and that it\u0027s a beneficial thing for people. That will take everybody’s work.”\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

Get insights on prevention and mitigation strategies.","title":"Reentrancy attacks in smart contracts, explained","detailed_content":"Potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts\nDespite being groundbreaking, smart contracts are not impervious to flaws that malevolent parties could exploit. \nInadequate input validation is a prevalent weakness that enables attackers to affect contract execution by providing unexpected inputs. Furthermore, improper application of business logic might result in vulnerabilities by creating unexpected behaviors or logical gaps in the contract. Furthermore, if handled improperly, insecure external calls — such as those involving interfaces with external data sources or other contracts — can pose vulnerabilities.\nReentrancy attacks are weaknesses that occur when a contract calls another contract externally before completing its own state changes. This allows the called contract to reenter the calling contract and maybe carry out some of its operations again. This may result in unanticipated actions and allow attackers to alter the contract’s state, thereby depleting funds or having other negative effects.\nGiven the possibility of such attacks, developers should also exercise caution when working with external contracts or data sources, ensuring that external calls are handled correctly to avoid unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities. They can assist in protecting smart contracts from evolving threats by paying close attention to security procedures like smart contract testing.\nWhat are reentrancy attacks in smart contracts?\nIn smart contracts, reentrancy attacks happen when a contract calls another contract or function externally before finishing its own state changes. \nThis allows the called contract to reenter the calling contract and possibly perform parts of its operations again, which can result in unforeseen and frequently malevolent behaviors. For instance, a situation in which contract A calls contract B to send funds and then modifies its own state. \nContract B’s code may contain a callback function that allows it to reenter contract A and possibly re-execute the transfer function before contract A finishes its state changes. This would enable the attacker to take money from contract A several times before completing the initial transaction.\nThe infamous decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) hack on the Ethereum blockchain in 2016 is another well-known example. An attacker recursively removed funds from the DAO by taking advantage of a reentrancy flaw in the smart contract code, which ultimately resulted in the theft of millions of dollars worth of Ether (ETH).\nMoreover, several decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, including Uniswap, Lendf.Me, BurgerSwap, SURGEBNB, Cream Finance and Siren Protocol suffered significant financial losses due to reentrancy exploits. These breaches resulted in losses ranging from $3.5 million to $25 million, highlighting the persistent threat posed by reentrancy vulnerabilities in the DeFi space.\nHow reentrancy attacks work\nReentrancy attacks use the sequential execution of smart contract functions along with external calls to form a loop in which attackers can execute specific functions multiple times before they finish, which can result in malicious behaviors and unapproved fund withdrawals.\nBefore the victim has completed its state modifications, the attacker’s contract effectively “tricks” the victim’s contract into calling back into the attacker’s contract. Recurring withdrawals or other negligent behaviors may result from this action.\nThe above image demonstrates a reentrancy attack on a smart contract. The attacker’s contract calls the victim’s “withdraw()” function, which sends Ether before updating the balance. The attacker’s fallback function is then triggered, recursively calling withdraw() again to drain funds from the victim contract. This attack exploits the victim’s failure to update the balance before sending funds.\nLet’s break down how reentrancy attacks work using a simplified example:\nSmart contract with a “withdraw” function\nAssume that there is a digital wallet smart contract that permits users to withdraw funds. In addition to keeping track of user balances, this contract has a withdraw function that facilitates funds withdrawal. The withdraw function typically allows users to withdraw their tokens or Ether from the smart contract to their personal wallet.\nUser interaction and function execution\nA user requests a withdrawal from their wallet on their own. They use the withdraw feature to enter the desired withdrawal amount.\nThe withdraw function verifies if the user has enough money to make a withdrawal when it is called. It transfers the required funds to the user’s selected address if the requirements are satisfied. \nExternal call\nThis is where the weakness surfaces. Before the withdrawal is reflected in the user’s balance, the contract makes an external call to another contract or account.\nRecursive call\nIf the code of the external contract includes a function that can call the original contract again (like another withdraw function), then a recursive loop is created. This makes it possible to call the withdraw method again before it finishes.\nReentrancy exploitation\nAn attacker then uses a malicious contract to take advantage of this loop. The attacker’s contract quickly calls the wallet’s withdraw function once more before the balance update during the wallet contract’s invocation of the external contract.\nFallback function\nIn certain situations, a smart contract’s fallback function — a unique feature that kicks in when the contract receives a call without any data or Ether — may be used by the attacker. Reentrancy attacks can be carried out by repeatedly invoking the fallback function while the funds are still being processed.\nState manipulation and repeated withdrawals\nThe attacker’s contract can repeatedly use the withdraw function within the same transaction since the wallet contract delays updating balances until after receiving external calls. As a result, this makes it easier for funds to be taken out without authorization, allowing the attacker to steal more than they are legally entitled to. Subsequently, it inflicts substantial financial losses upon users of the wallet contract.\nRelated: Key Ethereum EIPs to watch in 2024\nConsequences of reentrancy attacks\nReentrancy attacks have serious ramifications for smart contract users, owing to their potential to cause substantial financial losses. \nOne of the most immediate consequences of a reentrancy attack is unauthorized withdrawal or manipulation of cash kept in a susceptible smart contract. Attackers utilize the vulnerability to repeatedly withdraw funds from the contract, depleting its balance and potentially causing significant financial loss to users who have invested or stored assets in the affected contract.\nFurthermore, users’ faith in the security and integrity of smart contracts and blockchain technology in general may be weakened by reentrancy attacks. Reentrancy vulnerabilities can have disastrous effects, as demonstrated by high-profile occurrences like the 2016 DAO hack on the Ethereum blockchain, which caused enormous financial losses and harm to the community’s reputation.\nBeyond the short-term financial consequences, reentrancy attacks may have longer-term effects, such as regulatory and legal attention, diminished investor trust and harm to the standing of blockchain platforms and projects. The perception of vulnerability to attacks may cause users to be cautious when interacting with smart contracts or investing in decentralized applications (DApps), thereby impeding the adoption and expansion of blockchain technology.\nHow to mitigate reentrancy attacks\nImplementing best practices in smart contract creation and auditing is necessary to mitigate reentrancy threats. \nThis includes using well-known code libraries with a track record of security, which is one way to go about it. These libraries have undergone extensive testing and peer review, which lowers the chance of introducing vulnerabilities. \nDevelopers should also use security checks like the “checks-effects-interaction” design, which minimizes the chances of opportunity for reentrancy attacks by ensuring that state modifications happen atomically. An additional line of defense against such vulnerabilities can be added by using reentrancy-safe smart contract development frameworks if they are available. \nDevelopers are less likely to have to manually add security protections because these frameworks frequently include built-in methods and safeguards expressly designed to avoid reentrancy attacks. However, as blockchain security is still developing, developers must continue to be on the lookout for new threats and weaknesses.","tags":[],"author":"by Jagjit Singh","creation_date":"2024-05-16"},{"article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-casinos-can-onboard-millions-of-users-into-web3-myprize-ceo","website_source":"Cointelegraph","article_type":"News Article","summary":"On the latest episode of The Agenda podcast, MyPrize founder Zach Bruch makes the case for crypto casinos and online gambling as a path toward mass adoption.","title":"Crypto casinos can onboard millions of users into Web3 — MyPrize CEO","detailed_content":"Over the long course of human history, one activity that has followed humanity practically everywhere is gambling. The earliest evidence of human gambling dates back to the Paleolithic era, and it has been present in every major civilization and society since then.\nAs technology has evolved, so have the ways people gamble. While major gambling hubs such as Las Vegas and Macau still dominate with brick-and-mortar casinos and entertainment, online casinos have exploded in recent years — and many of these websites use cryptocurrency to power their platforms. The largest, Stake, reportedly generated a whopping $2.6 billion in gross revenue in 2022 alone.\nOn Episode 14 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond spoke with Zach Bruch, founder and CEO of MyPrize — a crypto casino that recently emerged from stealth and is now open for early access — to better understand how crypto casinos work, where they fit into the broader crypto ecosystem, and how they might be silently onboarding millions of people into Web3.\nCrypto and gambling: a match made in heaven?\nBruch argued that the biggest use case for crypto in 2024 is still speculation, and this is playing out via the memecoin craze, which The Agenda recently discussed in depth in Episode 34 with Andreas Brekken of SideShift.ai. According to Bruch, memecoins are so popular “because people love to speculate. People are having fun with their friends. They’re participating as a group. They’re rallying around something, and they’re speculating together.”\n“Gambling has been around since the very first day of human life. People love taking risk. Crypto is the epitome of that.”\nBruch sees crypto casinos as fun places where people can come together as friends to engage in risk-taking and speculative behavior in a fun environment where — at least for MyPrize — the minimum bets can be as low as $0.01.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nBut operating an online crypto casino is not without its challenges. For one, it must comply with the regulatory requirements of each country it operates in, which is why many online casinos — MyPrize included — have separate websites with different functionalities for United States-based customers.\nThe security concerns also differ, as crypto casinos have to make sure their code and smart contracts are bulletproof. In September 2023, Stake was hacked for a reported $41 million. According to Bruch, operating a crypto casino is more akin to operating a crypto exchange: “You’re building user accounts. You’re thinking about AML, KYC, fraud, chargeback risk, asset security, all those different types of things. And all of that comes into play for an online casino as well, right?”\nGambling as a path toward mass adoption\nBruch told The Agenda that online casinos offer significant on-ramps into the crypto ecosystem. “Most people don’t even recognize this, but some of the largest applications for crypto today are on-ramping into the casino space,” he said, offering the opportunity to then funnel these customers into the broader crypto ecosystem. Bruch said that this is made easier because gambling already has a long history of having a great product-market fit.\n“You have all these traditional folks that aren’t actually active members of the crypto ecosystem or the crypto ecosystem that we know it, but are active gamers and gamblers in online casinos, and they are buying crypto to go play in these sites.”\nThis is the long-term vision of MyPrize: Users will on-ramp into crypto through the casino and then remain in Web3. “We’re starting by creating a killer application that will onboard millions of users, and then we’ll funnel those millions of users into a much broader decentralized ecosystem,” Bruch said. \nTo hear more from Bruch’s conversation with The Agenda — including the future of “GambleFi,” whether there will be casinos in the metaverse and more — listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

A project called STYLE Protocol addresses this issue by allowing players to transfer and use digital assets across different games and virtual spaces.","title":"STYLE Protocol maximizes NFT utility with cross-game functionality. Here’s how they do it","detailed_content":"“It makes a lot of sense because there’s a lot of NFTs and valuable assets just sitting around,” said Leo Hilse, founder of STYLE Protocol and guest on Cointelegraph’s recent X Spaces, explaining the essence of his project. “Maybe I don’t need the Bored Ape as a skin, but I can allow others to use it in Roblox. So we’re opening up a protocol that other people can use, where you can get commissions based on the use of that asset that you’ve connected. This is our way of building a long-term sustainable gaming infrastructure.”\nhttps://t.co/N9wZKqjqmC\n— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 1, 2024\nTo achieve transferability, the STYLE Protocol converts NFTs and 2D images into interoperable 3D models that can work in various game engines and environments. In theory, almost any NFT or image can be used as long as it makes logical sense in a 3D setting. “I think there is a huge overlay of possibilities for fashion items, avatars, in-game assets, and anything that can be used in different environments to enhance the player and user experience,” Hilse said.\nHe identified several stages of how the STYLE Protocol works. First, it connects to various virtual environments like Decentraland or Roblox through an API. Then, STYLE Protocol converts 2D assets into 3D models and customizes existing 3D models using AI and a library of base rigs specific to Unreal, Unity, or other virtual environments. The blockchain layer also allows users to connect their existing NFTs within the STYLE Protocol.\nIn estimating the accuracy of the final 3D asset, Hilse noted the multiple parties involved in the process: “I think it’s 70% automated AI plus API. The rest is a manual verification element done by Tailors.” Tailors are a community of 3D designers and engineers within STYLE Protocol. Anyone who can demonstrate their 3D design skills through a test project can join. Tailors will be financially compensated for their work by being compensated in a stablecoin for their participation and rewards in the platform’s native token, $STYLE, for their contributions.\nTailors refer to the AI analysis before starting their work: AI analyzes the initial 2D image to understand its style and color scheme. After Tailors create the 3D overlay, APIs automatically rig the 3D model, adding the skeleton and structure for compatibility with the chosen virtual environment.\nAccording to Hilse, the turnaround time can vary depending on the complexity of the asset. Converting a simple item like a sneaker could take 12 hours, while a high-poly avatar could take up to 48 hours. Fees also vary depending on the rendering requirements and the virtual environment into which the asset is being integrated. “Ultimately, the goal is to minimize fees and make it more applicable to everyday users,” Hilse noted.\nAmong the virtual environments currently supported are Nifty Island, Decentraland, The Sandbox, MONA and Spatial. Off-chain modding for larger Web2 titles such as GTA is also possible but operates outside the blockchain.\nHilse also highlighted an AI 3D creator tool available on the platform: “If you have a lot of crazy ideas for cool models, you can type in a text prompt and it will spit out a 3D design idea that can be turned into a 3D model.”\n$STYLE tokens are required to access the platform’s core functionality. “The barrier to entry is very low,” said Hilse. Currently, users only need about $10 to access basic features. In the future, users will be able to stake $STYLE tokens to unlock advanced features, such as renting out their NFTs as 3D assets in other games.\n“We recently listed $STYLE on the centralized exchanges and also on the DEXs. It’s very important to me that we make decisions based on what’s sustainable. We will only implement additional token utilities and a potential burn mechanism if market conditions support it,\" he added.\nHilse went further: “I think Web3 and various virtual gaming environments as a whole are growing in volume and user base. There’s going to be a market for infrastructure providers of all kinds. And we’re very early with pretty good tech that speaks for itself, a strong team and funding. Our goal is to be the number one accessible infrastructure provider for people to bridge their virtual assets.”\nLearn more about STYLE Protocol\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Games\n#Web3\n#NFT\n#Gaming\nDisclaimer.

With increasing user adoption, transaction fees have skyrocketed, hindering mainstream usage. ZkSync has emerged as a promising solution, aiming to address this issue while preserving Ethereum’s security and decentralization.\nWhat is zkSync?\nZkSync is a zero knowledge (ZK) rollup scaling solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages ZK-proofs, a cryptographic technique, to process transactions off-chain (layer 2 or L2) while inheriting Ethereum’s security features (layer 1 or L1).\nZkSync is the brainchild of Matter Labs, a team of passionate blockchain engineers and entrepreneurs. Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, is a prominent figure in the Ethereum community recognized for his contributions to scaling solutions. The team’s strong technical expertise and dedication to decentralization are critical drivers behind zkSync’s success.\nZkSync’s development is further bolstered by a consortium of renowned investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Balaji Srinivasan. These heavyweight backers provide crucial financial resources and strategic guidance, propelling zkSync’s growth trajectory.\nHere’s how zkSync works:\nzkSync bundles multiple transactions into a single batch, significantly reducing gas fees per transaction.\nTransactions are processed efficiently on the layer 2, alleviating the burden on the main Ethereum network.\nzkSync generates cryptographic proofs (ZK-proofs) proving the validity of the processed transactions without revealing their details. These proofs are then submitted back to the Ethereum mainnet for verification.\nThis approach offers several advantages:\nScalability\nLower fees\nEnhanced privacy\nSecurity.\nZkSync boasts significantly faster transaction processing compared to layer 1s, potentially handling thousands of transactions per second. By batching transactions, zkSync drastically reduces gas fees, making it a cost-effective option for users. ZK-proofs conceal transaction details while verifying their validity, offering a degree of privacy on the public blockchain.\nZkSync inherits Ethereum’s security as the validity proofs rely on the underlying blockchain’s consensus mechanism.\nWhat sets zkSync apart?\nZkSync stands out in the L2 scaling landscape due to its unique features. ZkSync was among the first ZK-rollups to launch a mainnet, giving it a head start in terms of user adoption and development. Unlike some ZK-rollups, zkSync avoids the use of a trusted setup (Application-Specific Trusted Setup or AS-TST), eliminating a potential centralization point.\nAS-TST is a setup process for certain cryptographic systems, often ZK-proofs, where a trusted group generates secret parameters essential to the system’s security, but these parameters cannot be used to break the cryptography itself.\nZkSync also utilizes a novel approach called “Fractal SNARKs” to generate validity proofs, enabling them to scale efficiently with an increasing number of transactions. These innovations have attracted significant interest from the developer community, positioning zkSync as a frontrunner in the race for scalable Ethereum.\nSince its mainnet launch in November 2020, zkSync has witnessed impressive growth. As of May 2024, zkSync has processed millions of transactions, showcasing its real-world utility. The value of crypto assets locked within zkSync has grown steadily to over $150 million across 107 native protocols, indicating user confidence in the platform. A thriving developer ecosystem is emerging around zkSync, with numerous DApps and projects integrating with the platform.\nWhat is the difference between zkSync and Starknet?\nUsing ZK-rollup technology, zkSync prioritizes general-purpose smart contracts and interoperability with existing Ethereum tooling. In contrast, StarkNet is a separate L2 scaling approach using zk-STARK proofs, offering superior scalability but needing Cairo, a particular programming language for smart contracts.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nWhy build on zkSync?\nZkSync unlocks exciting use cases that are challenging or expensive to implement on L1. ZkSync’s low fees and fast transaction processing make it ideal for blockchain-based games requiring frequent microtransactions. Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can leverage zkSync to offer low-cost, high-speed financial services, attracting a broader user base.\nDriven by degens in the crypto community, the nonfungible token (NFT) market thrives on efficient transactions. ZkSync facilitates a cost-effective platform for minting and trading NFTs. These use cases highlight zkSync’s potential to revolutionize various blockchain applications by addressing scalability bottlenecks.\nMoving assets between L1 (Ethereum mainnet) and L2 (zkSync) is a crucial step for users to participate in the zkSync ecosystem. However, bridging introduces an additional layer of complexity and potential risks.\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of the bridging process and the associated considerations:\nHow do cros-schain bridges work? A step-by-step guide\nMost cross-chain bridges use these basic steps to move assets across chains.\nStep 1: The user selects the asset and amount they wish to transfer from Ethereum to zkSync.\nStep 2: The bridge locks the user’s chosen tokens in a smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet.\nStep 3: An equivalent amount of tokens is minted on zkSync, representing the locked assets on L1.\nStep 4: The user receives the newly minted tokens on zkSync, which they can then use within the zkSync ecosystem.\nThe reverse process (transferring assets from zkSync back to Ethereum) follows a similar principle, with the bridge burning the zkSync tokens and unlocking the corresponding assets on the Ethereum mainnet.\nBridging options for zkSync\nSeveral bridge solutions facilitate asset movement between Ethereum and zkSync.\nMatterport: Developed by Matter Labs, the team behind zkSync, Matterport is a secure bridge designed specifically for zkSync. It leverages a network of validators to ensure the safe transfer of assets and offers a user-friendly interface.\nGeneric bridges: Bridges like Synapse can also be used to transfer assets between Ethereum and zkSync. These bridges often support a wider range of tokens but might involve additional fees and potential security risks due to their generic nature.\nThe image below from DefiLlama shows how much money has been bridged to and from zkSync.\nAn exhaustive list of bridges for zkSync can be found on DefiLlama.\nWhile many of these are options to bridge into zkSync, users must do their due diligence before using them. There are several risks to using bridges, which are highlighted later in the article.\nHow to bridge to zkSync using Matterport (zkSync’s official bridge)\nTo bridge to zkSync using Matterport, follow these steps:\nVisit the bridge interface: Access Matterport’s bridge interface via https://portal.zksync.io/.\nConnect your wallet: Connect a supported Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet.\nSelect assets and amounts: Choose the token you wish to bridge from Ethereum to zkSync and input the desired amount.\nApprove the transaction: In your wallet, approve the transaction, which generally includes paying an Ethereum gas fee.\nWait for confirmation: Depending on network congestion, the bridging process may take some time. Once confirmed, your assets should appear in your zkSync wallet.\nHow to bridge to zkSync using generic bridges\nTo bridge to zkSync using generic bridges, follow these steps:\nVisit the bridge website: Go to the website of your chosen bridge — e.g., Synapse.\nConnect wallets: Connect your Ethereum wallet and create or connect your zkSync wallet if needed.\nSelect networks and token: Choose “Ethereum” as the source chain, “zkSync” as the destination, and the token you want to transfer.\nInput amount and approve: Enter the desired amount and approve the transaction in your Ethereum wallet (paying gas fees).\nCross-chain transfer: The bridge will handle the transfer to your zkSync wallet. This may involve multiple steps and fees.\nWhat wallet supports zkSync?\nSeveral wallet options are available to hold funds and interact with applications on the zkSync network. Popular choices include:\nMetaMask (a widely used Ethereum wallet that also supports zkSync)\nArgent (a mobile-first wallet focusing on security and user experience).\nThe official zkSync portal also offers a built-in wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger provide enhanced security for significant holdings. When choosing a zkSync wallet, consider factors like ease of use, security features, support for specific DApps within the zkSync ecosystem and whether you prefer a mobile or browser-based experience.\nDoes Coinbase Wallet support zkSync?\nAs of May 2024, zkSync is not supported natively by Coinbase Wallet. This implies that you are unable to use your Coinbase Wallet to directly deposit or withdraw money from the zkSync network. To move funds from Ethereum — which Coinbase Wallet supports — to your zkSync wallet, you will need to use a bridge.\nDoes Trust Wallet support zkSync?\nUnfortunately, Trust Wallet does not directly support zkSync. However, using Trust Wallet, you could utilize a bridge to interact with DApps or transfer assets from a supported network (like Ethereum) to the zkSync network.\nRisks associated with blockchain bridges\nWhile bridging offers a convenient way to move assets, it also introduces certain risks to consider. Bridges rely on smart contracts, which can be susceptible to hacks or exploits if not properly secured. It’s crucial to choose bridges with a proven track record that undergo rigorous security audits.\nSome bridges employ centralized custodians to hold the locked assets during the transfer process. This introduces a single point of failure and potential censorship risks. Opting for decentralized bridges with distributed validator networks mitigates this risk.\nWhen using liquidity pools within bridges, users might experience impermanent loss if the price of the bridged asset fluctuates significantly between the locking and unlocking stages. Understanding the risks involved in liquidity pools is essential.\nBridges have notoriously been crypto’s Achilles’ heel and have been exploited by hackers. The Ronin Bridge hack and the Wormhole bridge hack in the past few years resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto assets.\nMitigating risks associated with blockchain bridges\nHere are some tips to minimize the risks associated with bridging assets:\nUsers should try to choose established bridges with a strong security record and undergo regular audits by reputable security firms.\nIt is critical to familiarize oneself with the specific functionalities of the chosen bridge, including fees, supported assets and potential centralization risks.\nIf using liquidity pools within a bridge, users must be aware of impermanent loss risks and monitor asset prices to minimize potential losses.\nUsers must avoid transferring more assets than they plan to use immediately on any new protocols to minimize exposure to bridge risks.\nBy following these practices, users can make informed decisions when bridging assets and participate in the zkSync ecosystem with greater confidence.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

[…] We will not have equality in any form until we have economic parity. We’re not going to have economic parity until we teach people to be, instead of unsophisticated at anything, sophisticated, and that comes through education.”\nThe senior adviser’s comments come a week after FTX’s new amended proposal was released on May 7. The proposal promises “billions in compensation” for the users and creditors of the bankrupt exchange who have been unable to access their funds since November 2022.\nThe meltdown of FTX and its over 130 subsidiaries forced regulators to take action and develop investor-safety-oriented regulations, while the United States Securities and Exchange Commission started a crackdown on crypto exchanges to avoid another FTX-like meltdown.\nHowever, instead of regulatory efforts that may stifle digital asset innovation, the industry would benefit more from educating unsophisticated investors, argued Vela:\n“To my fellow Democrats a bit to my left who are a little overzealous on regulation: Stop it. You’re not doing anybody any favors. It might make you feel good because you think you’re protecting the unsophisticated investor, but rather than then having to overregulate to protect the unsophisticated investor, why don’t we make the investors sophisticated?”\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

Because this industry is here to stay. It is an integral part of our global future. […] So, let’s foster smart growth and safe growth.”\nFollowing the collapse of FTX, crypto exchanges worldwide have been striving for more transparent operations, spearheaded by Binance, the world’s largest exchange, which could not escape the SEC’s hawkish stance.\nIn June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase and Binance for alleged securities violations. In the lawsuit against Binance, the SEC alleged that the company and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, had misappropriated billions of dollars of user funds.\nBinance was charged with violating Anti-Money Laundering laws and settled to pay $4.3 billion, one of the largest criminal fines in history.\nThis type of regulatory enforcement is in contrast with the innovation-friendly approach advocated by Vela, who said:\n“What I preach for is regulation that protects and prevents but does not cripple and destroy [innovation].”\nRelated: GameStop tops Bitcoin\u0027s yearly gains in one day — Will GME spark an altcoin rally?\nExchange or buy FTT\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

As part of its vision to bridge the Web2 experience with Web3 capabilities, VisitorApp is working on integrating crypto payments. Any purchased experience is presented with a nonfungible token (NFT) ticket — a digital collectible — through Camino Network. A relic of blockchain technology, these NFTs provide transparent and verifiable proof of purchase.\nDuring the Decode Travel hackathon in April 2024, VisitorApp’s application was used in practice. Event participants were able to mint their event tickets on Camino Network via VisitorApp, showcasing an active use case for travel tech developers.\nWhat is regional becomes global\nCamino Network is easily accessible by travel industry stakeholders, allowing any regional vendor to connect to a global hub. As users face a simplistic design on the front end with the application, blockchain technology enables seamless, secure, global communication in the background.\nVisitorApp is working on the integration with Camino Messenger, which will provide regional offers with direct access to the worldwide Camino Network, making regional attractions visible to a broader audience. The integration will be vital in connecting regional activities directly to the global travel market.\nCustomers can simultaneously purchase various offers from different vendors across different regions and store them in their mobile VisitorApp Wallet in their travel folder. The platform also supports white labeling, allowing destinations and regions to create their own ecosystem tailored to their specific needs.\nFostering trust through transparency and traceability\nCamino Network provides an efficient and community-driven environment that lowers costs, increases speed and ensures data transparency. As a result, every transaction on VisitorApp, whether it is a ticket purchase, tour booking or activity reservation, is authenticated and traceable. This transparency fosters a new level of trust between service providers and travelers.\nHighlighting the lack of improvements in the tourism market for tickets, tours and activities, especially in smaller and less professionally marketed destinations, Stefan Follmer, chief operating officer of VisitorApp, said:\n“With VisitorApp platform solutions, local offers can finally be made bookable in a simple, trustworthy and affordable way and presented to a global group of buyers via Camino Network.”\nVisitorApp scratches the surface of what can be achieved in the travel industry with a blockchain specifically designed to address the needs of travel businesses like regional tourism boards.

From visiting a historical ruin for the first time to randomly attending a local musician’s performance, the satisfying feeling of embracing the entire essence of what a touristic visit can offer keeps most of the travel industry operational and thriving.\nHowever, as the idea of a regional visit slowly turns into a plan and then into a calendar-filling endeavor, travelers soon realize that it’s way easier to dream about going to Nordic fjords than actually realizing the whole trip through scheduling, booking and transactions.\nDespite the decade-long digitization of the industry, travel systems are still operating at a surprisingly regional scale. Along with travel agencies, regional attractions and vendors like museums or event venues face limited market reach, often hindering them from marketing and selling their offerings to a global audience. Even when they score by selling tickets to a global customer group for a period of time, the lack of better customer insights makes it hard to reproduce the success.\nFor travelers, that translates to unnecessarily complicated booking processes that require ticketing from multiple apps and services. Furthermore, the potential risks associated with first-time visits beg for full traceability and transparency across the travel experience.\nNFT ticketing for the masses\nThe traditional “Web2” travel industry lacks a reliable solution to seamlessly integrate local offerings with global platforms, and blockchain is here to change that. VisitorApp, a blockchain-powered ticketing solution, showcases how Web3 can simplify regional travel for both travelers and industry participants.\nUsing Camino Network, the first blockchain designed for the needs of the travel industry, VisitorApp offers users a one-stop shop for discovering and purchasing local offerings directly from regional vendors. The VisitorApp team has spent four years to forge regional platforms and mobile apps for cities, regions and event organizers.\n  Read more\nThe bear market from 2022 to 2023 intensified scrutiny, with many questioning President Nayib Bukele’s actions. However, Bukele doubled down on his Bitcoin bet by announcing that the country would buy one BTC every day.\nBukele handily won the 2024 El Salvador presidential election with widespread support nationwide.\nRelated: El Salvador’s Bitcoin wallet gets sats, cats and a cypherpunk manifesto\nBitcoin mining and its use of fossil fuels have long been controversial topics in the crypto industry.\nThe Ripple-backed Greenpeace, among others, has advocated for transitioning Bitcoin from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed a proof-of-work mining moratorium into law on Nov. 22, 2023, making it the first state in America to ban any PoW crypto mining activity for two years.\nAfter purchasing $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pledged to incorporate it as a payment method for Tesla cars. However, he reversed his decision soon after, citing the negative environmental impact of mining. Musk said he would reconsider this move only when over 50% of Bitcoin mining operates on renewable energy sources.\nSince Musk made his promise, numerous reports have suggested that over 60% of BTC mining relies on renewable energy sources.\nMusk has yet to acknowledge these reports or implement a BTC payment option. Tesla currently faces a lawsuit for repeatedly violating the Clean Air Act by releasing harmful pollutants from its Fremont factory into nearby neighborhoods.\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

According to its official website, it provides decentralized finance applications on Bitcoin. Its bridges are used to transfer assets from other networks, such as BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum, to its own network.\nBlockchain data confirms that the Alex deployer account performed five identical upgrades to the “Bridge Endpoint” contract on BNB Smart Chain beginning at 3:56 pm UTC. Approximately $4.3 million worth of Binance-Pegged Bitcoin (BTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Sugar Kingdom Odyssey (SKO) were subsequently removed from the BNB Smart Chain side of the bridge.\nBecause the upgrade was performed by the protocol’s deployer account, CertiK labeled the event “a possible private key compromise.” \nSource: CertiK\nThe upgrade transaction changed the implementation address to one ending in 7058.

Source: Cointelegraph\nRegulatory compliance became even more critical for privacy-focused protocols on May 14 after Dutch authorities sentenced Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev to five years and four months in prison for allegedly laundering $1.2 billion worth of illicit digital assets on the platform.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMAY 15, 2024\nWeb3 travel app turns regional experiences into mintable NFTs\nTravelers around the world are ready to discover new destinations, and blockchain is here to help connect local attractions to global experiences.\nTraveling to a new region always conjures up delightful experiences and vivid memories. From visiting a historical ruin for the first time to randomly attending a local musician’s performance, the satisfying feeling of embracing the entire essence of what a touristic visit can offer keeps most of the travel industry operational and thriving.\nHowever, as the idea of a regional visit slowly turns into a plan and then into a calendar-filling endeavor, travelers soon realize that it’s way easier to dream about going to Nordic fjords than actually realizing the whole trip through scheduling, booking and transactions.\nDespite the decade-long digitization of the industry, travel systems are still operating at a surprisingly regional scale. Along with travel agencies, regional attractions and vendors like museums or event venues face limited market reach, often hindering them from marketing and selling their offerings to a global audience. Even when they score by selling tickets to a global customer group for a period of time, the lack of better customer insights makes it hard to reproduce the success.\nFor travelers, that translates to unnecessarily complicated booking processes that require ticketing from multiple apps and services. Furthermore, the potential risks associated with first-time visits beg for full traceability and transparency across the travel experience.\nNFT ticketing for the masses\nThe traditional “Web2” travel industry lacks a reliable solution to seamlessly integrate local offerings with global platforms, and blockchain is here to change that. VisitorApp, a blockchain-powered ticketing solution, showcases how Web3 can simplify regional travel for both travelers and industry participants.\nUsing Camino Network, the first blockchain designed for the needs of the travel industry, VisitorApp offers users a one-stop shop for discovering and purchasing local offerings directly from regional vendors. The VisitorApp team has spent four years to forge regional platforms and mobile apps for cities, regions and event organizers.\n  Read more\nThe sentencing was handed down despite Tornado Cash being a noncustodial crypto mixing protocol — meaning that the funds that go through the protocol are never held or controlled by it.\nIn a promising development for open-source code developers, ZK-proofs could be used to guarantee that none of the cryptocurrencies on a set platform were previously related to any illicit activities, according to Niemerg:\n“From the time of the last 20 transactions or from block XYZ, [ZK-proofs] can create various types of proofs guaranteeing that these funds never touched anybody associated with the sanctions list.”\nWith a decentralized Web3 identity for each user, ZK-proofs could be used to verify that funds and wallets are unrelated to criminal activity while maintaining the user’s anonymity.\nHowever, Niemerg noted that both ZK-proofs and decentralized identity systems need more development before facilitating such complex functions.\nRelated: Coinbase recovers after system-wide outage, but user withdrawals remain offline\nFinancial privacy is not a crime\nFor AlephZero, helping developers build compliant privacy tools is a priority, according to Niemerg:\n“There’s plenty of actual real-world use cases whenever it comes to private transactions… Just because you want privacy, that doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong.”\nFinancial privacy has been a growing concern since 2022 when the United States government blacklisted Tornado Cash for alleged money laundering.\nThe concerns intensified on April 24 after the arrest of the Samourai Wallet founders. The cryptocurrency wallet’s CEO, Keonne Rodriguez, and chief technology officer William Hill will each face one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.\nThe arrest was classified as an attack on crypto privacy pioneers, according to Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant:\n“Privacy stands as a core value of Bitcoin. Mixing itself is not a crime. Even crypto exchanges use mixing to safeguard user privacy. It’s like punishing the inventor of the knife instead of the one who uses it.”\nRelated: Pre-launch token trading 20 times more volatile than post-launch trading — Keyrock\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nArm yourself with the latest on crypto laws and guidelines to make smart choices for your crypto ventures.

Satoshi Nakamoto launched…","title":"In Search of Lost Keys","detailed_content":"This is a “blast from the past” article, which I think is appropriate, given that the New Year is nearly upon us. Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, the first ever blockchain, on January 3rd, 2009. And so we are almost upon the 15th anniversary of the occasion.Blockchains use wallets as their main user interface, and over the last decade and a half, wallets and the management of private keys have developed significantly. For this article, written with the help of the engineers over at Resonance Security, I go through some of the problems experienced in the past by developers and users of blockchain wallets.This should give you a clearer understanding as to why wallets are so important, and why they are such a difficult technology to provide securely and reliably.Satoshi’s first release included both the software for running a blockchain node and a blockchain wallet. Wallet software manages the private keys that are used by those owning assets on a blockchain to authorize transactions. These private keys derive the public blockchain addresses that hold the digital assets and are used to digitally sign the approvals for the transactions involving those assets.Blockchains use asymmetric key cryptography; typically ECDSA, and that means that to generate a private key you need to select a random 256-bit number (a number between 1 and about 1.157 * 10⁷⁷, which is approximately 1 followed by seventy-seven zeroes, or a hundred quattuorvigintillion).It turns out that a) selecting a truly random un-guessable 256-bit number is rather hard, and b) looking after that number without losing it or allowing someone else to access and steal it is even harder.The first blockchain wallet mentioned above is sometimes referred to as the Satoshi client. In the early days, the Satoshi client generated private keys randomly using a C++ random number generator and stored them in a file called wallet.dat.Initially, the file was unencrypted, which meant that once bitcoin began to have a dollar value, hackers started trying to hack into networked computers running the client to steal a copy of the wallet.dat file and hence the crypto stored in the derived bitcoin addresses.Laterwallet.dat was encrypted with a random master key, which was itself encrypted with a password called a wallet passphrase. Sometimes users selected wallet passphrases that were too simple and could be guessed by trial and error over time.People still occasionally find old installations of the early Bitcoin software on their decommissioned computers and hard drives, with wallet.dat files storing keys providing access to old stashes of bitcoin. If the files are early enough to be unencrypted, or the original owner can remember the passphrase, this can lead to an unexpected crypto-windfall.Around 2013 or so, some people came up with an idea that initially seemed brilliant — create a password or a passphrase, and hash it with the SHA256 cryptographic hash function to obtain a 256-bit number that could be used as a private key. That way, you can carry your bitcoin around in your head!There are two problems with this approach. The first is that people are not good at remembering things over long periods of time. A passphrase may seem memorable today, but a year or a decade from now … not so much.The second is that humans are not good at coming up with truly random passwords, and so many brainwallets turned out to be guessable. For example, someone thought that a line from the Simpsons season 5, episode 7 would make a good passphrase: “You don’t win friends with salad!”, using it to generate the public address 15gCfQVJ68vyUVdb6e3VDU4iTkTC3HtLQ2This was guessed by someone, who drained the three bitcoin it was holding at the time. Fortunately, these were subsequently returned, and the original owner learned a lesson that could have cost them tens or hundreds of bitcoins.It does not matter how careful you are with your wallet, keeping it offline and storing your seed phrase in a safe in the back of a bank vault, if the method used to generate the private keys was not truly random in the first place.This is a recurring problem in computer programming. Computers do not do random very well — they are deterministic machines. In most cases, for example, if you are writing a game with enemies spawning randomly, using a fast pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is good enough.But PRNGs generate the same sequence of “random” numbers on any computer, provided you kick off the process with the same seed value, and developers often use the current time as the PRNG seed value.No one is going to put time and effort into determining exactly where a bunch of goblins or zombies are going to appear in a computer game, but if the random numbers are used to generate blockchain addresses, and those blockchain addresses are holding cryptocurrency, then it makes sense to try a bunch of seed inputs to see if they generate value-holding addresses.It turned out that a wallet provider called Cakewallet made exactly this mistake in their code. Given that the first Cakewallet release was in 2018, and the flaw wasn’t discovered until 2021, that left a three-year window of vulnerable wallet addresses.And three years is only 95 million seconds. All those wallet addresses could therefore be brute forced with less than 100 million tries, which is not an especially large number if you’re running your cracking software offline and have a decent computer and a few months.When given too much responsibility, the instinctive approach taken by many is to find someone to act as a parent and take on the duties and liabilities. Hence custodial wallets. Transfer your assets to a company or a person, and have them handle the headache of securing the wallets, remembering the passwords, and preventing hackers.The theory is that an organization dedicated to safeguarding bitcoin and other digital assets has efficiencies of scale, and can hire a gamut of security consultants, cryptography software developers, and experienced network engineers to make sure everything runs smoothly.In practice, there are plenty of examples of custodial wallets failing, large and small. Two of the most famous are:The problem with custodianship is that there is no guarantee the custodian is any more competent than you are and may be a criminal to boot. Furthermore, cryptocurrency has no Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guaranteeing your assets against theft or loss. What’s more, a centralized custodian makes a rich single target for hacker groups.How about cutting out custodians, or holding on to your own assets, and using a smart contract? That’s exactly what the Parity wallet smart contract library on Ethereum was designed for. The assets are transferred to the wallet smart contract using the library, and multiple authorization signatures are required to move the assets back out of the wallet later on.This multisig approach seemed like a good one (and indeed it is): require several people to sign off, for example, three out of six board members. Then if one or two of them lose their passphrase due to phishing or oversight, or are corrupt embezzlers, the assets are still safe.Unfortunately, the Parity wallet library contained a bug. When it was deployed (or rather, re-deployed to fix another bug), back in 2017, the wallet library wasn’t initialized to have an owner. A “kill” function was included in the code, which could be called by the owner of the contract. Someone going by the handle of devops199 first called the initialization function to take ownership of the library and then called the kill function, freezing all the funds being held by multiple multisig wallets using the Parity wallet library.The total lost? 513,743 ETH, or about 1.2 billion US dollars in today’s prices.Looking after your crypto-assets seems like a game of “head you lose, tails the hackers win.” It’s hard to look after them yourself and even harder to let someone else do it for you.The fact remains that crypto is still in the wilderness. You have to decide — do I go with a tour guide (and how can I assess how competent they are), or do I learn survival skills and rely on myself. Until the blockchain space becomes a park, that is the way it will be.Till then, protecting yourself and your assets involves work:And now all that remains is for me and Resonance Security to wish you a prosperous, but above all, a safe New Year.","tags":[],"author":"Keir Finlow-Bates","creation_date":"2023-12-29"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/babylonchain-io/babylon-testnet-bbn-test-3-sunset-announcement-8a45e0017d1f","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The Babylon team will sunset the current Bitcoin staking testnet at 12pm UTC, 16/05/2024 to clear the ground for the next testnet.

Within 48 hours of launching, it attracted over 100K pioneer stakers. During its operation, the team has collected a lot of constructive feedback and suggestions from the community. The team has also identified several areas for improvements. All of them are invaluable to the development of the next testnet. We highly appreciate the participation and contributions from the community.Since this testnet has fulfilled its purpose, to clear the ground for the next one, we have decided to sunset it in two weeks. All operations will be fully functional until then, including staking, unbonding, and withdrawal of the Signet BTC.The next testnet will still use Bitcoin Signet, the most reliable Bitcoin test network. So, if you are interested in trying out the next testnet, you could consider unbonding and withdrawing your Signet BTC from the current testnet (Babylon — Staking Dashboard). We will also host a BTC Signet faucet on Discord. More details about the next testnet will be released later.Finally, we would like to emphasize that Signet BTC is only a simulated BTC for testing that can be used only for the Bitcoin Signet test network.

We’re still doing some last minute optimisations and tweaks, but everything is ready.Pretty much everything that has been previously outlined for Phase 1:2. Anonymity — no mandatory email address or names for end-users during registration. No logging — unless explicitly enabled by you, the user, for purposes of, for example, resolving issues and debugging. Logs are transitory and wiped when logging is disabled and no longer required.3. Crypto payments with special offers and bonuses for FUND paymentsPerfection. Whilst we have endeavoured to find/fix bugs and optimise the platform, it’s still a beta, so there will be issues that were not picked up during our smaller scale alpha testing. Bugs are an inevitability with software, and the wider scale public beta will help us catch and kill anything we missed, overlooked or were not even aware of during alpha testing. This is, of course, all a part of a large scale changes required as we move into Phase 2.Since this is a beta, we will be offering bug bounties. Details to follow.In parallel with bug fixing and optimising Phase 1 during the public beta, we will soon be starting planning and development for UNoDE Phase 2 — beginning the SaaS chapter of UNoDE.With Phase 2, we aim to develop tools to allow potential operators to spin up their own RPC infrastructure and join the UNoDE family. Along with revenue sharing, this will help propel UNoDE into becoming a truly decentralised NaaS platform unlike any existing options today.Phase 2 of the UNoDE project aims to focus on implementing the SaaS (software as a service) aspect, in order to provide a decentralised network of NaaS RPC nodes.UNoDE aims to offer a suite of scripts and tools allowing potential third party UNoDE Operators to deploy their own RPC nodes and connect them to the UNoDE API.The UNoDE backend will maintain a list of “healthy” third party nodes, allowing the end-user API to route requests to these nodes. We aim to have these requests be load balanced, and also routed based on IP geo-location to reduce potential network latency incurred by third party nodes being situated in a different physical location.The UNoDE backend also aims to maintain a history of the number of requests successfully routed to and served by third party nodes, so that some of the revenue earned from UNoDE subscriptions can be shared with third party UNoDE Operators.What does all this mean? For the vast majority of end-users (developers, traders etc.), this should be a seamless implementation, and no changes should be required on their part. Existing API keys will remain the same, so the transition should be smooth.For potential Node Operators, there will be some new sections in the UNoDE UI, allowing the generation of a new API key which is used specifically for registering their RPC nodes to the UNoDE network. Additionally, Node Operators should have access to a new area of the UI giving an overview of their nodes and data such as health status, number of requests served, and their current share of revenue, history etc.We will be reaching out to our existing alpha testers during Phase 2 development, and will also eventually open up registration for new alpha testers.True network decentralisation — including revenue sharing, and sustained growth together — has been the bastion pillar of Unification and will continue to a much deeper chapter as we expand our development into the next phase of UNoDE. We look forward to having you join us as users, supporters, developers \u0026 operators into the next chapter.GitHub: https://github.com/unification-comTelegram: https://t.me/unificationfoundationDiscord: https://discord.com/channels/725618617525207042Website: https://www.unification.com","tags":["Unode","Unification","Fund","Blockchain","Privacy"],"author":"Codegnosis"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/quantum-economics/10-highlights-from-messaris-epic-crypto-theses-2024-part-1-1998ca5f915c","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Published December 19, and clocking in at 193 pages (a 23% increase from 2023’s Theses), Messari’s “Crypto Theses 2024” is (IMHO) the…","title":"10 Highlights From Messari’s Epic ‘Crypto Theses 2024\" — Part 1","detailed_content":"Published December 19, and clocking in at 193 pages (a 23% increase from 2023’s Theses), Messari’s “Crypto Theses 2024” is (IMHO) the industry’s most insightful overview of the crypto ecosystem, and a must-read for every crypto enthusiast. TL;DR “Crypto remains inevitable”.The report is authored by Ryan Selkis, Co-Founder and CEO of web3 data provider and research powerhouse Messari, While Ryan was supported by the accomplished Messari research team, the report is written in the first person by Selkis. I’ve been a Selkis fanboy since Jan. 2020 when he spoke at CryptoMondays NYC and mesmerized us with his discussion of his Crypto Theses 2020 and tales of breaking the Mt. Gox hack in 2014. I also believe that Messari Pro, a “one-stop shop for all your crypto data and research needs”, is an essential tool for any serious crypto investor.The report provides a comprehensive state-of-the-state of crypto coupled with thought provoking predictions about 2024 and beyond. Each chapter is overflowing with insight:Given the length, I broke this post in to two pieces, each covering five chapters. I write this every year to force myself to read the entire Theses, go down rabbit holes, and LEARN. But, as educational as the report is, few will read it’s entirety. So below are my most intriguing highlights in each of the first five entertaining and sagacious chapters of this prodigious report.In the same way that crypto is inevitable, so is AI. And the two, in combination, will prove world changing, providing solutions problems vexxing humanity.In an age of infinite deep fakes, crypto tech will provide “mathematically guaranteed provenance” via “timestamping and verifying devices and data”. Generative DDOS attacks can be muted via “.. ”the fees required by public blockchains”. Crypto tech is the solution for a world where AI is generating trillions (?) of micro-payments a day.Video of a CryptoMondays Palo Alto I hosted in October on the intersection of AI \u0026 Web3 is a great primer on te topic:Also, shoutout to Messari for popularizing DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) as a moniker last year. Nomenclature is important!Cathie Wood is the epic Founder, in 2014, of ARK Invest ($20B+ AUM), the first institutional fund to invest in Bitcoin (via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust). While Ark invests in a broad range of innovation sectors, Cathie’s thought leadership and bullish stance on crypto has been unwavering for years. Shortly after I saw the crypto light on 6/29/17, I sought out Cathie as she was the smartest institutional investor on bitcoin, and I wanted to learn. Cathie couldn’t have been nicer and more giving of her time.Now, ARK is poised to be the first Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC given the January 10 deadline by which “… regulators must either reject or approve her company’s ETF.”Amazingly, ARK open sources their research, which includes an incredible YouTube channel (544,000 subscribers):Cathie also hosts legendary Twitter Spaces:I’m a fan boy, and honored to be one of just 389 people Cathie follows on X.This is a NEW section to enable Ryan “… to share the killer product experiences that I had this year”. I learned a lot in this section. I had never even heard of “Project Guardian”, the tokenization joint venture between JP Morgan and Apollo, among others.I think of the products Ryan highlighted, the most impactful one, to date, is “USDT (Tether) on Tron”, because, as Ryan put it, USDT on Tron is “…. crypto’s first truly globally important app”.Tether has long been the main settlement currency for crypto exchanges outside the U.S.. But today, per Tether CEO, Paolo Ardoino, “… 40% of USDT demand was now coming from store of value and payment use cases, particularly in developing countries”. As the use cases expanded, so has Tether’s dominance of the stablecoin market, which now stands at 70%:I think of Tron as the AOL of crypto in Asia. Just like AOL wasn’t the internet, but it made accessing the internet easier. And while Ethereum is the leading blockchain in terms of total stablecoin marketcap on chain, it’s not surprising that Tron is a dominant second:In fact, Tron has 26X more stablecoin assets onchain than Solana.Tron transactions are largely in Asia for gaming and gambling apps. Asians users prefer Tron over Ethereum because it’s cheaper, faster, and better optimized for use in Asia. That’s why Tron processes more transactions at a fraction of the fees:This was another super dense chapter. I would have chosen USDT if I hadn’t already gone in depth on USDT in #3. I’m a huge fan of FRAX, the algorithmic stablecoin. And like many, privacy is a focus, and I’ve been intirgued with Privacy Pools, an innovative, regualtory compliant, Tornado-like, privacy solution proposed by Ameen Solemani and Vitalik:But I chose CBDCs because, as opposed to Ryan, I think they’re going to be a big thing, sooner rather than later. I’m less concerned than Ryan about the dystopian possibilities of CBDCs because we already have dystopian financial surveillance. It could get worse, but the upside if CBDCs onboard billions of people to digital currencies, outweighs the downside risk.As Ryan an highlights, most CBDC pilots have been “wholesale” CBDCs, involving transactions between financial institutions. Ryan doesn’t think retail CBDC will be relevant “… anywhere before 2030”, even though he highlights numerous CBDC trials underway. Even Ryan thinks China’s e-CNY is one to watch given it’s scale, having processed over $250B of transactions across 120 million wallets created since 2020. CBDC pilots Ryan highlighted coming 2024 CBDC pilots from the Bank for International Settlements, the Bank of Korea and Russia. But the CBDC tracker below, via the Atlantic Council, reveals that CBDCs have been launched in 11 countries with another 21 either running pilots or planning one in 2024. In total, 90% of countries are exploring, developing or implementing CBDCs:Even Ripple got into CBDCs in May via the launch of a CBDC platform by forking it’s XRP Ledger. The Ripple CBDC Platform “offers a comprehensive platform for minting, managing, transacting, and destroying CBDCs and stablecoins”.I’m in crypto because I think our fiscal systems are broken, beyond repair. I’m here because we finally have decentralized financial tools that enable us to “exit the system” if we choose.I joke that I want to think about the regulators as much as the regulators think about me. Now, that said, I appreciate that the more favorable the regulations are, the better. I applaud and support the Herculean efforts made by CoinCenter and other industry lobby groups in D.C.. But Google and Facebook aren’t allowed in China, and they’re still doing great. As Ryan says, crypto is inevitable. And I think the best way to get favorable U.S. crypto regulations is to build great products that people want because it makes their life better. The more successful we are, the more jobs we have the potential to create, the more D.C. will embrace us. I believe time spent building has a far higher ROI for the industry than time spent lobbying.While much of this section is a lesson in civics, I appreciate Ryans wit:As Ryan highlights, the government lied about the failures of SVB and Signature Bank earlier this year. It’s now been well documented the 2023 bank insolvencies were greatly exacerbated by the regulators’ implementation of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. We now know there was a “… multi-step, multi-month, multi-agency effort to de-bank major crypto platforms from Silvergate, SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank”.Following the collapse of SVB I wrote a post “The One Great Thing To Come Out Of The Tragic Collapse of SVB” where I posited that many wealthy people in Silicon Valley just learned :It makes so much sense. But like most things in life, most humans have to learn things the hard way.It’s not a coincidence that Bitcoin was up 50% the month following the collapse of SVB!Ryan highlighted an insightful talk I saw this year on The Swamp in D.C., Bill Gurley’s epic take on regulatory capture at “The All In Summit”:While Ryan believes “We can’t walk away from all “engagement” in DC when many leaders are ready to legislate punitively on our industry”, I believe “The Way To Get Better U.S. Crypto Regs Is To Leave The U.S.”.— — —Stay tuned for Part 2 to be published imminently.Here are five other insightful outlooks for crypto 2024:4. 2024 Blockchain Predictions — From crypto fund-of-fund Blockchain Coinvestors (where I’m a Partner)5. 10 Crypto Predictions for 2024 — From crypto asset manager BitwiseClick here to subscribe to our crypto newsletter.

While this type of phishing method has been known for some time, the magnitude of the losses in this incident was nonetheless shocking. This article will analyze the key aspects of the same-beginning-and-end-digits address phishing attack, track the flow of the funds, profile the hacker, and offer recommendations for preventing such phishing incidents.Key Points of the Attack1. Generating Phishing Addresses: The hacker preemptively generated a large number of phishing addresses. By deploying batch programs in a distributed manner and monitoring on-chain user activities, they launched a phishing attack using addresses that matched the victim’s intended transfer address in the first 4 and the last 6 digits (after removing the “0x”).2. Following Transactions: After the user initiated a transfer, the hacker immediately used the generated phishing address to follow with a transaction (sending 0 ETH to the user’s address) approximately 3 minutes later. This transaction then appeared in the user’s transaction history.3. Cast The Bait: Users often copy the most recent transaction details from their wallet’s history. Seeing the follow-up phishing transaction and not thoroughly checking the address copied, the victim mistakenly sent 1155 WBTC to the phishing address!Using the on-chain tracking tool MistTrack, it was discovered that the hacker had exchanged the 1155 WBTC for 22955 ETH and transferred them to the following 10 addresses:On May 7, the hacker began moving the ETH from these 10 addresses. The pattern of fund transfers generally involved leaving no more than 100 ETH in the current address, then roughly evenly splitting the remaining funds before transferring them to the next layer of addresses. Currently, these funds have not been exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or moved to any platforms. The following image shows the fund movement situation at the address 0x32ea020a7bb80c5892df94c6e491e8914cce2641.

Through extensive scanning, we also identified other related phishing incidents.Using the address 0xbba8a3cc45c6b28d823ca6e6422fbae656d103a6 from the second incident as an example and tracing its transaction fee addresses upwards, we found overlap with the fee origin address from the 1155 WBTC phishing incident, indicating they are likely operated by the same hacker.Further analysis of the hacker’s movement of other illicit gains (from the end of March to present) revealed another laundering pattern: converting ETH on-chain funds into Monero or transferring them across chains to Tron and then into suspected OTC addresses. This suggests a possibility that the hacker may use the same method to move the funds obtained from the 1155 WBTC phishing incident.Based on the threat intelligence network of SlowMist, we have identified several IPs suspected to be used by the hacker, originating from mobile stations in Hong Kong (the use of VPNs has not been ruled out):- 182.xxx.xxx.228- 182.xxx.xx.18- 182.xxx.xx.51- 182.xxx.xxx.64- 182.xxx.xx.154- 182.xxx.xxx.199- 182.xxx.xx.42- 182.xxx.xx.68- 182.xxx.xxx.66- 182.xxx.xxx.207It is noteworthy that even after stealing 1155 WBTC, the hacker does not seem to have any intention of ceasing their criminal activities.Following up on the previous collection of three initial phishing addresses (which provide transaction fees to numerous phishing addresses), a common characteristic is that the amount of the last transaction is significantly larger than previous ones. This indicates the hacker’s method of deactivating current addresses and transferring funds to new phishing addresses, with the three newly activated addresses still frequently transferring funds.In subsequent large-scale scans, we identified two deactivated parent addresses linked to this hacker, which we will not detail further here:- 0xa5cef461646012abd0981a19d62661838e62cf27- 0x2bb7848Cf4193a264EA134c66bEC99A157985Fb8As the investigation progressed, we questioned the source of the hacker’s ETH chain funds. After tracking by the SlowMist security team, it was found that the hacker initially conducted similar end-to-end digit phishing attacks on the Tron network. After profiting there, they targeted Ethereum chain users, transferring the proceeds from Tron to start phishing on the Ethereum chain. Below is an example of the hacker’s phishing activity on the Tron network:On May 4, a victim communicated the following message to the hacker on the blockchain: “You’ve won, brother. You can keep 10% and return the 90%. We can act like nothing happened. We both know $7 million is enough to live very comfortably, but $70 million will keep you up at night.”On May 5, the victim continued to publicly call out to the hacker on the blockchain, but has not yet received a response.Use of Whitelisting Mechanism: It is advisable for users to save trusted addresses in their wallet’s address book. For future transactions, users can select the target address directly from the wallet’s address book, which reduces the risk of sending funds to a malicious address.Enable Small Transaction Filtering in Wallets: Users should consider enabling the small transaction filtering feature in their wallets to block zero-value transactions, which are commonly used in phishing. The SlowMist security team analyzed such phishing techniques in 2022. Interested readers can view their reports on “Beware of TransferFrom Zero Transaction Scams” and “Beware of Same-End-Digit Airdrop Scams”.Carefully Verify Addresses: Users should verify not only the first 6 digits after the “0x” but also the last 8 digits of the address before confirming a transaction. Ideally, every digit of the address should be checked to ensure its accuracy.Test with Small Transactions: If the wallet in use only displays the first and last 4 digits of an address, consider making a small test transaction first. This method limits potential losses if the address is incorrect or malicious.This article has discussed phishing attacks that exploit addresses with matching beginning and end digits, analyzed the characteristics and fund transfer patterns of the hacker, and provided recommendations for preventing such attacks. The SlowMist security team reminds users that because blockchain operations are irreversible and blockchain data is immutable, it is crucial to meticulously verify addresses before conducting any transactions to avoid asset loss.The content of this article is supported by data from the anti-money laundering tracking system, MistTrack, and aims to analyze publicly available addresses and disclose the results of such analyses.

We kindly ask you to hold off on testing until our official announcement. For more details, check our release notes.An AWS customer was charged an exorbitant $1300 USD fee for its empty bucket, exposing AWS vulnerabilities and how buckets can be vulnerable to unauthorized request charges. The customer created an empty bucket for testing purposes, which received millions of authorized requests from a company using the same name as the test empty bucket the customer had created.This incident exposes a potential pitfall for AWS users: A customer created a private S3 bucket for testing purposes. Unknowingly to them, a popular open-source tool with a default configuration used the same name for storing backups. This resulted in a surge of unauthorized requests to the customer’s empty bucket, ultimately leading to a hefty $1,300 bill.Because of that, the misconfiguration caused the requests to be sent to this empty bucket, leading to exorbitant costs. Even though AWS refunded the client, they emphasized that it was an exception. This highlights how unclear and unpredictable fees can be on a centralized platform, leaving customers in the dark about how much they will be charged — risking paying substantially more than they planned and could afford.Rest assured, alternatives like Züs are designed with your security in mind. There are no hidden costs. There is no charge for requests, bandwidth, or egress. You do not have to worry about paying more for unauthorized requests because the price is paid upfront and only once. Service providers are committed to protecting you from such unexpected behaviors with restrictions that can be easily set on the blockchain to prevent bad actors or misconfigurations from ever posing a risk to you or your clients.Wrapping it up for today! Look forward to next week.Züs is a decentralized high-performance multi-cloud storage with high-security features and no vendor lock-in.Website | Telegram | Twitter | Discord | GitHub","tags":["Updates","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Crypto","Cloud Storage"],"author":"Tiago Souza"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/enrique-dans/using-the-blockchain-to-verify-email-addresses-sounds-smart-1606aaf1636b","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Blockchain is a logical, easy-to-use solution for verifying the identity of an email address.

While many efforts are invested in the security of smart contracts, in this research we chose to focus on another area that is less spoken — the security of the native code of the blockchain network. During our research we found some interesting finding that can be a good example of how a small coding mistake can be critical and very harmful when it happens in the core native code of a blockchain network.We are looking for a blockchain network that isn’t one of the Top-10 Blockchain projects, but has a market cap of hundreds of millions of dollars. Filtering the list of bounties in Imunnifi platform, we chose the ICON project (about 250M$ market cap).ICON network (https://icon.community/) is a blockchain project and cryptocurrency that aims to connect various blockchain networks, allowing them to interact with one another through a decentralized network called the ICON Republic. The ICON blockchain, also known as the ICON Network, was developed by the ICON Foundation, a South Korean blockchain technology company.Our first step was to deploy a local testnet using the official docker from the ICON website. The docker runs the validator code from a github repository called “goloop”. We initiated our local network by following this manual. For our tests, we created wallets using the genesis file.Having run the docker locally, we cloned the code from github, opened it with GoLand, and set up the remote debug connection to the local ICON docker. It allowed us to follow the transaction parsing process step by step and stop it using breakpoints whenever we wanted (see this guide for more information).The code of blockchain networks can be quite complex, with numerous attack surfaces. We decided to narrow our focus to the process of handling new transactions, which involves complex parsing logic. We chose this area because it deals directly with user input and can be activated through both the RPC interface and the P2P interface. Furthermore, we presumed that successfully exploiting a validator through this process would allow us to automatically exploit all validators via the gossip protocol.Upon delving into the flow of processing new transactions, we chose to focus on a particular transaction type: the deployment of a new smart contract.The ICON network supports 2 types of Smart Contracts (called “SCORE” in the ICON ecosystem — “Smart Contract on Reliable Environment”) — Java based and Python based. We started with the flow of deploying a Python SCORE.When the user sends a transaction for deploying a new python contract, the Python contract is packed in a zip file.Once the validator has completed a few checks (signature verification, gas, etc.), it stores the contract locally. The storing is done by the function “storePython” from the file “goloop\\service\\contract\\contractmanager.go” (see the code below).The function extracts the zip file to a temporary folder on the local file file-system of the validator. The function removes the shared prefix from the path of all the files but keeps the parts of the path that are not shared.For example, If the zip file contains the following files:So the function will remove the “hello_world” prefix but will keep the “internal” prefix in the second file. Then the function will join the “non-shared” path parts to the “tmpPath” (which is a temporary folder created for this SCORE ), create all the folders in the tree, and then create the file in the folder and write its content to it.Let’s see this flow in the code:Now, the function will go over all the files in the zip, and will check(line 398) if the file path is starting with the package name that we extracted from the path of the “package.json” file.(“pkgBase” which is “hello_world” in our example.)If the path starts with the package name, the function will remove this part from the path(line 401).The interesting part happend at line 420 — after performing some checks, the function will concat the path from the file name in the zip to the temp folder path. So if the path in the zip file is “hello_world/internal/init.py”, after the removal of the prefix and the concating, the file that will be created will be “tempDir/internal/init.py”.What makes it interesting? The function does not verify that the “non-shared” path prefix does not contain “../”. Therefore, if this path is concatenated with tmpPath, the attacker is able to change the location of the written file at his discretion.Additionally, the file will be created with 755 permissions, which means it will be able to execute.So we have an option to write a file whenever we want, with whatever content we wish, that has execution permissions. There are many possible ways to exploit it to RCE, but we focused on searching in the ICON official docker image. A quick search and we found that docker is configured to periodically run (using cronjob) all the files in the “/etc/periodic/15min/” directory.So for example, the attacker can set the path in the zip file to:hello_world/../../../../../../etc/periodic/15min/evilAnd the file content to#!/bin/shecho pwnd\u003e /pwnd#other evil stuffBy doing this, an evil file will be created in the validator docker at path “/etc/periodic/15min/evil”. Within 15 minutes, the bash script will run and we’ll get a RCE.It is also important to notice that the function will overwrite the file if it already exists. It means that another option to exploit the vulnerability can be to override other contracts code and then call them and withdraw all the funds.The evil zip file creation is done using this steps:./goloop/bin/goloop rpc sendtx deploy /mnt/c/repos/exploit_python_contract/hello.tar — uri http://localhost:9080/api/v3/icon — key_store wallet.json — key_password gochain — nid 0x9383b0 — step_limit 10000000000 — content_type application/zip — param name\u003dAliceWe did not test the exploit on the public testnet since we wanted to avoid malicious actors exploiting it, and because once the exploit is on the blockchain, anyone can watch it. As an alternative, we tested and successfully exploited it on our local testnet we created, which ran the latest version of the code (v1.3.3–1-g733a19d9).The full PoC is very simple:So we found a potential RCE in a blockchain network. This can be a disaster for the network, since we potentially can take control over all the validators, which means that we will have full control over the blockchain. We opened a new report in the Immunefi reporting system, under the Bug Bounty Program of ICON network, and after some hours of nerve wracking waiting, we got an annoying response:It basically said that even though the exploit worked on a local testnet, it would not work on the mainnet, and that’s why it was out of scope.So our first report was rejected, but we learned a lot about the ICON network and the code structure. Since the rejection said that Python contracts are Out-Of-Scope, our next step was to focus on the deployment process of the Java SCOREs.After creating a new Java SCORE and compiling the code to Java bytecode, the user should run the “jar-optimizer”, which is a tool provided by ICON Foundenton.The “optimizer” performs the following tasks:We performed many tests to try to bypass the class name filtering, but none of them succeeded. So we tried something else. Instead of creating an object of non-whitelisted class (like ProcessBuilder class, which can be used to start a new process) we will try to pass this object as a parameter to one of the functions that the contract exported.But the problem is that there is a verification for the types of the parameters that the exploited function can get. We tried to bypass this verification by creating a legitimate function that gets valid parameters, and after running the “jar-optimizer”, to manually change the type of the objects in the bytecode.We also needed to change the signature of the functions in the API file, since this file is used when the Java VM that used by ICON calls to function in contracts.This API file is encoded using MessagePack encoding, which is an efficient binary serialization format. So to change it, we looked for a nice and easy MsgPack editor. We found one that looks good and we made the changes that we wanted, saved the file and repacked the JAR file.After sending the transaction to deploy this contract, we received a transaction ID. We checked the status of the transaction (using icx_getTransactionResult) and saw that the transaction is “Executing”. We waited a few moments and checked again, and it still was “Executing”. So we tried to send another transaction and check its status, but we got a “Pending” as a response. At this moment we understood that the there is something interesting here.We went to the ICON docker and saw that there is exception:It seems that the MsgPack editor corrupted the API file when we used it. The question is, why is this exception not handled properly?The answer to this question lies in the code of parsing the API file. Let’s review the function “Validate” that validates the API file:We can see that the function is using another Function called MethodUnpacker.readFrom and handling a possible IOException. The function MethodUnpacker.readFrom calls to a function from the JAVA MsgPack lib, named unpackArrayHeader:The unpackArrayHeader function, according to the definition, also throws an IOException. But, if we take a closer we will see that this function also can throw another type of exception, by calling the unexpected function:This function actually returns an object of type MessagePackException which extends RuntimeException and not IOException:Due to the mistakenly corrupted API file, an unhandled exception occurred. Somehow, this creates an infinite loop in the validator’s code, preventing it from processing other transactions and generating new blocks. Moreover, the validator gossiped this transaction to all the other validators, which resulted in the whole network stopping from processing new transactions.We created another report on Immunefi dashboard. This one was shorter, but included the most important part — a working POC. Once we convinced the ICON team that this PoC was in fact a DOS attack, we negotiated the severity of these issues. In spite of the fact that we believed this issue could be classified as Critical (“Network not able to confirm new transactions”), we agreed to change the severity to High (categorized as “Disability to make a new block (no consensus working)”). And finally, we got paid for our bounty!Blockchain networks consist of extensive codebases that perform complex logic, harboring numerous potential issues. For bounty hunters, this domain is very attractive, and from my perspective, much more interesting than smart contracts. A functional debug environment streamlines and accelerates bug hunting significantly. Additionally, luck plays a crucial role as an essential tool in every bounty hunter’s arsenal.","tags":[],"author":"Elad Ernst","creation_date":"2024-04-07"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/samurai-starter/kip-protocol-node-sale-on-samurai-starter-78f6ec1324b6","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Tweet","summary":"We’re back and better than ever with a brand new AI node sale.

This time we’re partnering with KIP Protocol a project that boasts top-tier VC backing, founders with world-class academic credentials, and a clear vision for creating ‘the mission critical Web3 Base Layer for AI’.Incubated by Animoca Ventures (the VC arm of industry trendsetter Animoca Brands) and partnered with some massive industry players like OKX Wallet and Aethir, KIP Protocol is already well positioned to become a front-runner in the Web3 AI data arena. Already, their clients include respected institutions like Thailand’s Institute of Scientific and Technological Research and the National University of Singapore.What does all this mean for the Samurai family? Well, it means we will get the chance to purchase the licenses to run KIP Protocol Checker Nodes. These form the a crucial part of the infrastructure upon which the KIP ecosystem will flourish, and come with some juicy rewards as a result!We’ve managed to secure these nodes at an excellent price, and will be offering them through the Samurai Starter Launchpad on Monday, May 13.Read on to discover more reasons to be bullish on KIP Protocol, and find out exactly what you need to do to participate in the sale…Let’s cover the most important question first: what exactly are you buying when you participate in a node sale? Well, here’s the simplest answer possible: a node license is an NFT which allows you to generate passive income.If we want to get a little more complex: a node license is an NFT which gives you the right to run a Checker Node on the KIP Protocol network. This means a chance to generate passive income while at the same time ensuring the overall health of the KIP ecosystem.Checker Nodes do this by performing regular, automatic inspections of transaction data, service provider uptime, and all other activity flowing through the KIP network. As a reward for performing these checks, node operators will enjoy payouts comprising 20% of the entire $KIP token supply over the course of 3 years. Additional payments are also generated through network transaction fees, and bonuses which are paid out whenever your node detects improper activity on the network.These might sound like complex processes, but in practice operating a Checker Node is completely automatic. You can either run it on your own hardware using the dedicated KIP Protocol node client, run it on a VPS (Virtual Private Server), or just pass it off to a third-party NaaS (Node as a Service) provider who will handle the whole process for you. Shortly after the sale, we will provide a detailed guide on all three of these setup methods.Whatever you choose to do, you’ll be able to manage the whole process from KIP’s user-friendly dashboard where you can view your node’s metrics and claim your rewards. Your node license will also come with DAO voting rights, allowing you to participate in votes to settle disputes between entities on the platform (with even more rewards for doing so!).These node licenses will be non-transferrable for the first 6 months after TGE, after which they will be freely tradeable.Now that you understand what you’re buying when you participate in the KIP Checker Node sale on Samurai Starter, let’s take a closer look at the network which you’ll be contributing to.KIP Protocol is building a layer of foundational Web3 infrastructure where AI data providers, model providers, and application developers can securely transact.What might that look like in practice? Well, first a firm which builds complex AI models might list their products on the KIP Protocol network to easily monetize their work. Through the platform, these AI models can then be licensed by developers looking to build user-facing apps such as AI agents.In order to optimize these AI applications, developers also require large sets of data to train the models on specific tasks — these they can also access via feeds from the various data providers integrated with the KIP Protocol network. In essence, it’s a next-gen Web3 framework where all of the players in the AI industry can seamlessly and securely transact with one another.KIP Protocol handles the interchange of data, transfer of funds, and records of data ownership for all of these processes.It’s a win-win for everyone involved: application builders get quick and reliable access to the models and data they need, while the providers of these models and data can easily monetise their work through the power of Web3. The latter simply deploy their creations onto the network as ‘Knowledge Assets’ and receive revenues directly to their wallet whenever these assets are utilized.And throughout the entire process, each entity retains intellectual property over their creations, and full control over how their data is licensed. This is achieved through the use of NFTs (ERC 3525 standard), which are minted to represent the Knowledge Assets deployed onto the network, as an immutable proof of ownership.In order to do this, Knowledge Asset creators must also must lock a certain amount of $KIP tokens, which act as collateral to ensure they will properly fulfill their obligations while operating on the network.This is where the Checker Nodes come in. Their job is to periodically ping the API endpoint of these AI suppliers and service providers to check three crucial things:If the node detects irregularities with any of the above, it passes the problem on to other nodes to be double-checked. If the nodes achieve a consensus, then the $KIP tokens staked by the asset provider are slashed as punishment (with the seized funds going directly to the node operators who uncovered the discrepancy).This ensures the clients transacting on the KIP Protocol network can trust the credibility and quality of the suppliers they’re interacting with, while incentivizing suppliers to ensure their feeds are accurate and consistent. If any further disputes arise between clients and service providers on the network, it’s the node operators who step in to settle the matter.Each node license comes with DAO voting rights which can be used to vote on the outcome of these disputes, with bonus rewards being paid out for participation. This is a completely optional (but potentially lucrative) aspect of running a KIP Checker Node.A high level of decentralization is essential to ensuring that this system operates effectively, with no one point of failure. In order to achieve this, a maximum of 50,000 of these nodes will be issued.For a more detailed breakdown on the specific tasks each of these nodes is entrusted with, see here.Now onto the part that everybody’s most interested in: the $KIP token rewards. These tokens are paid out as passive income to node operators for running a Checker Node and contributing to the health of the network. Node operator rewards come from various sources:There is no cliff attached to these rewards — $KIP rewards will begin being generated 7 days after TGE, and paid out to operators every 15 minutes. You’ll be able to claim your rewards whenever you want, with a 30-day cooldown after each withdrawal.All of this is managed from the KIP node operator dashboard. Here you’ll be able to view all of the checks your node has performed over the past 24 hours, the rewards received from each individual income source, and the total amount you’ve yet to claim.Important Note: KYC is not required to participate in the node license sale, however it will be required in order to claim node operator rewards. This makes residents of the United States, Cuba, Iran, Syria, and other jurisdictions ineligible to claim rewards.The KIP team is made up of respected academics in the field of AI research, alongside seasoned Web3 industry professionals. They’re fully doxxed, with demonstrable track records of working with top-tier clients in government and industry. Their combined expertise led KIP Protocol to a gold-medal finish in the 2023 Chainlink Hackathon, against a pool of 18,500 other competitors!In addition, the KIP family extends to include a host of top-tier VC investors, over 200 KOLs, and clients including respected tech and education institutions. Take a look at the depth and breath of the extended KIP network already!Several top industry players have already begun integrating KIP Protocol with their tech. For example, Animoca’s Open Campus — the worldwide Web3 education hub launched by Animoca Brands — is using KIP Protocol to create AI-driven applications and revenue streams to power their platform.KIP Protocol has some big plans for the future. For an overview of everything they have lined up, take a look at the roadmap graphic below.Here’s a few brief details on some of our top highlights:The $KIP token will be used throughout the KIP Protocol network, powering everything from transactions to Knowledge Asset deployment. Its utilities within the network include:The total supply of $KIP will be 10,000,000,000 tokens, with an initial circulating supply of 526,000,000. TGE is set to follow later in Q2, and Checker Node rewards will begin being paid out just one week afterwards.These rewards will be drawn from the Ecosystem Fund, with 20% of supply set aside for node operators, to be released throughout the first three years of the project. For the rest of the distribution breakdown, see below:KIP Protocol plans to list the $KIP token on several top-tier exchanges (and given the strength of their backing, we foresee these being truly top-tier). More details on these will follow in the coming months!The launch price and final launch FDV will depend on several factors, including the total number of Checker Nodes sold.So what precisely do you need to do to get in on this action? The short answer: get yourself over to the Samurai Starter launchpad at 11:00 UTC on Monday, May 13.

Almost every element on Mande Network depends on a trusted set of users participating in the “DApps” on the network.Therefore, Mande Networks tokenomics— rewards users proportional to the Credibility score “CRED” they acquire which is calculated based on the “stakes” they can garner from other networks users. On Mande network “CRED” represents “Trustworthy-ness” of a user.Together vote casting users help choose the most credible users in “Proof-of-Credibility”. $MAND is rewarded to the users based on trustworthiness.$MAND Token Utility :The $MAND token, with its three-fold utility, functions within its ecosystem in the following ways:1.Staking on Governors: $MAND tokens allow holders to participate in governance decisions of the Mande RollApp(L2) by staking on governors. Governors vote on your behalf on proposals, suggest changes, or influence the strategic direction of the project. Staking on governors will lead to staking rewards akin to DPoS(Delegated Proof of Stake) chains.2. Network Gas Fees: $MAND tokens are used to pay for transaction fees within the network.3. Credibility Stacking: Users use $MAND tokens as ‘stake’ to vote on the the credibility of other users. Using credibility staking a user can increase the reputation score(CRED)of another user within the ecosystem by staking his $MAND.Mande Network RollApp(L2) will have a genesis supply of 20 Million $MAND. Allocated as per the table below.The token supply will be following an inflationary schedule to facilitate rewards for Governance staking, Credibility(CRED) staking, Ecosystem grants and Team pool.Starting with 54%, the inflation follows a halving schedule every 2 years. With an initial supply of 20 million $MAND tokens the ecosystem will reach an asymptotic maximum supply of 100 million $MAND tokens over the period of 20 years.Newly released tokens will be distributed as follows :-For every block 30% of the tokens released will form a pool to reward users proportional to their CRED on the network.Rewards will be distributed to the users by a DApp managed by the Mande foundation at https://app.mande.network/For every block 30% of the tokens released will be distributed to MAND stakers who stake on governers of the Mande RollApp. Staking on governors will lead to staking rewards akin to staking on validators on L1 chains such as Dymension.For every block 20% of the tokens released will go towards forming the ecosystem grants pool which will be given out as grants to development teams that build DApps on Mande Network. All grants will be voted via governance proposals.20% of released tokens per block are towards the core team building and managing Mande network. The team also runs the RollApp sequencer node.Most importantly, in order to maintain strong decentralisation, in a situation where the initial development team is no longer the primary development team for the network, the chain can choose to reclaim any unreleased tokens from the development team and redirect them to the community pool or towards a new set of development teams via a governance proposal.This token model is created to bootstrap the Mande Network with well-aligned incentives for key stakeholders and contributors. However, Mande Network is first and foremost project to implement Proof-of-Credibility.It will become clearer over time how the token model needs to evolve to best support the needs of the project. The Mande Labs development team already has features in development that are expected to have an impact on the optimal token model design.Thus, the token model is intended to be adapted and updated by the community over time. Such adjustments to the model can be proposed and voted on through on-chain governance.$MAND holders should feel empowered to change the token model of the chain as necessary to support their vision for the platform.","tags":["Tokenomics","Mande","Blockchain","Cosmos","Dymension"],"author":"Mande Network","creation_date":"2022-11-04"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@raca3/web3-games-will-be-the-biggest-driver-in-the-adoption-of-cryptocurrencies-8d7188bbce96","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","title":"Web3 games will be the biggest driver in the adoption of cryptocurrencies","detailed_content":"Since the 2017 bull market, blockchain games have been gaining more and more space in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as drivers of a new gaming model, in which it is possible to ‘earn to play’ (play-to-earn) and, more than than that, owning your assets ‘in game’.Recently, Jeff Zirlin of Sky Mavis highlighted the revolutionary potential of Web3 games to drive mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and create economic freedom globally.

Once the Holesky RPC client syncs it can be used as http:// and ws:// L1 endpoints for the Taiko Hekla node. This is a detailed guide, also including hints and tips of Linux commands for non-Linux experts. Hope you enjoy it and share with others.You can also follow me on Twitter or chat with me on Discord (0xthan0s)Step 1a: Get a VPSIf you want to run a Taiko Hekla proposer node then a VPS will work. However, for Taiko Hekla prover nodes the requirement is quite different. A prover node requires Intel SGX enabled processors. The ideal configuration is 8 cores and 16GB memory; the bare minimum is 4 cores and 8GB memory. Unfortunately, these processors are not available on VPS servers but rather on bare metal options. See here for a list of SGX compatible processors. In addition, the SGX machine needs to have a compatible FMSPC. For those that wish to run a Taiko Hekla prover node I highly recommend to be 100% sure that the SGX machine is FMSPC compatible. Step 10 of this guide will be dedicated to detailing the steps of enabling a prover successfully.For setting up a Taiko Hekla proposer, I will use a VPS. If you have a VPS server available this is great and you can skip to step 2. if not, I recommend Contabo. They have good options of VPS servers with a good value for money. You can see the available options here. For this guide I used a CLOUD VPS 5 (16 vCPU Cores, 64 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD, 3 Snapshots). 2TB SSD are required for storage, because the Holesky client databases are so IOPS-heavy. I will also utilize the three snapshots that the VPS offers, to mark recovery points of my installation. In case I make a mistake in the process, I can have a recovery point.Now you need to use the IP address of your server and an SSH client/terminal to access. Personally I use Termius. It provides some great features even in the free version and is available for desktop and mobile. You can download Termius here.On Termius, select Hosts -\u003e New Host -\u003e Type in the IP address of your server (in my example 000.000.000.000 but replace this with yours). Then give it a name like “ETH Holesky RPC + Taiko Server”; you will logon as root and also type the password that you provided in the previous step when you registered your new VPS with Contabo. Click connect.This is how it will look when you logon for the first time.Step 1b: Update Linux kernelBefore proceeding check the linux kernel version with command: uname -rLinux kernel, the base component of the OS, needs to be 6.0 or above for EDMM (Enclave Dynamic Memory Management), which Taiko nodes require. To update the kernel on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS , first run the super update command:Once completed then update the kernel with command:This process will take a few minutes. Once completed and back into root prompt, reboot the machine with command:Once the system reboots, reconnect with Termius and check the first line of the screen. Your kernel should be now updated.Tip: If you want to see all available Linux kernel versions run command:Step 2: Add User holeskyThe Ethereum Holesky client cannot be executed with user root. So for this purpose, we need to setup a new user which for instance, could be named holesky. To add user holesky, run command:The system will ask you to choose a password for this new user. Enter one, then confirm. Finally the system will ask for some additional non-important details (full name, room, phones, etc). Press enter to move to each next one.Now we need to give sudo privileges to this new user. On Ubuntu, the easiest way to grant sudo privileges to a user is by adding the user to the “sudo” group. Members of “sudo” group can execute any command as root via sudo and prompted to authenticate themselves with their password when using sudo. To give the sudo privileges to user holesky run the following command:This concludes step 2.Step 3: Docker InstallationWith the Ethereum Holesky client in perspective we will install Docker with user holesky. In case you are user root, switch to user holesky. To do this run command:Continue with the following command (the system may ask for user holesky password). Enter the password and execute.Note: the sudo apt-get update command is the most essential command in Linux to keep a system healthy and up-to-date. This command installs and downloads all the latest package information available for the packages currently installed on the system.To install Docker we need to first setup the Docker repo by running the following batch of commands. You can copy and paste the batch of commands and these will be executed sequentially.After the batch of commands is executed we need to install the latest Docker version by running the following command:Select Y and enter when prompted. This process will take a few minutes. Finally to verify Docker installation run command:This will print a confirmation message “Hello from Docker!” and exit.Post-Installation Steps (applies as we installed Docker as non-root user)The Docker daemon binds to a Unix socket, not a TCP port. By default it’s the root user that owns the Unix socket, and other users can only access it using sudo. The Docker daemon always runs as the root user.If you don’t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group.Create the Docker group with command:Most probably you will receive a message that the group already exists. Fine, it’s always good to check. Add user holesky to the Docker group with command:Now switch to user root with command su - root password etc. and switch immediately back to user holesky with command su - holesky. Now check that you can run Docker commands with user holesky without usingsudo:Docker is now installed. Next step Git.Step 4: Git InstallationTo install Git with user holesky, run the following command:Select Y and enter when prompted. This process will take a few minutes. Verify Git installation with command:Step 5: Holesky Client ConfigurationNow let’s get the Holesky client up and running. First we need to clone eth-docker. With user holesky, run command:Once cloning finishes, you are now in eth-docker directory. Run command:Answer “yes” to both questions.Now run command:Fantastic! The Holesky archive node is almost ready.Now we need to configure the Eth Docker. Have an Ethereum wallet address handy here. Run command:The pink configuration screen will appear. First, select Holesky network (Holešovice is a district in the north of Prague situated on a meander of the River Vltava. It is the coolest and most vibrant district of the city).Select Ethereum RPC node.Select Lighthouse (Rust).Select Geth (Go).Select the recommended value. Click here for a list of other Ethereum Beacon Chain checkpoint sync endpoints.The consensus layer client will connect to the mev-boost container. So “Yes” to using MEV Boost.For MEV relays, the relay value is not visible in this screen here but it does populate in the configuration file. So press enter to proceed. MEV relays can be retrieved from here.Yes Grafana is cool and we want to use it. We will see in a nice dashboard how the Holesky client syncs and operates.Here put the address of an ETH wallet. Always choose a test wallet. After confirming the wallet, ethd terminates with exit and the below screen.Important-don’t start the client yet: We have one very critical change to do in the configuration file plus one more related to Contabo VPS only. The configuration of the Holesky client is stored in file .env. In this file we need to change the following configuration parameters:To do these changes we need to edit the configuration file with the nano editor. So with user holesky and under directory eth-docker run command:To expose the node’s RPC ports (for a Taiko node to make calls to it), we need to append el-shared.yml to the list of files in the COMPOSE_FILE variable of the .env file. Go to line #3 of the configuration file and type in “:el-shared.yml”.Then edit the configuration file, around line #144 and change the value of variable ARCHIVE_NODE to “false” (CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit), finally start the Holesky client again with command:Good to go!The change related to Contabo VPS only: To address the known issue of head jamming, change value CL_P2P_PORT (around line 83) from “9000” to “7000”. Taiko Admins on Discord also recommend to change PRYSM_PORT and PRYSM_UDP_PORT values from “9000” to “7000” as well.Once all required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit.\nCongratulations!!! We are now ready to start the Holesky client.\nIf you are using the system with user root you need to revert to user holesky. To do this, run command (password may be required):Then execute command ls to see folders and files under user holesky.All files and folders utilized by the Holesky client are in directory eth-docker. To open the directory execute command:Check the contents with command ls and locate eth docker file ethd.Start the client with command:Now the client will take sometime to sync. We can follow the sync process and also check operational statistics with the Grafana dashboard.Step 6: Grafana dashboard for Holesky client (port 3000)The dashboard is by default open to port 3000. Open a browser, insert your server’s IP address add a column and the port 3000 and press enter.The browser will open the Grafana logon screen. The default user name is admin and the default password is again admin. Grafana will request you to choose your own password.Once you enter Grafana environment select Home, then Dashboards. You can use the default eth-docker dashboard. I also use the ETH Docker Logs dashboard.Grafana eth-docker dashboard looks like this. Watch for the blocks increasing and synchronizing and the chain head having this triangular shape. Once the client reaches current block, then synchronization is achieved.The current block of Eth Holesky can be seen here. Below image shows the client synchronized with the blockchain.Holesky client: Stopping, Starting, Updating and Log ReviewingHere are a few commands for service management and log reviews of the Holesky client. As always, add sudo to these commands if the user is not part of the docker group.Step 7: Run a Taiko Hekla NodeIn this guide I will install the Taiko node with user root. The prerequisites of Docker and Git are already installed in previous steps. There are two methods to run a Taiko node: with stn and with simple-taiko-node. For the purpose of this guide I will run the Taiko node with simple-taiko-node. If you wish to tryout the stn method revert to Taiko Docs.First we need to clone simple-taiko-node from Github. Run command:Once this command completes then open directory simple-taiko-node by running the following command:Now copy the configuration file with command:Now we need to edit the configuration file and set the L1 Holesky archive client endpoints and the beacon client. On Taiko Discord you can see the pinned beacon client.So to edit the configuration file run command:Change the two L1 endpoints in the configuration file, as per below:L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP\u003dhttp://192.168.1.1:8545L1_ENDPOINT_WS\u003dws://192.168.1.1:8546Make sure to replace 192.168.1.1 of my example above, with the IP of YOUR Holesky client.Also change the L1_BEACON_HTTP\u003dhttp://unstable.holesky.beacon-api.nimbus.team/Once the required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit. Now we are ready to start the Taiko Node.Note: In case you ran a Taiko node previously, make sure to first remove the old volumes with command:As user root, start the node with command:Once the node starts, check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Taiko L2 with the following command copy and paste as-is.This command should return the chainId as 0x28c61\n{ “jsonrpc”: “2.0”, “id”: 1, “result”: “0x28c61” }Also check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Taiko L2 / L3 block from the Execution Layer client:If the blockNumber response value is 0 or not growing, check the Taiko L2 logs with command:Step 8: Grafana dashboard for Taiko Hekla node (port 3001)The dashboard is by default open to port 3001. Open a browser, insert your server’s IP address add a column and the port 3001 and press enter.Grafana L2ExecutionEngine dashboard looks like this. Watch for the blocks increasing and synchronizing and the chain head having this triangular shape. Once the client reaches current block, then synchronization is achieved. The current block of Taiko Hekla can be seen here.Once the node is synced then we can proceed to additional steps to enable the node as a proposer (this guide will be updated shortly).Taiko node: Stopping, Starting, Updating and Log ReviewingHere are a few commands for service management and log reviews of the Taiko node. As always, add sudo to these commands if the user is not part of the docker group.Step 9: Enable a Taiko Hekla ProposerOnce the node from the previous step syncs with the Taiko blockchain we can proceed to the next step and enable a Taiko Hekla proposer node. The steps are very simple to achieve. It only requires a a few changes in the configuration file. So in directory simple-taiko-node run command:In the configuration file we need to change the following configuration parameters:Once all required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the configuration file and then CTRL-X to exit. Now we are ready to restart the Taiko Node in order for the parameters to be activated. As user root, stop the node with command:The start the node with command:You can also use the restart sequence which combines both commands:You can also check blocks proposed (with success or fail) using holesky etherscan. Copy and paste the proposer wallet address.In Holesky etherscan you can see blocks proposed successfully (in green rectangle) and blocks proposed with fail. Failed propose blocks means that the proposer tried to propose but another proposer did it faster and cheaper, hence the failure. You need to DYOR and understand what works better for you and the market. Finally, on holesky etherscan you can also see the transaction fee in ETH. Happy proposing!!Taiko Proposer: Stopping, Starting, and Log ReviewingHere are a few commands for service management and log reviews of the Taiko Proposer node. As always, add sudo to these commands if the user is not part of the docker group.The DojonodeWolfez and Helios of the Taiko team created this beautiful node monitoring dashboard, where you can see at a glance, everything that matters around your proposer or prover: this is the Dojonode.To install the Dojonode, execute the below transactions.To call the Dojonode, just type the IP address of your node on the browser and add port 7744. Then just click on the 📡 button and change “localhost” to the IP address of your node. You can also add the wallet so the node can monitor proposed blocks, proved blocks and the balance of ETH in Holesky testnet and Hekla testnet.See here for more information about the Dojonode. Enjoy and give a shoutout to Wolfez and Helios.Step 10: Enable a Taiko Hekla ProverThis is going to be a lengthy one, as enabling a prover requires a lot of steps. First things first, for an SGX AND FMSPC compatible machine I have chosen OVH. For the purpose of this guide I have used a Rise-3 dedicated server. If you choose OVH, then before everything else you need to enable SGX. This is available as an option on the server management page. Once enabled, you will have to reboot. Once the green “Enabled” indication is visible you are good to go.Prerequisites from previous steps:In this guide, I will install the Taiko Hekla prover with user root.\nBy default, OVH does not allow login to the root account via SSH. You will only have access with a generic user named “ubuntu”. In case you proceed with an OVH server, then run the following commands one by one:Now you will be able to connect your OVH machine with user root.Note: Intel SGX is a technology that requires extensive configuration, with setups varying considerably based on the attestation type (EPID, ECDSA). Although Taiko team has made efforts to simplify the development environment setup, some prerequisites are too complex to automate fully with Dockerfiles.It’s important, however, to understand these steps, even though machines like the OVH Rise-3, are proven to be SGX/FMSPC compatible. Analyzing the configuration process will provide deeper insights and understanding.Step 10.1: Install cpuid toolTo verify if the CPU is SGX-enabled, we need to install the cpuid tool. So run command:Then run command:If you see the below result then the CPU is SGX-enabled.Step 10.2: Create an Intel PCS accountAs per Taiko instructions, the ECDSA attestation requires a subscription to the Intel PCS service here (instructions here). This subscription will provide us with a primary API key and a secondary API key. These keys are required and will be used in the next steps.Step 10.3: Determine FMSPC support | Install PCKIDRetrievalToolThis is a mandatory step to ensure that the SGX-enabled machine is supported by Raiko. Currently the supported FMSPCs are only:\n00606A000000\n00A067110000\n00906ED50000To install the tool run the following commands (enter “Y” where asked):Once the tool is installed then run the below command to retrieve FMSPC.You will be asked to enter the Intel PCS API key from step 10.2. Here you can enter either the primary API key or the secondary API key. You will also be asked for a pccs password; just press Enter.You will receive the FMSPC key.Step 10.4: Install GramineAs per Taiko team, Raiko leverages Intel SGX via Gramine. Here you can see the available distributions. In our case we will install Gramine for Ubuntu 22.04 with a Bash script. You can find more information about scripts here.To install Gramine, we will create a script called install_gramine.sh and in this file we will insert all the installation commands, plus two extra lines to mark the beginning and end of the script. Copy and paste the script as below.The script file, install_gramine.sh, is now ready to be executed with the below command. This will take a few minutes. Respond with “Y” when required.Gramine is now installed.Step 10.5: Additional installationsExecute the command below to prepare the prover with some additional required installations.Step 10.6: Generate PCCS certificates and edit default.json fileThis step is related to SGX-specific requirements about configuring PCCS (Provisioning Certificate Caching Service). PCCS retrieves PCK certificates during runtime and then caches them in the local database. PCCS uses the same http interfaces as Intel PCS.To generate the certificate run the below commands one by one. Note that the firsst openssl command will require some additional information. You can ignore all, perhaps enter an email when requested.How the output looks.During the next step the system will generate the below error. As per the Taiko team it should be ignored.But in case you have coding error PTSD (like myself) and would like to install the latest version of nodejs and avoid the error, below are the commands to achieve this.You can also check the installed nodejs version with command: node -v\nNext run the below commands to generate the default.json file and then copy it. There might be an error related to cracklib-runtime, ignore it.Now let’s edit the default.json file, which you can see with the ls command.We need to edit four parameters in the default.json file. You can edit default.json with command:hosts: replace it with \"0.0.0.0\"\nApiKey: Use either the Intel PCS primary or secondary key you obtained from step 10.2.\nUserTokenHash: Here you just have to execute command echo -n \"user_password\" | sha512sum | tr -d \u0027[:space:]-\u0027), where you can replace “user _password” with any string.In this case, I executed the command as-is, with no change. Take the value 6ae2d3bfb3b95517b358fcdb29……02920ddeb1a6c6df4e8a00 and paste to UserTokenHash.AdminTokenHash: Similarly, here you just have to execute command echo -n \"admin_password\" | sha512sum | tr -d \u0027[:space:]-\u0027. Again, I executed the command as-is, with no change. Take the value 31a556961f3438f9f632ca27812d……97937c28310a7ab62a9ae1c15d96d69 and paste to AdminTokenHash.Once the required values are changed press CTRL-S to save the default.json file and then CTRL-X to exit.Very important, run the below command to modify the permissions of default.jsonFinally, create the below directories, one by one.Step 10.7: Clone and Bootstrap RaikoNow let’s clone Raiko and build the docker images. Firstly, execute the below command.Now before building the image, we need to check parameter “sgx.max_threads” in the configuration file “sgx-guest.docker.manifest.template” and make sure the value is “32”. Execute the next set of commands.You should be able to see this fileEdit the file as below.If the value “sgx.max_threads” is “32” then CTRL-X and exit. If it is “16” then change to “32” and then CTRL-S to save and CTRL-X to exit.Once this change is done, then we can build the image. Execute below commands and then lay back and watch the show. This will take sometime.Once complete you will see the screen as above. Now run the following command.You should be able to see at least the following two images: gcr.io/evmchain/raiko and gcr.io/evmchain/pccs.Now you are ready to bootstrap Raiko. Execute the next command.If everything is executed correctly then raiko-init exited with code 0 and you should be able to see a Public key, an Instance address and a quote.Bootstrapping should also generate a bootstrap.json which contains the relavant information and you can check with the following command.It should look like the below example. The “quote” is quite a lengthy string and we will need this later on.Now Raiko is ready to be executed through Docker. Next step to attest the prover on-chain, receive some TTKOh and start proving!Step 10.8: Perform on-chain remote AttestationAs a first step, let’s clone taiko-mono with command:Then open directory “protocol”:Now run the below commands:And continue with the below commands:The compiler will inform you in the end if everything is successful.At this stage you need to define the private key of the wallet that you are going to use on this prover. Always use a new fresh wallet. Run the below command filling your private key.Next step open folder script and look for config_dcap_sgx_verifier.shAs per Taiko Docs, we need to compare the below three values with what is in the config_dcap_sgx_verifier.shscript. These three values are:SGX_VERIFIER_ADDRESS\u003d0x532EFBf6D62720D0B2a2Bb9d11066E8588cAE6D9 ATTESTATION_ADDRESS\u003d0xC6cD3878Fc56F2b2BaB0769C580fc230A95e1398 PEM_CERTCHAIN_ADDRESS\u003d0x08d7865e7F534d743Aba5874A9AD04bcB223a92ETo compare we need to view the config_dcap_sgx_verifier.shscript. We can do this as follows. Edit the script with command:As you can see from the above screenshot the values match. Now CTRL-X to exit the script without saving.Once the values are confirmed we move to the next step where we will utilize the quote that we obtained earlier, when we bootstrapped Raiko.… this is a work in progress! If you would like to continue on your own, you can consult the very detailed documentation on Taiko Docs.","tags":["Holesky Testnet","Taiko","Blockchain"],"author":"0xThanos","creation_date":"2024-01-28"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@trex20/introducing-trex20-gamified-venture-revolutionizing-allocation-security-and-fun-f2bee36a9174","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi), innovation is not just a goal; it’s a necessity.

Trex20 is ready to shake things up with its latest feature: the Gamified Venture on BRC20 and EVM chains. This groundbreaking addition promises to revolutionize how communities/individuals secure allocation, injecting an unprecedented level of excitement and engagement into the process.Traditionally, participating in Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) and securing allocations has been a straightforward but often mundane process. Users typically stake tokens or simply rush to grab their share on a first-come, first-served basis. However, not just with staking or FCFS allocations but Trex20 is flipping the script by introducing multiple avenues through which users can secure allocations, each more thrilling than the last.For those who believe in the power of commitment, the Stake-to-Whitelist feature offers a pathway to allocation security. By staking tokens on the platform, users can earn the coveted whitelist status, ensuring their participation in upcoming IDO rounds.Prepare for a gaming experience like never before with the Play-to-Secure feature. Here, users can compete against one another, striving to climb the leaderboard and secure their allocation through sheer skill and determination. This gamified approach injects an element of fun and competitiveness into the allocation process, enticing users to engage like never before.Owning Trex20 Ordinals NFTs opens yet another avenue to allocation security. NFT holders enjoy privileged access to allocations, further incentivizing participation in the platform’s ecosystem.For those who prefer a more direct approach, the Pay-to-Secure feature offers a streamlined option to secure allocations. Users can simply make a payment in $TX20 to lock in their share, ensuring a hassle-free experience.Of course, Trex20 hasn’t forgotten its roots. The classic first-come, first-served model remains an option for users who prefer a swift and straightforward approach to allocation.By incorporating these diverse and engaging features, Trex20 is not only redefining how allocations are secured but also transforming the entire experience of participating in IDO rounds. With Gamified Venture, every user becomes an active participant in the excitement and thrill of token launches.But the innovation doesn’t stop there. Trex20 is committed to maximizing the utility of its native TX20 token and Trex20 Ordinals NFTs. Partial profits in tokens will be shared with NFT holders, rewarding their loyalty and investment in the platform. Additionally, token burns from payments received in tokens during Gamified Venture participation will contribute to making the TX20 token deflationary, further enhancing its value proposition.In essence, the Gamified Venture represents more than just a feature update; it symbolizes Trex20’s ongoing commitment to innovation and user-centric design as the platform continues to evolve and grow to push its developments beyond mundane.Get ready to level up your allocation game with Trex20’s Gamified Venture.

These upgrades are designed to provide project teams with more tools to manage their sales effectively and to ensure equitable distribution among participants.To address community feedback and ensure fair access to token sales, we are implementing a maximum purchase limit per address during public sales. This feature is crucial for preventing the accumulation of a significant portion of tokens by a few participants, which can negatively affect the distribution and health of the project.Benefits Include:We’re introducing vesting with a cliff option for token sales, providing projects with the flexibility to set up short or long-term vesting periods. This feature is particularly useful for managing the market impact post-sale and aligning token release schedules with project milestones.Implementation Uses:This new vesting functionality is especially beneficial for projects that cannot launch in a modular fashion. Such projects often need complete development before launch, requiring substantial funding secured across multiple stages.Advantages of Multi-Round Sales:With the Rhone upgrade, storage rent fees are dropping to 0.1 ALPH from the previous 1 ALPH. We will make the necessary preparations to implement this change as soon as Rhone is live, ensuring that bidding on launches will require locking up 0.1 ALPH instead of the current 1 ALPH.This update represents our commitment to improving AlphPad’s infrastructure to better serve the community and project teams.Next Steps:These updates are part of our ongoing effort to refine and enhance the user experience on AlphPad, ensuring it remains a leading platform for launching new and innovative projects on the Alephium blockchain.","tags":["Launchpad","Alephium","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Smart Contracts"],"author":"AlphPad"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@gilescrouch/the-internet-is-still-wide-open-46726a9692d0","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The internet is far more open and creative than is often portrayed. It’s overflowing in fact and that’s wonderful. Here’s why.","title":"The Internet Is Still Wide Open","detailed_content":"N\nearly 2 million years ago, we figured out how to turn a boring old lump of rock into a tool. Quite an astonishing feat of brain power. As a result, rather than tearing off meat with our hands we could slice up some very nice t-bone steaks. We somehow also knew cooked meat was not just tastier, but better for us.We also figured out that the more of our kind we shared this information with, the better our chances for survival. Our distant ancestors knew there was safety in numbers. So we evolved methods of communication; language, cave drawings. Arriving to where we are today with the single biggest, most complex communication technology we’ve ever built; the internet.Some will say that the original idea of the internet, to be a free, wide open space for ideas and innovations has gone the way of the DoDo bird. Extinct. Not really.What has changed is the evolution of the internet. It was largely open and wild, the domain of the hippies who grew tired of communes and a lack of proper showers and came back closer to the urban core of San Francisco and started playing with computers.All the communications technologies we create evolve. Just like us.Even thousands of years ago, we created moving images on cave walls. Using some form of dyes and flickering flames. Think YouTube and TikTok is cool? Yep, they are. But neither would be here today without our ancestors, thousands of years ago, who used pigments and torch flames to create the first TikTok or YouTube videos of what we see today.When the printing press arrived on the scene around 500 years ago, it was a similar wild west. Creative entrepreneurs set up simple presses in their own shops. An entire ecosystem grew up around printing presses for ink, press manufacturing, tools, typefaces. The same happened with the internet; laptops, tablets, smartphones and of course, software.Humans are inherently social and innovative animals. We invented communications technologies because it made it easier to share ideas, to find common ground in our varied realities. The better our communications tools, the more organised we became, the more we could evolve as a species and evolve our technologies.As each communication technology evolved, so did our societies and how we managed communication/information. For many years, radio stations were a disorganized mish-mash, especially in the United States. Regulations came along fairly quickly and societal norms were imposed. Radio stations formed networks and became in effect, walled gardens.The same happened with the printing press and television networks. Telephone networks became huge and conglomerates formed, leading in some places, to monopolies. Hence the break-up of AT\u0026T in America.Today we talk how the internet has become a place of walled gardens with Tech Giants thundering over the digital landscape keeping any trespassers at bay. Fortunately, that’s mostly a fairy tale. Yes, there are walled gardens and the giants will, at times, let you play in someone elses sandbox. For a fee. Usually your personal data.But the internet is still a very creative place. It is more wild west than not. If we think of the internet in terms of a map comparable to the real world, we might say that the Tech Giants have built glittering cities in parts of the world. WeChat is like Beijing. Facebook and Google are San Francisco and New York. Snap is Toronto. Between these shimmering cities remain untamed, vast open spaces.These wild spaces are where ideas are constantly sparking into life, like sprites in a forest. Sometimes they are created in rigid spaces in the cities of the giants. More often, they are born on the edges, in the wilds. In decentralized spaces, the fediverse. By humans of all walks of life, from all cultures and societies.Some call parts of these wild spaces the Dark Web, where bandits lurk, like the bandits of old that preyed on traveling caravans along trade routes. Yes, there are nefarious denizens of the Dark Web. But there are lots of good people in those haunts. Creating, ideating. Imagining new futures.There are many open spaces where code and ideas get generated. Blockchain, the concept of decentralisation and crypto that leverages blockchain and other technologies.These are far more than just technologies. They are arguments, debates and social statements to begin with. They are created by people who imagine a different world, a new or more innovative way of doing things.There are far more interesting, exciting and innovative ideas being generated because of the internet than there are nefarious, nasty things. If one steps back from tech industry news, explores online communities not just on sites like Reddit, but fediverse sites like Mastodon and others, they are like percolating coffee pots of ideas.Some of those ideas will evolve and spill over into society and become new businesses and services. Cultures will explore them and decide if they want them and if they do, how they want to adapt them to make them work.But to claim that the internet has become completely corporatized is to miss the conversations taking place, the bubbling of ideas and the ones turning into something new and meaningful.","tags":[],"author":"Giles Crouch | Digital Anthropologist","creation_date":"2023-07-31"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@playhoneyland/certified-beekeepers-is-live-af396ee7cc0d","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Certification, via our partner Civic, is ready!

Failing to address this can be life-threatening for a protocol, when there are so many alternative projects and activities for a passerby to allocate their attention to. We’ve seen it time and time again: A project may have the best product or tech, but unless it’s easy to grasp or get into, no one will want to devote the energy required to understand it.How then to create the easiest onramp to an outside user? At HOO, the d’app and game side are made to take advantage of preexisting mechanisms and venues that the public already frequents in their day to day. Moreover, crucial concerns on the technical level (bridging, identity, etc) are abstracted at the point of interaction, meaning there are simply less things for a user to think about — this leaves time for them to get into what they’re after in the first place: an exciting, immersive activity blending a basic mix of fun and strategy. This is accomplished in a few ways:As native crypto users, the most commonly frequented apps you will likely see are Telegram, Discord, and of course, Twitter (now X). However, with 800 million users globally and a built in feature to port games (in addition to its own native blockchain), Telegram presents the best opportunity to expose HOO to a vast new audience of users while enabling an easy, mobile-friendly point of interaction. Already hanging with a few friends in a group chat? Why not open the HOO channel, and challenge your buddies to see whose gladiator is best?The same spirit involved in this will be supported through designated mobile store apps as well, and with discord embeds, enabling native venues that have their own users to begin with, to serve as sources of user growth and retention.Another hurdle to overcome is the challenge of technical stress and the litany of things that can and do go wrong within the crypto industry. How does one alleviate the stress normally associated with navigating 85 different chains, bridging solutions, and points of interaction? With HOO, we opted for a web based launcher, eliminating the need for a standalone downloaded client, meaning users can simply connect via a standard wallet, and begin playing, no additional time or equipment required. Finally and most critical to this area, while a user may have liquidity on a number of chains, they need not manually bridge or worry about how to pool funds. With HOO’s native $AMBR being designed as a LayerZero 0ft, despite the contracts for the infrastructure residing on BASE, users will be able to connect and play from any chain they happen to prefer.What’s next? With $AMBR’s TGE just around the corner, and the MVP for gladiatorial combat entering the testnet, there are numerous opportunities to qualify for HOO’s second round of airdrops, and to best situate yourself to take advantage of its growth.Make sure to follow our Twitter and join our Discord to learn about the latest offerings, the (soon to be announced) TGE and trading venue for $AMBR, and all the ongoing updates and developments!","tags":["Gaming","Blockchain","Crypto","Cryptocurrency"],"author":"The Halls of Olympia"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@papajams/decentralized-dispute-resolution-86607ee0dcf","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"From Courtrooms to The Blockchain: DDR at the intersection of decentralization and justice","title":"Decentralized Dispute Resolution","detailed_content":"As an emergent form of organizing and coordinating activities, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are changing the landscape of governance.

The Origin","title":"Defining the DeFi future - Jade98 Platform Mechanics","detailed_content":"Ordinals became a significant game changer in the NFT segment in 2023. Since their introduction on the Bitcoin blockchain, the daily inscriptions have shown a consistent increase. As of now, there have been a total of 66,348,042 inscriptions.Ordinals introduced an innovative approach to creating NFTs, meme tokens, and other digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, it caused lots of discussions within the community. Ordinals utilize inscriptions to store content directly on the blockchain, leading to skepticism among many users about its overall benefit to the ecosystem. Concerns were raised that the block space occupied by these NFTs could potentially increase fees and reduce transaction speeds.Over time, it became clear that Ordinals have become a crucial component of the Bitcoin blockchain, laying the foundation for their integration into decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and yield farming platforms.Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, stated, “Bitcoin-NFT technology has the potential to foster innovation in the digital asset market.” He also mentioned that the creation of applications and further development of the blockchain would accelerate its mass adoption. As observed, the number of application inscriptions grew significantly in 2024.Taking that into account, it was only a matter of time before Ordinals and immersive augmented reality (AR) merged.The Jade98 platform introduces the first-ever AR inscriptions (Jade ARdinals), set to redefine the standards of digital collectibles. It was created to enhance efficiency, transparency, and unique user engagement in the DeFi segment.With the Jade98 platform, you can not only upgrade your existing BRC collections but also craft ARdinal collections right from scratch.Let’s explore the groundbreaking Jade98 platform, which allows its users to create Jade ARdinals and earn rewards for their activity.To understand the whole Jade98 Platform ecosystem, it’s important to learn the main functionality of its basic element.The JD98 token is the cornerstone of the entire ecosystem. It facilitates payments for core functionalities, such as using AR technologies, on the platform. Creators also receive staking rewards in $JD98 tokens.Its primary utility is to support commissions and transactions throughout the platform, serving as its vital lifeblood.At the heart of Jade98 platform lies the concept of epochs — fixed intervals of time 1999998 sec. At the end of each epoch, significant events occur, such as stakers receiving their JD98 rewards or the burning of the revenue treasury.Check out the detailed scheme of the platform below:These are the main tokenomics processes that maintain the functionality and financial payback of the system. Unlike the tokenomics of many other DeFi platforms, all processes on the Jade98 Platform are fully transparent, with no hidden pitfalls.Now, let’s review each of these processes individually.Central to Jade’s platform revenue model is the provision of augmented reality (AR) services. You have the freedom to craft an exciting ARdinal collection from scratch, complete with all metadata. Overall, you get the full package: create your AR, mint it on the blockchain, and showcase your unique digital masterpiece.For these innovative opportunities, users pay a service fee in BTC upon initiating the mint transactions (similar to Luminex/Unisat inscription service).This revenue is collected in the platform’s treasury for subsequent distribution through various mechanisms: rewards pool for stakers, Buyback and Burning mechanism, and other processes that ensure sustained growth and profitability of Jade98 platform.Another important feature of Jade98 platform is the Buyback and Burning mechanism, wherein 20% of incoming revenue is allocated towards purchasing $JD98 tokens from the market.The process is depicted in detail in the upper part of the whole Jade98 platform tokenomics scheme.As you see, the Service Revenue users pay for ARdinals creation is then converted to JD98 for the further Burning and then accumulated in the Burning Treasury to be systematically burned at the end of each epoch. The system sends them a Bitcoin Eater address, thereby enhancing the token value.Stakers on the platform can enjoy multiple avenues for staking, enabling them to extract tokens from circulation and lock them within the platform in exchange for a share of profits generated during the epoch.As you can see from another part of the tokenomics scheme, there are several ways of staking available.In this case, you’ll receive your rewards at the end of the epoch.For the Jade Pair Staking, you’ll need to get an ARdinal from Jade ARdinals Collection. This will increase your rewards by staking a special Jade ARdinal with JD98$.The payment amounts and, accordingly, the APY indicator are affected by:Initially, Simple Staking will be developed and launched using a simplified formula. Over time, it will be enhanced by refining the formula and adding additional assets for boosting.At the end of each epoch, rewards from the previous epoch are calculated and disbursed from the Reward Pool in $JD98 tokens. Thus, new rewards are sent to users every 23 days. Regular revenues enable you to redistribute your income correctly and reinvest a portion for additional earnings.Users have the option to receive payouts directly to their addresses or initiate transactions to claim their rewards, with the latter option to minimize transaction fees.Additionally, accrued rewards incur compound interest if left unclaimed.At Jade98 Platform, we strive to develop the effective and transparent tokenomics system that will not only enhance AR/VR functionality but also contribute to our users’ success and increase their income.The groundbreaking integration of AR services with Ordinals will boost the incorporation of the Bitcoin blockchain into the DeFi sector and its mass adoption worldwide. This represents a perfect new direction for immersive, real-world applications to develop and a powerful means to foster a sustainable digital economy.Follow our X(Twitter) to get more information about upcoming events.Join Telegram chat for discussions.","tags":[],"author":"Jade ARdinals","creation_date":"2024-05-02"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@Blockwise/exploring-blockwise-how-wise-merges-ai-with-blockchain-for-a-brighter-crypto-future-d7a1f0a64f3a","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, a new player, $WISE, is making waves with its forward-thinking approach.

We were planning to discuss cross-chain issues, but as is always the case, the conversation meandered off into different fields, mostly concerning how the programming language you use shapes your view of the world.There is a theory of mind based on language with a name that sounds like it came straight out of Star Trek.The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.Simply put, it proposes that the grammar and vocabulary of the language we think in, and the society that we live in and which spawned that language, profoundly influence the way we interpret the world around us. Together, both frame and limit what we are able to mentally conjecture about.Wittgenstein, arguably the foremost philosopher of the 20th century (that is to say, his friends and colleagues argued that he was the foremost philosopher of the 20th century), put in a few simple albeit somewhat inscrutable words:Nobody truly understands Wittgenstein though, possibly because he thought in an Austrian version of the German language, and then translated his thoughts into English.The thing that springs to the mind of any inquisitive software developer reading about these kinds of things is to wonder, “Does the programming language I choose to program in significantly affect the way I think about the tasks at hand? Am I restricting myself by only writing in C++?”(The answer to both those questions is, “Probably, yes.”)You wouldn’t be the first to have such thoughts. Here’s what Paul Graham said about it, a couple of decades ago:But it’s not just programmers who are affected by this.If you are a test engineer or an auditor, and you are reviewing smart contracts, the problem of programming language dissonance can be especially acute. You may be using one language, say, JavaScript, to write tests for smart contracts written in another language, for example, Solidity.This involves exhausting context switching as you shift your focus from one programming language to another, and tired test engineers are always tempted to cut corners. Worse still, it can restrict your thought patterns and cause you to miss some significant areas of testing.JavaScript and Solidity are syntactically not that different. They are both imperative languages — abstractions of assembly language. And their syntax is very similar; it’s like comparing Spanish to Italian. But there are some notable problems. For example, when passing a value from JavaScript to a Solidity smart contract using Hardhat, you are often going to rely on your framework implicitly converting a JavaScript string to Solidity bytes. The behind-the-scenes conversion can cause bugs to slip through the cracks of your test coverage.The disparity becomes even greater when you are working across two imperative programming languages with a different fundamental raison d’être.For example Rust, which is compiled and requires an understanding of the underlying mechanics of memory allocation and reclamation, versus Python, which is more of a “get things done quickly” interpreted language with automatic garbage collection. In this case, we are looking at the programming equivalent of comparing German to French.At least they’re both Indo-European languages though.Most of the programmers I have worked with code in a predominantly imperative style, with control flow forming the backbone of their code.But there is another significant class of programming languages: purely functional ones, such as Lisp and Haskell. If you are using JavaScript to test a Cardano smart contract in the Haskell-like language Plutus, then you are doing the coding equivalent of switching between German (an Indo-European language) and Finnish (a Finno-Ugric language with a distinctly different set of grammar rules, even if it does use the same alphabet).Michal uses Foundry to write and test Ethereum smart contracts, whereas I am an adherent to the Hardhat toolchain for those activities. That means that he is writing his tests in Solidity, and I am writing in JavaScript. And as we’re both testing Solidity contracts, he doesn’t have to context switch and I do.If you have the time and budget, ideally you’d hire a version of Michal and one of me to check your contract — there will be a lot of duplication, but the overlap of our testing will not be 100%.Part of that is because we’re coding and thinking in different languages.But there is another aspect worth considering.The problem with Solidity is that all the really serious bugs are environment related, not code related. What that means is that they depend as much on the EVM — the way data is stored and executed on Ethereum, as they do on lines of code.This is like looking at a society’s behaviour rather than just its language. To use a cultural analogy: being able to speak Finnish is not going to teach you that you are expected to take your shoes off when entering a house in Finland.The unfortunate conclusion is that to truly test a smart contract thoroughly, you need to fluent not just in the language of the contract, but also in the environment or “culture” that exists around that contract. And this will include a testing framework.It is also why bridges from one chain to another are so vulnerable. There you are moving not just from one language to another, but from one culture to another as well. A general adage in the business of translating books is that your translator should be a native speaker of the language into which the book is being translated, but they need to be fluent in the language it is coming from.In blockchain, that’s really hard. There are very few people who are native in one chain, and fluent in another. To be frank, there are very few people who are fluent in any given chain, let alone native.Bridges should really be written, and then tested, by people who are fully conversant with both chains.As part of the regular process of talking to the Resonance Security engineers, I am getting to exchange ideas with people from different backgrounds, who think in different languages, and write code in different languages too.This week I was talking to Michal, who is Polish, and predominantly uses Rust. Last week I was in conversation with Joao, who is Portuguese, and prefers Python. And next week I’m going to be interviewing Luis, who informs me that he thinks in Spanish. I’ll find out what his favorite programming language is in due course.That’s a lot of languages, and therefore a lot of different perspectives.Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow[4], and the same may well apply to software vulnerabilities and auditing too.But it doesn’t work if all the eyeballs are the same…[1] B.

If you’d like to start from there, you can find that hereWhat is a Validator and What does it do?Running a ValidatorValidator EconomicsRunning a Profitable ValidatorConclusionBefore we get started, a few terms will come up periodically, so let’s get them out of the way:With that out of the way, let’s dive in.A validator is PoS terminology for a node that participates in blockchain consensus.In PoS, voting nodes put up tokens as collateral that can be seized or destroyed should they behave maliciously.Voting nodes are tasked with:Validators are crucial to the network because they effectively decide what is true. The greater the number of validators, the more secure and decentralized the network is. Stake spread is also very important. But all of this is likely not news to you.Let’s move on to why we’re here.Before we move forward, it’s important we make a distinction between validators and RPC nodes on Solana.In an ideal world, everyone who uses the blockchain would run their own node. These nodes would connect to other nodes to propagate the user’s transactions and verify that the blockchain is true.In practice, this doesn’t happen because of how technically and financially demanding it is to run a node. For most people, RPC nodes are how we interact with the blockchain.An RPC node does two things:This article will focus mainly on validators because the economics of operating an RPC node are obscure.dApps (like wallets) either run their own RPC nodes or pay entities like Helius to use RPC nodes. But these arrangements are done off-chain.We can see Helius’ pricing here, but we have almost no idea about the operational costs or demand. So it’s hard to say how much profit (or loss) RPC providers make.Because of this, we’ll focus exclusively on Validators going forward.For those interested in running RPC nodes, the Solana Tech discord linked at the end of this hosts ann RPC node operator channel. You can ask more questions there.A validator operator’s main job (after completing the setup) is to monitor their node and work on improving its performance.There are two primary things a validator needs:Everything else is secondary.Technical expertise is crucial because, as you’ll soon see, running a validator is technically demanding. You need to understand hardware, DevOps, blockchain architecture and backend development if you’re going to be successful.You can run a node without understanding these things, but you’ll struggle with even the most “basic” things.Here’s someone who paid more than double what he should have for hardware but ended up struggling to get his node running because the setup just wasn’t right.You’ll see more examples like this as we move on, have it in the back of your mind that running a node is technically demanding.Aside technical expertise, running a validator can be expensive.Let’s break down the requirements.To run a validator, you need four things: hardware, bandwidth, stake and voting SOLThese are the official recommendations from the Solana Labs documentation:Bandwidth: 1 GBit/s symmetric, commercial. 10 GBit/s preferred.In practice, most validators run slightly more powerful machines but there are no benefits to going overboard.There’s no minimum stake on Solana and the network supports native delegation so validators don’t need to (and usually don’t) own all the SOL they stake.But the more you stake, the more likely you’re selected as leader. The exact amounts you should aim for will be discussed in the economics section.On Solana, votes count as transactions, and a validator is expected to vote on every block. It comes out to around 1 SOL per day but we’ll discuss all the nuance in the economics section.With these four things, anyone can run their own validator.And now to the big question: How profitable is it?As a primer to validator economics, we’ll quickly look at a simple overview of Solana’s tokenomics.Solana’s tokenomics are similar to Ethereum’s; there’s inflation to create new tokens and burning to destroy them. The specifics are a little different.When a block is produced, a certain amount of SOL is created as a block reward.The exact amount depends on the current inflation rate.Inflation started out at 8% and is designed to go down by 15% every epoch-year. It’s adjusted every epoch and will continue to fall until it hits 1.5%, which is the “terminal inflation rate.”The inflation for this epoch is 5.466% (February 20, 2024).If you run the solana inflation command on the Solana CLI, you’ll obtain the current number:This inflation is currently the only mechanism for creating new SOL tokens.Sidebar: Inflation can be confusing because it seems like token holders are getting diluted, but that’s not true. You can think of inflation as the price that non-stakers pay to stakers for securing the network. Stakers don’t get diluted; only non-stakers do. It’s simply the cost of decentralization. And even Ethereum runs a similar system.The current burn mechanism for Solana is very simple: 50% of all fees are burned. SIMD-0096 will stop burning priority fees, but for now, 50% of all fees are burned.The other 50% is sent to the leader for that slot.And that’s it.Now that we’ve broken down Solana’s economics, let’s move on to why we’re here: Validator economics.This will also be divided into two parts: the Costs and the IncomeIf you’re familiar with computer hardware, you probably already have a rough idea of how expensive the recommended hardware is.It’s more expensive in practice because validator nodes have to be active 100% of the time.That means a dedicated power and cooling system, backup and replacement components, and full-time staff monitoring the computer.All of this makes it impractical to run your validator from home.To work around this, most validator operators use bare-metal servers from Tier 3 data centers for their nodes. Prices can vary widely depending on the location, but Latitude currently charges between $373 and $608 per month for a machine that fits the bill.Bandwidth consumption is hard to estimate because it depends on your stake size.If you’re the leader more often, you’ll send out more data than validators who are leader less often. But the average validator usually processes about 60–100 TB of data per month.This is another reason to use a data center. If you wanted this sort of bandwidth at home, you’d likely need a dedicated line from your ISP.Here’s someone who tried to do it from home and is understandably running into issues:In regards to the costs for a data center, it varies by provider and location.Latitude charges between $0.64 and $3.60 USD/TB for egress, depending on the region. Ingress is free.Total costs with a projection of 60–100 TB per month amount to anywhere between $38.4 and $360 per month.On Solana, votes count as transactions.Every validator is expected to vote once per slot.Each vote costs 0.000005 SOL. Per epoch, that’s 2.16 SOL.In a year, that amounts to 394.2 SOL and that’s about 1.08 SOL per day.In practice, this number is slightly lower because slots are not exactly 400 ms but on average, it currently costs about 1 SOL per day to vote.Voting costs are easily the most significant expense of running a validator and there’s no way to get around them.Each correct vote earns the validator a credit. At the end of each epoch, the inflation rewards for the epoch are split among participating nodes based on:So if your node doesn’t vote, it’ll lose out on rewards at the end of the epoch.Incentivizing nodes to vote is important because consensus would grind to a halt otherwise.As to why voting transactions cost actual SOL, Toly says it’s a sort of minimum stake requirement.There’s community consensus that this cost creates a centralization vector and there are proposed changes that will reduce its effect but we’ll discuss those later.Staking tokens takes away a lot of their functionality, and like I mentioned already, maintaining a validator is a full-time job.LSTs, stake pools and protocols like Sanctum are actively working to reduce the impact of the financial opportunity cost. But as an aspiring validator, you should be aware of what you’ll be giving up, especially time.Those are the costs associated with running a Solana validator.Now onto the good stuff:Every validator has two major sources of income and a two (optional) ones depending on what client the validator is running.Solana runs native Delegated-POS so validators usually don’t own all their stake. However, inflation rewards belong to stake owners, which means validators usually don’t own most of the inflation rewards.Commission is the amount a validator charges delegators for its work.It can be any whole number from 0 to 100%.This commission is currently the primary source of income for small validators.Like I mentioned earlier, half of all transaction fees from blocks are burned; the other half belongs to the leader for the slot.Solana’s native block builder (called the scheduler) is partially random. It isn’t First-In, First-Out (FIFO), or even based on priority fees.Priority fees improve the chances of transaction inclusion but they don’t control ordering. In essence, paying the highest priority fee doesn’t mean your transaction will be processed first.Coupled with the naïve and extremely cheap fees, spamming proves more effective at landing transactions on Solana, especially time sensitive transactions like MEV capture.To put into perspective how bad this is, Jito estimates that 58% of blockspace was filled with failed arbitrage transactionsJitoLabs came up with a solution for this. I won’t discuss how it works (you can find that here.)The important thing is running the JITO client will get you bribes for processing certain transactions.Since the JITO bribing arrangement is done off-chain, the bribes don’t count as normal fees, so all the fees from MEV bribes belong to the validator.Those are the sources of income for a validator.A validator could choose to capture MEV for themselves but they’d likely be blacklisted when discovered.So what does all that mean for profitability?The biggest problem with understanding validator economics is the number of variables.If I had to write an equation for profit, it would look like this:In said equation, the only constants are hardware and bandwidth costs and even those vary between providers and locations.The other components are harder to estimate:The point I’m making is that it’s hard to make any definitive projections on profitability so take these numbers with a heap of salt.At current market conditions, a private validator (100% commission) with average performance would need about 5100 SOL staked to break even.If you run the Jito client, you’d need about 5,000 SOL.This, of course, does not account for intangibles like an entire year of your time, the opportunity cost of locking up your tokens, or any change in the variables.For validators with delegated stake, it’s estimated that it would take about 80k SOL delegated at 5% commission for an average validator to break even today.You can use Cogent’s Profit Calculator to play around with different variations to get an idea of how much stake it would take to break even under different conditions. It’s an amazing tool.The key takeaway is if you can raise enough stake, you’ll be profitable.But what does it take to raise stake and by extension run a profitable validator.As you can probably tell by now, running a profitable validator is a difficult and complex task. I think Italo’s words describe it best.Putting setup aside, the big question is: how do you go about raising stake?Aside self-stake, there are four sources of stake on Solana: organic, stake pools, the Solana Foundation delegation program, and the Jito delegation program.Organic stake is getting Solana users to delegate to you directly. It’s very difficult starting out since larger validators have more APY and are more trustworthy, but it’s absolutely necessary for validators at all levels.2. Stake PoolsProtocols like Marinade and Blaze run stake pools. A stake pool collects tokens and uses an algorithm to delegate the tokens in a way that maximizes network decentralization and APY for users. This is how most validators get their start.3. Solana Foundation Delegation Program: The Solana Foundation also helps new validators by delegating some of its tokens to them. You could get over 100,000 SOL delegated to you if your validator meets the requirements. The Solana Foundation also temporarily covers voting costs for qualified validators. The only downside is the amount of time it takes to get into the program and KYC.4. Jito Delegation Program: Jito also runs a similar delegation program. You have to run the JITO client and share your MEV bribes with delegators. Aside that, it’s essentially the same as the Solana Foundation’s program (without the KYC.)These are the four sources of stake on Solana but knowing where to get stake is not enough; you need to know how to maximize your delegation.And it boils down to two things: uptime and decentralization.Uptime is the single most important consideration for a validator. Apart from directly affecting how much you earn (through credits), it also affects how likely you are to attract stake.Uptime affects earnings, and so it affects APY. Poor APY means you’ll struggle to get organic stake. The other sources of stakealso have strict uptime criteria that can disqualify you from getting any delegation.Nothing else matters if your validator’s uptime is below average.The second-most important factor is decentralization.Organic stake isn’t affected by decentralization, but it’s a major metric used by all other sources of stake.You’re not going to get much delegation if you use a data center that already hosts 4 other validators somewhere in the EU. So you need to factor in what data center you’ll be using and its location when you decide to set up your validator.There are subtle nuances for different delegation programs, but if you can optimize these two metrics, you could break even in two or three months without needing any stake from the foundation.So by now, you should have a good idea of how profitable running a validator is (in the short term) and what you can do to maximize it.An important follow-up question is: does it make sense long-term?The answer to that question is once again, hard to say.Long-term sustainability is an even more complex topic because the variables can vary wildly over a long time frame.So instead of trying (and failing) to predict how the price of SOL and blockspace demand will vary, I’ll highlight a few developments that will significantly affect Solana’s economic structure.This information in conjuction with what we’ve already discussed should form the basis of your long-term outlook for running a validator.SIMD-0096 proposes that all of the priority fees be sent to the leader. It’s been approved, and when it’s implemented, validator economics will change significantly.Priority fees made up 92% of all non-vote fees in January.If the entirety of the priority fees are sent to the slot leader, it will increase income and reduce reliance on inflation for validators.In other words, validators will be able to do more with less stake.At the moment, Solana’s transaction structure is naïve.Transactions are charged based on how many signatures they require, as opposed to how much computation they require.This structure causes a lot of problems that are better discussed here. All you need to know is that when the ongoing developments towards improving these are completed, votes will cost significantly less than most other transactions.There is also a push to reserve blockspace for votes.If votes have dedicated blockspace, there is less risk of votes being cannibalized by user transactions, so lesser fees are required and, by extension, lower voting costs.The scheduler is being worked on to increase the efficacy of priority fees.When these changes are effected, MEV capture will become easier, there will be a significant reduction in on-chain spam and priority fees should jump.According to Dune, 26% of ETH is staked. About 39% of this is done through liquid staking.On Solana, 67.3% is staked and only 5.1% (of the 67) is done through liquid staking.There are many possible reasons for this, with DeFi maturity being the most cited.The reason it’s relevant is that as DeFi begins to mature on Solana, there will be a shift from native staking to liquid staking.This is good because two of the three biggest liquid staking protocols (Marinade and SolBlaze) actively prioritize decentralization.In other words, as the ecosystem matures, stake spread should improve and it should reduce the initial friction for beginner validators (provided they have good uptime and decentralization).SIMD-0033 is an approved proposal that will penalize late voting. It was proposed because some validators delayed their votes until after consensus was reached. This allowed them to maximize vote credits because they never voted wrong, but it slowed down consensus.With SIMD-0033, timeliness will affect the number of credits earned.I’m mentioning this for two reasons:The effect of the launch of the Firedancer client is moot.It isn’t going to directly increase the value of blockspace and could even theoretically reduce it. But if it really does 10x Solana’s throughput, it’s worth keeping in mind.Solana currently doesn’t have programmatic slashing.In the event that a node is found to be acting maliciously, validators can decide to slash it, but there’s currently no enshrined mechanism. Once implemented, validator behavior will change to adapt to it. It’s hard to say how it’ll affect validator economics, but it’s important to keep in mind.So what does all this mean for sustainability?Overall, the incentives for validators are getting better and more equitable. Competition is definitely getting stiffer, but there’s no reason why a good validator (high-uptime and decentralized) shouldn’t be able to make profit in the near or far future.Running a Solana validator is expensive and time-consuming. But the network rewards validators that perform well and help improve network decentralization.If you fall into that category, you can quickly gather stake and break even.Even if you don’t, running a Solana validator isn’t a blackhole for money. Done right, you can break even quickly without needing any stake from the foundation. Long-term prospects are also bright and the initial friction can only get lower from here.In a nutshell, running a validator can be a profitable endeavor and isn’t as inaccessible as it may initially seem.I hope this has answered all your questions.Links to the validator Discord, Solana Documentation and other helpful resources for those interested are in the next section.For those interested in running their own nodes:Solana Tech DiscordValidator DocumentationGetting Started as a Validator workshopJitoProposals to improve Solana’s FTMSIMD-033 is briefly discussed hereSVM Execution Economics by TolyMany thanks to Cogent, Ferric, Trent.sol, Montchik, Dan Smith, Ryan Chern, Zantetsu (Shinobi Systems) and especially Italo Casas for all their help in creating this.Is it pretentious to acknowledge Toly?Italo runs the SolDev Validator; profits from the validator are used to fund onboarding new devs to Solana.

ExoGP is a play and earn game. There will be rewards for users to incentivize play, competition, and early gameplay feedback.The Exo is the core game piece for Planet Atmos and will be required to participate in ExoGP. It is both the core identity component of the ecosystem and is also a composable, wearable vehicle. The Genesis Exo NFT collection provides early access to ExoGP gameplay and makes Planet Atmos community members eligible for rewards.Rewards will initially be in the form of non-transferrable points and evolve into on-chain rewards, which ultimately consist of our core token, EQD, and NFTs. Rewards will have seasonality and change over time as we develop a sustainable economy.What are we rewarding users for and what are they being rewarded with?We are rewarding users for their involvement, engagement, and participation within Planet Atmos and ExoGP. The majority of these rewards will be reserved for Exo owners.Exo holders will have the opportunity to earn rewards, firstly in the form of points and later in the EQD token directly. The way rewards are distributed and the quantity of those rewards are subject to change as we continue to refine the balance of the game and pursue a long term sustainable economy.PointsPoints are how we will track users’ engagement prior to the launch of our token, EQD. Points are linked to EQD but the mechanics for any potential conversion or redemption will be shared in subsequent documentation. Points are not tradeable in any way.How to earn pointsExo Owners:Whether or not you own an Exo:Other mechanisms for performance point rewards include teams competing with each other to maximize their share of the team reward pool. Also, pilots competing within teams to gain a larger share of the team’s distribution from the reward pool.Point scoring strategy / alpha:The EQD Token\nEQD, or Emergent Quid is the native currency of Planet Atmos. A formal litepaper is in development and will be released when complete. EQD will be used across the Planet Atmos Ecosystem and will replace the points system for rewarding users once live.Beyond Alpha:As gameplay progresses, the points reward system will be replaced with in-game rewards and EQD, and competitors will be charged entry fees and be eligible to earn fee-based purses. Those purses may also include bonus rewards. Rather than being a simulation game, it is a professional racing circuit where you are entering yourself.This will enable the formation of divisions, leagues, and official teams, ultimately fulfilling the competitive narrative for ExoGP.Additionally, an in-game progression system will enable players to unlock and mint additional gear for their Exo as a direct reward for participating.Beyond ExoGPPlanet Atmos is developing a resource-based economy that enables the creation of gear for their Exo and other items. There will be multiple ways to extract OREs from the planet, and use those OREs to craft items.There are two other game modes besides racing that we have designed around our flight controller for ExoGP. These are ExoBall and ExoArena.Exos are the central individual component for Planet Atmos and are therefore interoperable with these other game modes. However, pilots may find that different loadouts and stat profiles are desirable.The Genesis CollectionMint starts at 1pm PT on May 9 on Magic EdenMore information about the MKIV Genesis Exo can be found here","tags":["Gaming","Gaming News","Blockchain","Web3"],"author":"Planet Atmos"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/slalom-business/web3-series-the-story-of-blockchain-e48f9fc8a9ac","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Why it’s important to understand this growing phenomenon that is starting to upend the business world.","title":"Web3 Series: The Story of Blockchain","detailed_content":"Recently, I sat through a Blockchain 101 presentation from a self-styled expert who promised to make sense of the convoluted topic.","tags":[],"author":"Andrew Quinn","creation_date":"2023-01-10"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/cumulo-pro/how-to-manage-your-assets-of-nim-network-the-first-dymension-rollup-4afd25afc9c6","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"By Cumulo.pro","title":"How to manage your assets of NIM Network, the first Dymension Rollup.","detailed_content":"∘ NIM metrics, supply, TVL and chain-id information\n∘ NIM Explorer\n∘ How to display the NIM token in my wallet\n∘ Another way to display the token.\n∘ How to display the NIM token in my MetaMask wallet\n∘ How to view your NIM balance in Portal\n∘ Send your NIM tokens to the Dymension network.\n∘ Transfer tokens from NIM\n∘ NIM Swap\n∘ How to staking in the NIM network\n∘ NIM PoolThe balance will be reflected in your Keprl wallet.The NIM token should already appear in your wallet, you can check it in the top right corner of your wallet.Your NIM balance will appear on the Nim Network.Dymension uses eIBC to move tokens between its liquidity hub networks.The eIBC transfer may take longer than usual if the network is saturated.When the token transfer is complete, the tokens will appear on the Dymension network and you will be able to see them in your wallet in Portal.A message confirming the transfer will appear.Once we have transferred NIM tokens to the Dymension network we can swap them for another token.Go to Portal.Select the token to swap and the amount, then click on the Swap button.Approve the transaction in your wallet.A message confirming the completed swap operation will be displayed.A message confirming your staking process will appear.And your stake amount will appear in My Delegations.Liquidity pools allow you to perform farming operations in the Pools by accessing the Pools menu:The specified APR is currently based on swap fees + the Pool’s own APR approved in governance, 0.20% of each swap is added to the liquidity pool, which increases your LP position.NOTE: To create a NIM pool you must first transfer it to the Dym network, as indicated in the section: ∘ Send your NIM tokens to the Dymension network.💈Find your NIM pool and add liquidity by clicking on Add liquidity:💈Choose the amounts of the pair to create your new position and sign the liquidity aggregation:💈Once the transaction has been approved, a confirmation message will appear:💈You can already see the pair in My Positions, now you have to activate the Bonded shares to start receiving rewards from the pool, click on Bond to start generating returns:💈In the next panel, indicate the amount of liquidity you wish to stake and click on Bond Liquidity:💈Confirm the transaction in your wallet:💈A message will appear to confirm the operation:💈Click on one of your positions to see more details about it:Pool rewards considerations:💈The rewards from each pool will always be received directly into your wallet in DYM tokens.💈Unlocking a pool to obtain liquidity tokens has an unlocking period of a few minutes.Twitter | Medium | LinkedIn | Discord | Telegram | cumulo.pro","tags":["Nimnetwork","Blockchain","Cumulo","Rollup"],"author":"Cumulo"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/kroma-network/southeast-asia-blockchain-week-2024-recap-eb475b4bc09d","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Kroma Team attended the Southeast Asia Blockchain Week (SEABW) in Bangkok from April 24th to 28th.","title":"Southeast Asia Blockchain Week 2024 Recap","detailed_content":"April was a fruitful month for the Kroma Team!

The market is again experiencing volatile sentiments due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving and confirmed rumors about the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.Old blockchains and coins in the cryptocurrency market have already been well-studied. We all know what BTC and Ethereum (ETH) are capable of and what to expect from their development plans in 2024. We know that in 2023, many new blockchains were launched, including WB Network and BASE.While headlines in 2023 were dominated by Layer 2 Ethereum, zero-knowledge proof, and Bitcoin’s ordinal numbers, what significant stories can we expect to see in 2024?The rapid growth of Solana (SOL) towards the end of 2023, alongside the expansion of the Cosmos (ATOM) ecosystem through chains like Injective Protocol (INJ), suggests that the era of Ethereum dominance may be coming to an end.Despite the success of non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, smart contracts, and decentralized applications based on Ethereum continue to dominate, attracting the highest developer activity and Total Value Locked (TVL) statistics.While non-EVM chains will thrive, platforms that find ways to leverage Ethereum-based architecture will automatically gain good user adoption opportunities.Meanwhile, the gravitational pull of Bitcoin cannot be ignored. With only a few months left until the next halving and the countdown timer affirming the positive impact of approving a spot Bitcoin-ETF, things look promising for the king of digital assets.Bitcoin-Fi is already on the horizon, and tokens like Ordinals and BRC-20 may have just been the beginning. Let’s now turn our attention to blockchain projects that deserve your consideration.In 2023, the focus on security increased, based on the report from SlowMist Technology’s “Annual Report on Blockchain Security and Anti-Money Laundering for 2023.”According to the data, a total of 464 security incidents occurred in 2023, resulting in losses of $2.486 billion. Compared to 2022, losses decreased by 34.2% on an annual basis.The cryptocurrency industry has experienced ups and downs amid a tumultuous “crypto winter” and bear market. Governments and international organizations have adopted a more cautious stance, and cryptocurrency regulation policies in various countries are still gradually taking shape.The attention of cybercriminals towards the crypto industry necessitates a diligent and careful approach to security measures. To minimize threats, users should:The cryptocurrency market is largely driven by speculation and hype. As a result, new and innovative protocols often outperform established platforms that we are already familiar with.At the same time, this excitement and speculation make these new crypto assets much more volatile and high-risk. They may not be suitable for low-risk investment strategies.Let’s explore some of the most interesting and new blockchain projects that we can expect to see in 2024.Monad is a new Layer 1 blockchain that promises to deliver what any other Layer 1 blockchain promises. Like many others, it utilizes a Proof-of-Stake network, claiming greater scalability, security, and decentralization than its Web3 competitors.The main Celestia network, code-named Lemon Mint, was launched on October 31, 2023, successfully raising $55 million from venture capitalists, including Spartan Group, Jump Crypto, Blockchain Capital, and Polychain Capital.Functional compatibility has been one of the significant challenges facing cryptocurrency for many years. Connecting digital assets across chains can sometimes be a nightmare, associated with high fees, slippage costs, and a plethora of exploits and hacks.The Ordinals’ protocol is a system for numbering satoshis, assigning a serial number to each satoshi and tracking them through transactions.In simpler terms, ordinals allow users to make individual satoshis unique by adding additional data to them. This process is known as “inscription.”The last on our list of blockchain projects to watch out for this year is NEON. It joins our list of new and exciting blockchain protocols to watch in 2024. NEON EVM is a unique network aiming to give us the best of both worlds and permanently dispel Layer 1 maximalism.The cryptocurrency landscape is poised for new developments and challenges, fueled by anticipation surrounding the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF, technological advancements, and the evolution of groundbreaking projects.Blockchain projects are increasingly prioritizing security, employing new protection methods, and creating secure spaces for users’ cryptocurrencies.Staying informed about intriguing new blockchain projects in the crypto space is a good way to stay ahead and learn about innovations before they become mainstream, ensuring users navigate the dynamic crypto environment with confidence.\u003eFree Tool: Use our simple crypto profit calculator to calculate your potential profits and returns on your cryptocurrency investments.\u003c\u003c\u003cDisclaimer: This article is meant for educational purposes and should not be taken as investment advice.

It is at once crypto’s biggest selling point, going hand in hand with the principles of decentralization, anonymity, and trustlessness, and its biggest pain point, with excruciating KYCs, easily trackable PII, and an ever-suspicious gaze from the outside world.Unfortunately, this is also a topic that is largely misunderstood and misconceived, with many people viewing crypto “privacy” as simply an excuse to finance terrorists and conduct money laundering. The fact that crypto Twitter prides itself for its “anon culture” and that mainstream media often (intentionally or unintentionally) reinforces these biases doesn’t help a case in dissolving these stereotypes.Because Web3 privacy is such an all-encompassing concept, touching upon everything from ape profile pictures to cryptography and Zero Knowledge Proofs, its useless to talk about it in the aggregate, and make lump-sum judgements on whether it is good or bad. Instead, we must break down the problem into different smaller segments. In this essay, I will first break down and analyze Web3’s “privacy” infrastructure at three distinct levels — network level privacy, protocol level privacy, and user level privacy — before exploring the role that technological solutions such as Zero Knowledge Proofs play in the future of Web3 privacy.The first and oldest conception of privacy is at the network level. Network level privacy is where every transaction of a cryptocurrency on a given blockchain network is guaranteed privacy through underlying consensus mechanisms of the blockchain and network-level design choices. As such, these are also called “privacy coins.”This conception of privacy traces its roots all the way back to the Bitcoin protocol, and its idea of anonymizing “wallet addresses” as 160-bit cryptographic hashes [1]. While Bitcoin itself has fully transparent transactions, where any user can inspect any transaction on its network, Bitcoin’s design principles of decentralization and anonymity have undoubtedly inspired the driving force behind the development of “network level privacy” and privacy-first blockchains.One of the leading projects in establishing network level privacy is Monero, a privacy-first blockchain established in 2014. Unlike Bitcoin, Monero hides both user wallets and transactions behind “Ring Signatures,” in which users within a given “ring” have access to a certain group signature, and use that group signature to sign transactions. Therefore, for any given transaction on the Monero network, you can only tell that it comes from a certain group, but you don’t know which user in that group actually signed the transaction. In essence, this is a form of “privacy in the crowd,” in which users band together into groups in order to provide everyone with privacy. [2]Another project that tackles this same space is ZCash, an early pioneer of a form of Zero Knowledge Proofs called zk-SNARKs which has been recently popularized. The fundamental concept behind Zero Knowledge Proofs is that it is a way of proving something is true without revealing any further information (which could compromise security and privacy) [4].A simple example of a Zero Knowledge Proof is a Gradescope autograder [5]. You need to “prove” that you did your CS homework correctly, but don’t need to tell the autograder any further details about your code implementation. Instead, the autograder checks your “knowledge” through running a bunch of hidden test cases, and your code must match the “expected” output of the Gradescope autograder. Through matching the “expected” output, you can provide a Zero Knowledge Proof that you’ve done your homework without showing your actual code implementation.In the case of ZCash, while transactions are by default transparent, users can choose to use these “Zero Knowledge Proofs” to create private transactions. When a user wants to send a transaction, they create a transaction message that includes the sender’s public address, the recipient’s public address, and the amount of the transaction, and then convert this into a zk-SNARK proof, which is the only thing sent to the network. This zk-SNARK proof contains all the necessary information to prove the validity of the transaction, but doesn’t reveal any of the details of the transaction itself. This means that the network can validate the transaction without knowing who sent it, who received it, or the amount involved.Despite their design and implementation differences, for both Monero and ZCash the transaction privacy is guaranteed at the blockchain level, such that all transactions happening on the network are automatically guaranteed to be private. This privacy guarantee can be easily abused by bad actors to conduct money laundering, terrorist activities, and drug trafficking, and Monero is particularly notorious for its popularity on the Dark Web [6]. Furthermore, as Monero and other “privacy coins” become synonymous with illicit financial activities, this drives away users using these “privacy coins” out of legitimate privacy concerns, feeding a negative feedback loop that only results in a more harmful shadow economy.This is the biggest drawback of guaranteeing privacy at the network level: it is an “all or nothing” approach in design, where there is a zero-sum tradeoff between the transparency of a transaction versus the privacy of this transaction. It is precisely because of this lack of transparency that “network level privacy” draws the most ire from regulators, and the reason why several major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Huobi have delisted Monero, ZCash, and other privacy coins in several jurisdictions [7].A different approach to privacy is to ensure “protocol level privacy,” where instead of hardcoding private transactions into the consensus level of the blockchain network, we process private transactions on a “protocol” or an “application” that runs on top of a blockchain network.Because early blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin, had limited programmability, building “protocol level privacy” was incredibly hard to do, and it was much easier to fork the Bitcoin network and implement privacy from the ground up in the form of a new blockchain and “privacy coin.” But with the advent of Ethereum and the rise of “smart contracts,” this opened a whole new avenue for privacy-preserving protocols.One of the most notable examples of “protocol level privacy” is Tornado Cash, which is a decentralized application (dApp) on Ethereum that “mixes” transactions together into a pool in order to guarantee transaction privacy — conceptually somewhat similar to Monero’s “blend in with the crowd” approach.The Tornado Cash protocol roughly speaking has three main steps:Unfortunately, in August 2022, Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US government, as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) alleged that North Korean hackers were using the protocol to launder stolen funds [10]. As a result of this crackdown, US users, companies, and networks are no longer able to use Tornado Cash. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle went a step further, freezing over $75,000 worth of funds connected to Tornado Cash addresses, and GitHub deleted the accounts of Tornado Cash developers [11].This triggered a controversial storm in the crypto sphere, as many argued that with the vast majority of users using Tornado Cash for legitimate privacy-preserving transactions, and that protocol users should not be punished for the bad actions of a small minority. But importantly, because Tornado Cash is a “protocol level privacy” on Ethereum, rather than a “network level privacy” solution, the crackdown and fallout was restricted only to this one protocol on the Ethereum network rather than affecting the entire network — unlike Monero and ZCash, Ethereum didn’t get delisted from Coinbase because of these sanctions.An alternate approach to “protocol level privacy” pioneered by the Aztec Network focuses on “rollups” to shield user funds and support private transactions. Aztec’s primary product is zk.money, which uses a 2-layer deep recursive Zero Knowledge Proof for both scaling and privacy. The first ZKP proves the correctness of the shielded transaction, ensuring that the transaction was in fact private and there was no informational leak. The second ZKP is used for the rollup itself, in order to bundle the computation of batches of transactions together and ensure that all of these were executed correctly [12].While rollup-based “protocol level privacy” solutions are still in their early stages, they represent the next evolution of “protocol level privacy” solutions. One key advantage of rollup solutions over dApp-based “protocol level privacy” solutions such as Tornado Cash, such as their enhanced scalability, as the heavy-lifting of the computation largely happens off-chain. Furthermore, because much rollup research has been focused solely on increasing computation, there is still ample space for exploration in applying and extending these technologies into the privacy sphere.A third (and most recent) approach to conceptualizing privacy in Web3 is through exploring “user level privacy,” where privacy guarantees are made for an individual user’s data rather than focusing on the data of the user’s transaction. In both the “network” and “protocol” level, we witness the recurring problem of a minority of bad actors (such as Dark Web transactions and money laundering schemes) affecting the use of the network and protocol for the innocent majority that are simply concerned for their personal data privacy.The crucial point of “user level privacy” is that through focusing on individual users of a network itself, we conduct a “targeted” form of filtering where benign users and addresses are free to interact with the blockchain network privately, while bad users can be quickly filtered out. As you can imagine, this is a Herculean task, walking a fine line between transparency and privacy. This user-centric view of privacy also spawns an entire debate (and industry) about the role and future of decentralized identity (dID) adjacent and derived from the question of Web3 privacy [13]. For the sake of brevity, I will not discuss this question of KYC and authentication in Web3.The core insight of “user level privacy” is to separate and reimagine the relationship between the user themselves and their wallet addresses on-chain, as wallet addresses are the atomic identifiers on a blockchain network. Importantly, there is a one-to-many mapping from users to chains: users often control more than one wallet address on each blockchain network they interact with. This is the idea of “on-chain identity fragmentation.” Thus, the crux of “user level privacy” is finding a secure way of mapping users’ personally identifiable information (PII) to all these fragmented on-chain identities.A key project in this regard is Notebook Labs, which seeks to use Zero Knowledge Proofs to link fragmented identities together with a user’s PII [14], while providing the following guarantees:While the cryptographic specifics of the protocol are beyond the scope of this essay, Notebook Labs demonstrates two core principles of “user level privacy” — the importance of addressing reimagining the relationship between the multitude of fragmented on-chain identities with real-world human users, as well as important role that Zero Knowledge Proofs play in aggregating and linking together all of these identities [16].Another emerging solution to the question of “user level privacy” is the idea of “stealth wallets.” Again, the idea of “stealth wallets” capitalizes on the fragmentation of on-chain identities, using the fact that a user typically has more than one identity on-chain. Unlike Tornado Cash and other “protocol level privacy” solutions, which seek to obscure the transaction data itself, stealth addresses seek to obscure who the real people are behind the sender and recipient addresses. This is implemented through essentially finding an algorithm to quickly and automatically generate “one-time wallets” for a user’s transaction [17].One important conceptual difference between “stealth wallets” and previously discussed privacy solutions such as Monero and Tornado Cash is that this is not a form of “privacy in the crowd.” This means that unlike Tornado Cash, which can only make privacy guarantees for mainstream token transfers such as ETH, stealth wallets can also provide security guarantees for niche tokens and NFTs, or unique on-chain assets that have no “crowd” to blend into [17]. Nonetheless, thus far the discussion of “stealth wallets” on Ethereum has remained at the theoretical stage, and the implementation effectiveness and legal repercussions of this novel technological solution are yet to be seen.As we can see, privacy is complicated in Web3. Different approaches to the problem — at the network level, at the protocol level, and at the user level — invite different solutions to it, and explore different tradeoffs between transparency and privacy. That said, any discussion of privacy is incomplete without considering the flip side of the coin: transparency and accountability.For better or for worse, regulators are right in saying that there needs to be a greater accountability in cryptocurrency transactions. Bad actors engaged in money laundering, terrorist activities, and financial fraud should be held accountable, regardless of whether they use fiat or crypto to complete their transactions. But hopefully, in Web3 this accountability can be achieved without governments resorting to shutting off privacy networks altogether and forcing people to use these blockchains “cryptographically naked.” Privacy should be seen as a basic right, and a measure of digital dignity.For a long time, privacy and accountability were seen as a zero-sum game, where you could either hide your data and have privacy, or show your data and have transparency. The innovativeness of Web3 comes in its pioneering of elegant technological solutions, especially Zero Knowledge Proofs, to overcome this zero-sum dilemma. But the burden is on the Web3 community, not regulatory agencies, to show that these technologies can actually work in ensuring both privacy and accountability.Far too often, Zero Knowledge Proofs are touted as the end-all-be-all for any privacy problem. But despite all their mathematical magic, ZKPs are far from being a panacea for all of Web3’s privacy concerns and have several critical drawbacks. Firstly, ZKPs are often highly specialized circuits used to prove a certain piece of information structured in a particular way. In general, they suffer from a lack of scalability and compatibility. Secondly, they are very expensive to create, run, and maintain, requiring orders of magnitude more of computation power than an equivalent non-ZKP program.Thus, when thinking about ZKPs in the realm of privacy, the important question will always be “what” are you going to prove, and “why”? After all, there’s no free lunch, and designing a ZKP always will always come with a cost. It is just as irresponsible for tech evangelists to declare that ZKPs will solve everything in privacy as it is for regulators to shut down all privacy protocols.Fundamentally, privacy in Web3 is not just an engineering question; it’s a first principles one. Ever since the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper and the commercial adoption of the blockchain, one of the foundational principles of Web3 is its emphasis on trustlessness — where you don’t need to trust information to any party that could potentially turn that trust against you. A network can only truly be trustless when its users’ privacy is guaranteed through a decentralized, transparent, and unbiased manner.So what should privacy look like in Web3? That’s the most pressing question for us to decide.🐦 @0xfishylosopher📅 25 February 2023[1] https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy[2] https://decrypt.co/resources/monero[3] https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/[4] https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/[5] The Gradescope example is from one of my previous blog posts, which discusses the principles of ZKPs (and zk-Sync v2.0) in more depth: https://medium.com/web3-insights/zk-sync-v2-0-and-the-future-of-zk-rollups-2d9617d5193b[6] https://dailycoin.com/monero-xmr-darknet-darling/[7] https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252512394/Monero-and-the-complicated-world-of-privacy-coins[8] https://messari.vercel.app/article/on-chain-privacy[9] https://www.coincenter.org/education/advanced-topics/how-does-tornado-cash-work/[10] https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916[11] https://time.com/6205143/tornado-cash-us-crypto-ban/[12] See more: https://zk.money/[13] See more about dID: https://beincrypto.com/learn/decentralized-identity/[14] https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/27/bain-capital-crypto-leads-33m-round-for-privacy-focused-identity-protocol/[15] Notebook Labs Whitepaper: https://assets.website-files.com/635b21dddd46c8cddf2171fd/635b21dddd46c8be9021722c_Notebook_Whitepaper.pdf[16] https://securityboulevard.com/2022/09/y-combinators-summer-2022-cybersecurity-privacy-and-trust-startups/[17] Technical discussion of “stealth wallets” omitted here for simplicity.

This collaboration aims to improve Ritual’s Infernet and blockchain infrastructure, while at the same time opening up new AI-native opportunities for operators on EigenLayer.To run a Ritual Node effectively, we’ll need:To get started with installing your node, you’ll first need to rent a VPS (Virtual Private Server). Using a VPS offers several advantages, such as enhanced performance, scalability and reliability. I’ll guide you through the process of renting a VPS at a lower cost, and show you how to configure it. Follow the steps below to get your VPS ready for the node installation. Research VPS providers: Take some time to explore different VPS providers available in the market. Consider factors like pricing, reputation, and customer reviews to find the right fit for your needs. Look for plans that offer the appropriate amount of resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to support your node. Contabo is my preferred choice due to their combination of affordable pricing, reliable performance, and user-friendly interface.I personally use and trust Contabo for my blockchain nodes. I’ve recently joined their affiliate program to recommend their services. If you decide to use my affiliate links for Contabo, you’ll be supporting my work at no extra cost to you. This support is important for continuing our journey together in the fascinating world of crypto, and using these affiliate links is a direct and impactful way to back my efforts. Thank you very much for your support!Minimum and recommended hardware specifications needed for this node:In setting up the node, we’ll follow the recommended hardware guidelines and choose the Cloud VPS 2 package.I will initially select a rental period of 1 month, with the flexibility to extend it later if needed:Make sure to choose the option “European Union (Germany)”:For the best storage solution, I recommend selecting the 400GB SSD storage type.To access Docker with Ubuntu 22.04, navigate to the “Apps \u0026 Panels” section and make the appropriate selection:To prioritize security, I highly recommend to generate a password and securely store it to ensure maximum protection:For the final step, it’s recommended to leave the sections titled “Object Storage”, “Networking”, and “Add-Ons” in their default state without any modifications. If you are new to Contabo, please create an account; otherwise, login using your existing credentials. Provide your personal data by filling in the required fields. Complete the remaining fields with your personal information, and click the “Next” button to proceed with the payment. After successfully completing the payment for your order, you will receive an initial email. Within approximately 15 minutes, you will receive a second email containing all the information needed to connect to your VPS.Download and install most recent edition of PuTTY by visiting the official website:You will find the IP adress of your VPS in the second email. Launch PuTTY, enter the IP address of your VPS and click “Open”:Once the server interface is open, you will be prompted to provide login details; simply enter “root” as the user and use your chosen password:Congratulations! You are now successfully logged into your server:To continue, we can update the packages by running the following commands in the terminal. The first part of the command (sudo apt update) updates the package lists for upgrades, and the second part (sudo apt upgrade -y) actually performs the upgrades with the “-y” flag allowing for automatic confirmation of prompts during the upgrade process:In this step, we’re preparing the system by installing essential build tools. Specifically, curl and git are used for downloading and managing code repositories, jq for processing JSON data, lz4 for compression and decompression, and build-essential for compiling software from source.Let’s now install Docker, this process will take a few minutes:Once the installation is complete, verify the version using the following command. The Docker version should be a minimum of 24.0.5.Next, let’s proceed with the installation of Docker Compose. Make sure to verify their GitHub repository for the most recent release and adjust the version and accordingly in this command:Use chmod to change the permissions of the Docker Compose directory:Verify the Docker Compose version; it should be at least v2.24.5:To set up and test the Web3 workflow with the Infernet Node, we’ll go through several steps including deploying a node with Infernet SDK contracts and deploying a simple consumer contract for our Web3 demo. After establishing this infrastructure, we’ll make a subscription request through our consumer contract to create an on-chain subscription. This process allows us to monitor the entire lifecycle of the subscription, from the node receiving the subscription event to processing it and finally sending the result back to the consumer contract on-chain. We begin by cloning the starter repository to our local machine and navigating to it, which is the foundation for deploying and testing the components:To ensure your Docker container continues running even if your VPS connection is lost, start a new screen session named “ritual” (or any name you prefer) using this command:Inside this screen session, you set up the hello-world project and all necessary services. We’ll use a single command that initiates the deployment process:We can now exit the session with CTRL + A + D, to detach from screen without disturbing it. To re-enter your session, you can use the screen -ls command to list all the detached (running) screens along with their respective screen IDs. The result will look like this:To connect or attach to a specific running screen, you can use the following command: screen -x [screen id], replacing [screen id] with the screen ID obtained from the output of the previous command, like this:It’s important to be familiar with these screen commands to avoid accidentally starting multiple screen sessions running the same tasks:After executing the deployment command and detaching from the screen session, we’ll verify the operation by opening a second terminal window to list all active Docker containers. This step requires establishing a new SSH connection to your VPS, which is basically the same process as in Step 2, ensuring you can monitor and manage the deployment process effectively:The output should look like this:To update your config.json file, open it in your second terminal window using the nano editor with this command:Please update the following in your configuration file:Your configuration file should look like this:After editing, save and close the file. If you’re using nano, you can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y to confirm the changes, and Enter to exitTo obtain your private key, it’s important to follow a secure process. The official MetaMask documentation provides a detailed guide on how to safely access your private key within the MetaMask wallet.In the final step, we need to adjust the following settings before we can initialize the new configuration.2. Update the Deployment Script: Go to the deployment script located at projects/hello-world/contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol. Use the following command to open the script for editing:These changes will ensure your project’s settings are updated with the correct network and wallet details.To apply your new configuration, including the updated wallet, restart the Docker container one by one in your second terminal session using these commands:Then, verify the restart by listing all running Docker containers using docker ps. Finally, to ensure your changes are active, use this command:Make sure to replace \u003cCONTAINER ID\u003e with the actual ID of the \"deploy-node-1\" container obtained from the docker ps command, like this:Once you restart the “deploy-node-1” container, the logs should now display your your wallet details.Inside the second terminal window we just started, we will now install Foundry which is a portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust, using these commands:Next, it’s important to install the necessary dependencies to ensure smooth integration and deployment. This process involves navigating into the contract’s directory and installing required libraries and SDKs, using these commands:Monitoring the Anvil node’s logs during this process is beneficial to understand the deployment’s progress. For this, open a third terminal window and use the following command:Now, we’ll finally deploy a consumer contract designed to interact with the Infernet SDK. The example provided by the Ritual Team, a “SaysGM” contract, is straightforward: it requests a compute output from an Infernet Node and prints the result using the forge console. To deploy this contract, go back to your second terminal session and execute these commands:In the last step, you should switch to your third terminal window again where you’re monitoring the Anvil node. Look for a new transaction in the logs. If everything is set up correctly, you will notice a transaction indicating that your deployment and interactions with the blockchain are successful.Next, initiate a request to the Infernet Node by executing the following command in your second terminal session (\u003d in the same session where you also deployed the SaysGM contract):This action will trigger an initiation transaction directed at the SaysGm contract, indicating the start of your contract interaction. Now, switch back to your third terminal window where you’re monitoring the Anvil node and look for a new message confirming the transaction, which signifies that your contract interaction has successfully initiated:Shortly after, you should see another transaction from the Infernet Node. This transaction represents the outcome of your on-chain subscription and its corresponding job request, completing the cycle of interaction with the blockchain and demonstrating the node’s processing capabilities.To register and activate your node on the Coordinator contract (0x8d871ef2826ac9001fb2e33fdd6379b6aabf449c) via Basescan, first, make sure you’re using the same Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) connected to your config.json file. For registration, input your wallet’s public address into the “node (address)” field of the “registerNode” function and confirm the transaction. After waiting for 1 hour, proceed to activate your node using the “activateNode” function. This process is important for integrating your node with the network.If the process is successful, you should be able to verify two transactions linked to your wallet on the Basescan explorer: one confirming the registration of your node and the other its activation.To ensure there are no errors across all Docker containers, you can check their logs with the following command. This step is important for identifying and resolving any potential issues that might be affecting your setup:Congratulations!

If you are interested in enabling a chain abstraction experience for your users, we are now onboarding a limited number of wallets and applications!With the surge in the number of rollups and chains, users need chain abstraction more than ever. In our previous blog post, we discussed the essence of chain abstraction and why current attempts at chain abstraction are incapable of meeting user needs. Orby is our answer to Chain Abstraction.Orby is a single integration that allows every wallet and application to enable chain abstraction. Upon integration, users can simply pull out their wallets, connect to applications anywhere, and seamlessly use all their assets everywhere to interact anywhere onchain. Users no longer need to understand the intricacies of different chains, tokens, and virtual machines. Nor learn new tools, onboard to new systems, or actively migrate assets to various chains.The below demo shows a chain-abstracted experience using an Orby-powered fork of Rainbow Wallet on Uniswap: A user who has 20 USDC on Ethereum, 6 USDC on Optimism, and 4 USDC on Arbitrum can now connect their wallet to Uniswap and swap for $30 worth of WETH on Base in one click.Orby is designed to maximize compatibility with the existing system and minimize the need for drastic changes to existing user behavior. Orby does not require the use of a new chain, account system, or token standard. It is just a simple integration that removes complexity from an already complicated system. Developers who want to enable chain abstraction can access Orby through the OrbyEngine or the OrbyKit.OrbyEngine is a Smart RPC endpoint that connects to all chains, unifies accounts, and formulates intents to fill in the gaps for user wants. In other words, users make requests, and OrbyEngine figures out how to make them succeed. This process of filling in gaps and figuring things out encompasses many things, including but not limited to:OrbyEngine supports all account types (i.e., External-Owned Accounts, Smart Contract Accounts), and account set-ups (i.e., embedded accounts, MPC wallets, etc.). Unlike other attempts at chain abstraction, it does not require an overhaul of the entire blockchain stack. It also does not require users to move to a new account system or migrate their assets, thereby minimizing the barrier to adoption. All it takes to integrate the OrbyEngine is to swap out your RPC endpoint and change a few RPC calls. For most developers, this is no more than a day’s worth of work.OrbyKit is a Chain Abstraction SDK designed to channel the powers of Orby to applications. It is a frontend integration that allows applications to provide a native chain-abstracted experience to their users, regardless of their wallet.OrbyKit:We are onboarding a limited number of wallets and applications to be the first to offer chain abstraction to their users.

We’re thrilled to be able to offer our community a chance to claim their share of this massive AI infrastructure play (with lucrative token rewards attached)!So what exactly does purchasing a Rivalz node license actually get you? And how can you best monetize it to your advantage?Today we’ll be breaking down the answers to those questions into the simplest possible terms, as well as giving you the lowdown on all the innovative tech that Rivalz are building.We’ll start with…Let’s cover the most important question first: what exactly are you buying when you participate in a node sale? Well, here’s the simplest answer possible: a node license is an NFT which allows you to generate passive income.If we want to get a little more complex: a node license is an NFT which gives you the right to run a node on the Rivalz blockchain. Rivalz validator nodes (zNodes) are the building blocks of the network, which control the authentication and flow of data throughout the ecosystem. As a reward for this service to the network, zNode operators get paid out fees in the form of $RIZ tokens.A full 20% of the total supply is set aside to be distributed to zNode operators across the first 2.5 years after TGE. That means that — following the mainnet launch in Q3 2024 — each zNode will generate passive income for a full 30 months. Further rewards will be paid out after this first rewards pool is exhausted.To sweeten the deal even further, a further 2% of $RIZ supply will be airdropped to node sale participants directly at TGE, with 100% unlock!Although the language surrounding nodes might at times sound complicated, actually running a node doesn’t have to be complex. You can simply delegate your node to a third-party node operator service, who will run it for you (for a portion of the fees). Rivalz is partnering with multiple of these service providers to support one-click deployment.Closer to the launch of the mainnet in Q3, we will provide a simple guide on how to go about setting up your node through these service providers (along with a guide on how to run the nodes directly on your own hardware, if you’d prefer to do so).To recap:Now let’s take a deeper look at the nuts and bolts of what Rivalz are actually building: a network for the storage and interchange of data for AI systems. To understand the significance of this mission, we should address the problem they’ve set out to solve.When AI developers build applications, they need access to large datasets in order to generate reliable results. As things stand, the sources of this data are often fragmented, incomplete, or even unethically sourced.Rivalz aims to use the power of decentralized computing to intelligently collate, clean, and index this data into a brand new type of reliable and transparent source: a decentralized, cross-chain hub where AI applications can tap into vast and dependable data resources. This is why they call themselves the ‘first AI intel layer’ in Web3.This streamlined AI infrastructure can then be used to power myriad kinds of AI-powered applications: AI agents, trading bots, GameFi projects, DeFi protocols — essentially any project which seeks to implement AI in its tech stands to benefit from integration with the Rivalz data infrastructure.The Rivalz network is made up of two main layers. The first is the Rivalz RollApp — this is essentially an EVM compatible blockchain, built for plug-and-play access to the Rivalz data infrastructure. Here developers can build and integrate their AI-powered DApps, and connect them cross-chain through the power of EVM interoperability.The second layer is the Rivalz DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure network). Simply put, this is the decentralized network made up of every device around the world running a Rivalz node. It’s here that the data inputted into the network is validated, streamlined, cataloged, stored, and managed.Rivalz nodes are responsible for all of the above processes, as well as controlling the inflow and outflow of information between the DePIN layer and apps built on the RollApp. This is what you’ll be contributing to when you buy and run a node through Samurai Starter!On the Rivalz DePIN storage layer, zNodes (validator nodes) handle the authentication and secure processing of data flowing in and out of the storage layer. These are the backbone of the whole decentralized infrastructure, and receive a high rate of $RIZ reward emissions as a result — as we mentioned before, 20% of total supply paid out over 30 months, with 2% of the supply airdropped at TGE.That’s why node licenses are required to run a zNode, and why demand for them is so strong. These licenses are non-transferrable for the first year, after which they can be freely traded (although with the rewards on offer, we’re not sure why you’d want to!).Besides those, the Rivalz network also features rNodes (worker nodes) which provide the actual data storage space for the network. These don’t require a node license to run, but pay out a much lower level of rewards as a result.The programmability and inter-chain compatibility of the Rivalz RollApp means that developers will be able to build their tech directly on top of the protocol in order to access its AI data infrastructure. To showcase the power and potential of this system, Rivalz are also developing their own pair of flagship applications which harness the power of their DePIN system.The first is Agentz: a ‘cross-chain infrastructure AI agent hub’ which enables intelligent programs such as AI trading bots to access the datasets of the Rivalz DePIN storage layer, and operate cross-chain through integration with the Axelar Network.The second is Clonez: the platform where users can ‘license themselves to the world of AI’ by consensually submitting personal data through the platform (including even their voice or likeness), to be indexed on the Rivalz DePIN. AI firms will then be able to license this data from a central marketplace, with users receiving payouts whenever their information is used.In future, each of these flagship Rivalz DApps will get its own deep dive. For now, suffice to say we’re excited about the possibilities that their platform opens up for the next wave of innovative AI-powered applications!The $RIZ token is the native utility token of the Rivalz network. It will be used for transaction fees on the network, paying out rewards to node operators, and be integrated with DApps building on top of the Rivalz RollApp.The token will go live with the launch of the mainnet in Q3 2024, at which point every node license holder will receive a share of 2% of the total $RIZ supply airdropped to their wallets. This airdrop will be 100% unlocked from day one!Rewards for node operators will also be paid out using the token, in the form of $sRIZ (staked RIZ). When claiming their rewards, operators will be able to choose a vesting schedule of 60, 90, or 120 days for their tokens — with greater payouts for longer vesting.Aside from the $RIZ token, zNode operators will also enjoy airdrops from partner projects which build on top of the Rivalz network in future, meaning potential exposure to a wide range of innovative AI projects in the months and years to come.Now that you understand why Rivalz is such a strong AI infrastructure play, let’s dive into the details on how to get involved…Node sales are structured a little differently to standard IDOs, with multiple different price tiers offered. This pricing structure means that those who get in early enjoy the best prices, while latecomers are forced to FOMO in at a much higher cost.The total supply of Rivalz node licenses is 68,000. These are split across 20 tiers, each with a different price. However, regardless of price, all node licenses are exactly the same. You can see the breakdown of the price tiers for the entire campaign here:We at Samurai Starter have been able to secure 400 node licenses for our community at great prices: 200 at Tier 3 and 200 at Tier 4. On top of that, we’ve even managed to secure a 10% discount on the listed prices!This means that we’ll be offering 200 nodes at $536 and a further 200 nodes at $616 — some of the best prices possible.These two different price points mean that those who participate fastest will enjoy the best prices. Read on to make sure you don’t miss out…We’ll be splitting the sale into two rounds. These will be similar to the ‘guaranteed’ and ‘FCFS’ rounds from previous sales.For details on the total number of nodes each person can buy in each round, check this quick reference chart:Both price tiers of zNode will be available to buy from the start of Round 1 on a FCFS basis. On the launchpad page, you’ll be able to select the number of nodes you wish to purchase at each price point, and the system will automatically calculate how much USDC to charge.Those who participate the fastest will be able to secure their nodes at the cheaper price point. Once those cheaper nodes are sold out, their input box will be greyed out.You’ll be able to participate in this sale much like any other raise on Samurai Starter:It’s that simple. However, remember that you’ll need to be quick on the trigger: the first 50% of participants will enjoy a cheaper price!And that’s really all there is to it .

But you can only initiate a send by authenticating (or signing) the private key, which you alone posses.This top level of wallet ownership is also known as an Externally Owned Account (EOA).One common form of AA gives the user the option to save their private key in the cloud and authenticate it with a username and password.Some may quibble over whether this even qualifies as AA. I would argue that it does in the sense that it removes the need to write down and secure a seedphrase and gives the user a familiar pattern with which to authenticate and recover their private key.A much more sophisticated approach I’m seeing more and more is to leverage a technology called Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS).Using this method, the private key is broken up into multiple “key shares,” a certain threshold of which (usually two of three) must be authenticated to reconstitute the whole private key.These wallets represent a few different form factors and common wallet categories.Argent is a mobile app wallet available on iOS and Android, primarily for saving and long term storage of crypto assets.The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Wallet is a browser extension that facilitates access to the Binance Smart Chain and the dapps in that ecosystem.Sequence is a web wallet that supports multiple chains and is purpose built for gaming.With Argent, you have two options for private key management:Option 1— Save your private key to your iCloud key chain and authenticate with biometrics or PIN.This is very convenient, but if you decide to go this route your private key is stored with Apple and is vulnerable to all the same security weaknesses as your iCloud account.Because of this, iCloud has become a much bigger target for hackers. This guy lost $650,000 in a pretty crude fishing attack because he saved his private key to iCloud.Your privacy is also compromised, in the sense that all the personally identifying information associated with your iCloud account is now associated with your private key. If you use biometrics, you might as well have a DNA sample attached to your private key.Your iCloud and biometrics can also be compelled, just like your blood can be compelled if you are pulled over for a DUI.Raw numbers on the other hand (which is what a private key is) and a combination of words (mnemonic seedphrase) cannot be compelled, and they contain no personal identifying information.Option 2— Use SSS to break your private key into three or more key shares and save them amongst several guardians.You can use any or all of these entities as guardians:This is perhaps the least bad implementation I’ve seen of v2 account abstraction.Setup takes significantly more effort than iCloud, but you can configure it in a way that is both private and trustless, so long as you use anonymous guardians (like hardware wallets) and you don’t use Argent’s guardian.You can assign as many guardians as you like and define your own threshold, like two of three, three of five or six of ten.I would say the main drawback of using Argent in this way is that unfortunately, the wallet you create isn’t compatible with any other non custodial wallets that use normal wallet standards.Meaning that if you were to store your savings on Argent, go into a coma for 30 years, then come back and try to restore your wallet, you better hope that Argent didn’t run out of VC money and go under, and that the guardian configuration still works exactly the way it did when you created your account.Otherwise you’re SOL. There is no other wallet that facilitates the authentication of key shares and reconstitutes the private key exactly like Argent.Funny enough, Argent also lets you export your seedphrase from settings. If you do that, the seedphrase would be compatible with other BIP-39 standard wallets, but anyone who has the seedphrase can completely bypass the guardians you set up using SSS.The Argent team has empowered users by giving them a ton of options to roll their own custody setup, which I can appreciate.It’s up to individuals to identify the tradeoffs and decide what is the best solution for them.Similar to Argent, Binance Smart Chain Wallet (BSC) gives users the option to save their private key to Google Cloud, or to secure it via SSS.Guardians are called “authentication factors” and they work the same way as on Argent, except the user doesn’t get to chose where the key shares are stored:Like Argent, it uses the familiar pattern of username and password to save the private key to Google or a key share to Binance.But the tradeoffs are huge:Connecting with google gives the provider (in this case Binance) access to the personal identifying information associated to that google account.This is a non-starter for me and probably many crypto users.BSC’s implementation of SSS is unique to the BSC Wallet, so a wallet created in this fashion is not going to be compatible with any other.Lastly, the third key share must be saved with BSC, so one more major dependency on Binance.Sequence’s approach to onboarding is to completely obscure the existence of the private key from the user.At the outset, you have a number of web2 oAuth options for login, which first made me think they were saving the private key to the cloud.It wasn’t until I read the Terms that I realized they were using SSS:“There are three private keys associated with your Wallet, and two private keys are required to access your Wallet at any given time. One private key is stored locally on your device. Another private key is generated using the Login Credentials you provided to open your Account (“Account”). The third private key is maintained by Horizon. When you log in to your Account/Wallet with your Login Credentials, you access the account using the private key stored on your device and the private key generated in connection with your Login Credentials.”This is strait-up shady.For the tiny fraction of users who read the terms, they still won’t know where their second key share is being stored. It says it is generated using login credentials, but doesn’t say where it is stored. So there is no way to know who that third party is.Unsuspecting users might think that if they lose their device, they can simply sign in using their Facebook or Google credentials, not knowing that one of the key shares was on the lost device.Burying these details in the terms and offering zero education during onboarding might seem like a UX win, but the price is that the user essentially knows nothing about their recovery options.Of course when crypto folks talk about AA, almost no one is referring to v1 or v2. They are talking about the mostly theoretical future promise of v3.To understand v3, we need to go one level down the hierarchy of the EOA and there you find the contract account (CA), or the smart contract layer.Think of the CA as an application that lives on the Ethereum network. The CA is programmable and can do all kinds of interesting things, but the one thing it can’t do is initiate transactions.At least not yet.The future vision of account abstraction, described by Vitalik in a blog post is to merge the EOA and the CA, allowing for transactions to be initiated by the contract account.“Instead of [smart contract code] just being used to implement the logic of applications, it would also be used to implement the verification logic (nonces, signatures…) of individual users’ wallets.” — Vitalik ButerinThis capability theoretically unlocks a whole new world of features, including but by not limited to:Layer 2s are currently leading the charge on this, with zkSync recently deploying a set of tools that facilitate a limited set of AA functionality.Ethereum mainnet doesn’t seem to be too far behind, with an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that integrates AA (EIP-4337) getting a lot of attention from developers and the greater Ethereum community.That being said, the current capabilities of zkSync come with a lot of complexity and overhead, as well as the inherent risks of using any Ethereum Layer 2 chain, which were recently logged by CoinDesk.Layer 2s remain cumbersome from the UX perspective, as most crypto assets are not on a layer 2 by default.Whether you’ve purchased crypto from an exchange or from one of the popular fiat onramps, like Moonpay or Wyre those assets originate on Ethereum mainnet and must first be bridged in order to enjoy any of the benefits of layer 2.Neither EIP-4337 or the much lauded EIP-4844 do anything to address this issue.The first two versions of account abstraction were valiant attempts to address the seedphrase pain point, but when it comes to long term storage of assets these custody models are too fragile for me.Yes, a better solution for the masses will probably emerge at some point, but v1 and v2 basically amount to quasi centralized custody with no backup at all.The reliance on one or more third parties invalidates a key value prop of crypto: No intermediaries.As a practical matter, you have no way of knowing whether a given third party will still be around in a decade or two to help you or your heirs recover your private key.The convenience of having a username and password simply isn’t worth these tradeoffs, imo.As for v3, the progress that has been made is indeed impressive. This next evolution of AA technology is definitely worth keeping a close eye on.However, I think it would be premature to put too much stock in it and I personally will remain skeptical of any project that cites AA as a major differentiator or strategic advantage in the near term.—\nThanks for reading until the end.

It is commonly used in distributed systems, such as distributed databases and file systems, to ensure data consistency and availability.Some real-life applications of the Raft Algorithm include etcd, CockroachDB, and TiDB.First, let\u0027s set up a new TypeScript project using Yarn. In your terminal, run the following commands:This will create a new package.json file, install the TypeScript compiler as a development dependency, and create a tsconfig.json file for your project.Before we start implementing the Raft Algorithm, let\u0027s define some types and enums to represent the different components of the algorithm.These types and enums will represent the different components of the Raft Algorithm, such as terms, logs, and nodes.First, let\u0027s implement the requestVote function that candidates use to request votes from followers. Here’s what that looks like:This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an RequestVoteRPC object as input and returns an RequestVoteResponse object. It checks the RPC term, the voter\u0027s current term, and the voter\u0027s log to determine whether to grant a vote to the candidate.Next, let the appendEntries leaders use the function to replicate log entries and manage the commit index.This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an AppendEntriesRPC object as input and returns an AppendEntriesResponse object. It checks the RPC term, the previous log index, and term, and the node\u0027s log to determine whether to append the new entries to the log.Finally, let’s implement the startElection function, which followers use to start a new election when they have not received any communication from a leader.This function takes a NodeConfiguration object as input and increments the current term, sets the node\u0027s state to a candidate, and sends RequestVoteRPCs to other nodes in the cluster.Now that we have implemented the main functions of the Raft Algorithm, let’s add some more functions to complete the implementation.First, let’s add the handleRequestVoteRPC function, which is called when a node receives a RequestVoteRPC.Next, let’s add the handleAppendEntriesRPC function, which is called when a node receives an AppendEntriesRPC.This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an AppendEntriesRPC object as input and returns an AppendEntriesResponse object. It first checks the RPC term and the node’s state and then either returns a response with success set to false or calls the appendEntries function to determine the result.Finally, let’s add the advanceCommitIndex function, which is called when a leader node receives a successful AppendEntriesResponse from a majority of followers.This function takes an NodeConfiguration object and an array of AppendEntriesResponse objects as input and updates the node\u0027s commit index. It sorts the responses by term and index and then finds the highest index included in most responses.To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript, add the following script to the scripts field in the package.json file:To compile the code, run the following command:You can also use the --watch Flag to automatically recompile the code when any changes are made:To use the functions we implemented in the previous sections, import them into your code and pass in the necessary arguments. For example:To test the functions we implemented in this project, we will use the jest testing framework.First, install jest as a dev dependency:Next, create a tests directory in the root of the project and create a nodeConfiguration.test.ts file inside it.In the nodeConfiguration.test.ts file, import the NodeConfiguration class and write a test to ensure that a new NodeConfiguration object is created with the correct default values:To run the tests, add the following script to the scripts field in the package.json file:Then, run the tests by executing the following command:This will run all the tests in the tests directory and display the results.Next, write tests for the requestVote and handleRequestVoteRPC functions. To do this, create a new file called requestVote.test.ts in the tests directory and add the following tests:There are many more unit tests to add following the same pattern.In conclusion, the Raft algorithm is a powerful tool for achieving consensus in a distributed system. By following the Raft protocol, nodes in the system can agree on a consistent set of commands, even in the face of failures and network partitions.This article has provided a hands-on implementation of the Raft algorithm in TypeScript. While this implementation is just one example of how the Raft algorithm can be implemented, it serves as a useful reference for understanding the concepts behind the algorithm and how they can be applied in practice.We have also included detailed technical explanations and real-life application references throughout the article to understand better the Raft algorithm and its importance in distributed systems.Overall, the Raft algorithm is a key component of any distributed system, and we hope this article has provided a useful resource for understanding its implementation and application.","tags":[],"author":"Radovan Stevanovic","creation_date":"2023-01-10"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@bitpushnews/eigen-airdrop-the-evolution-of-ethereum-e39bb646ac18","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"EigenLayer recently made headlines with its plans for the EIGEN token — the most talked-about airdrop of 2024. However, this highly…","title":"EIGEN Airdrop: The Evolution of Ethereum","detailed_content":"EigenLayer recently made headlines with its plans for the EIGEN token — the most talked-about airdrop of 2024. However, this highly anticipated event was not without its share of controversy. The airdrop, which was supposed to be a straightforward distribution of tokens, was marred with issues such as confusing schedules, non-transferability, and a multi-phase approach. In this analysis, we delve into the complexities of EIGEN, from its airdrop to its utility, and explore the potential implications for the cryptocurrency market.EigenLayer, a restaking protocol, empowers users to re-stake their staked ETH, thereby providing cryptoeconomic security for a diverse range of protocols. This innovative concept transforms ETH into a versatile asset capable of securing entities beyond the Ethereum mainnet, such as oracles, zero-knowledge provers, and Layer 2s. Since its mainnet launch last year, EigenLayer has emerged as the second-largest DeFi protocol, trailing only liquid staking provider Lido, with a staggering total value locked of over $15 billion, or 5 million ETH. This remarkable achievement is largely attributed to their incentivization system, which has rewarded users with points expected to eventually convert into an EigenLayer token.On April 29th, the Eigen Foundation announced the EIGEN token in arguably the most anticipated Ethereum event of the year. Despite the initial excitement about its release and its potential to be valued at over $50 billion and instantly become a top token, the community swiftly turned critical of the tokenomics and the airdrop’s structure. The airdrop will be divided into three seasons of points farming, each with 5% of the total overall supply. The first season will be split into two phases, with phase 1 (90% of tokens) primarily allocated to native restakers and phase 2 (10% of tokens) to complex DeFi users. The second phase will not be released for another month, and the EIGEN token will not be transferable until further notice. These factors and stringent geo-blocking measures that barred access to the claims page for numerous countries and VPNs sparked outrage on Crypto Twitter.Some of this frustration was quelled through further updates, which stated that DeFi users are getting a fair share of the distribution and were not capped at 10% of the supply. Additionally, since this represents the majority of retail depositors, the early whales in Phase 1 will not be able to sell tokens because of their non-transferability. Two issues that have not been resolved are that 55% of tokens go to VCs whose vesting period starts while the token is non-transferable and that it could legitimately be six months to a year until the token is exchangeable. Their stated reason for enacting this limitation is to ensure proper decentralization of the protocol, which we will explore shortly.The EIGEN whitepaper is 43 pages long and provides a detailed explanation of the value and utility of the token. EIGEN will be a work token, meaning that it is rewarded to operators of the network of actively validated services (AVSs) and protocols using EigenLayer’s restaked ETH to secure their protocols. Many other tokens can be classified as work tokens, like ETH or DePIN tokens like Helium’s HNT rewarded to hotspot runners. However, these tokens have two main limitations: first, they are special-purpose and can only be used on a specific application. Second, they can incentivize honest behavior through objective, on-chain attributes like whether or not an ETH validator voted for two separate blocks in the same slot. EIGEN tackles the first problem by allowing for restaking and handles the second through its dual-token approach to truth-seeking. ETH is used as collateral for the system’s objective security concerns and cryptoeconomic security. The EIGEN token will act as collateral for intersubjective security — that which could not be decided by a distinct rule or piece of code but could reasonably be agreed upon by two humans.To keep the token from going chaotic in the case of potential disagreements about a vote, it has a built-in forking process that keeps the token simple for holders while still providing ultimate flexibility. bEIGEN is the staked version of EIGEN, which can be forked during intersubjective forks. EIGEN is simply a wrapper for this token and will follow the fork of social consensus. The intersubjective process allows someone to put down collateral and state that someone else is acting maliciously. Then, EIGEN holders vote, and if proven correct, that user gets rewarded, the malicious actor gets slashed, and the token forks to a new version that goes to everyone except the malicious entity. Even when the majority is dishonest, the minority token will still exist for people to build on and eventually decide to use as the canonical instance. Given the important role of EIGEN in this process, it can be understood why a tradable token on launch would be messy for the early days of the protocol. Still, this does not excuse the lack of transparency around the unlock process or how VCs get to vest during this period.EIGEN’s token model is unlike anything we’ve seen before and unlocks infinite new opportunities for onchain protocols and applications that could previously not be governed. Though the concept is complex, it is abstracted away for EIGEN holders and requires no active maintenance of the token — the perfect mix of utility and simplicity. Even though the airdrop was initially controversial, and the non-transferability of the token hardly makes this a real airdrop until it’s exchangeable, EIGEN seems to be the next great evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem.By Lincoln MurrFollow Bitpush News on Twitter!","tags":[],"author":"Bitpush News","creation_date":"2024-05-01"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/neo-smart-economy/introducing-melkbot-to-neos-discord-server-0b4c3d0ae27b","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Today, we’re excited to announce that we’ve officially incorporated MelkBot into Neo’s Discord community.

Every time the industry is shaken, it gives us the opportunity to reiterate why we chose to come here in the first place, what we believe in, and the purpose of what we are trying to accomplish as an industry. Personally, I believe crypto and blockchain is the exchange of value, just like the internet became the exchange of information, and I believe their journey share many similarities. Bitcoin was created out of the 2008 financial crisis as a response to the broken Fiat experiment, which has been running for 51 years now. Bitcoin was created with the belief that the financial system should be better. However, 2022 showed us the ugly truth of when centralized entities are mismanaged and why Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the Bitcoin Network, was smarter than we thought (and we thought he was pretty damn smart in the first place). The industry suffers as a result of becoming the very thing it was created as a response to. It’s time to slam on the brakes, evaluate, and go back to the roots.The year of withdrawal halts — 3AC, Celcius, Voyager and FTX2022 will be remembered as the year of “withdrawal halts”. It all started in May with the crash of Terra LUNA, an algorithmic stablecoin, that turned out to be poorly designed and ultimately led to a $60 billion wipe-out of the industry. The contagion quickly spread as a wild fire, ultimately bringing down financial corporations like 3AC, Celsius and Voyager as the biggest entities to suffer from the crash. As a result, the market naturally started to decline in value, removing around $1 trillion of its market-cap in a month. Despite the turmoil, it seemed like we were fine for a couple of months. The market stabilized and sentiments were strong. Remember, these scenarios happen in tech, in finance and even in any industry over time. It’s a part of the maturing process. After all, a revolution of this size takes decades to emphasize. Just look at the impact of the internet that is celebrating its 50th year anniversary next year with the introduction of the TCP/IP. However, on Nov 9, all hell broke loose because the “safe, regulated way to buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital assets” declared themselves insolvent, and not just by a bit, but to a degree that makes Enron look like a puppy. Funds at FTX were not safe! At first, it seemed confusing that a spot exchange could be “insolvent”? How can a spot exchange that takes in user deposits and lets those users trade and have fun buying shitcoins, and when done, let those users withdraw what’s left - how can that lead to insolvency? It’s not like FTX took users’ funds and operated like some sort of a fractional reserve bank in which they could use funds to leverage the shit off the roof.Except, that’s exactly what they did. Or should I say he. SBF. Sam Bankmann-Fried. FTX took billions of dollars in customer deposits and gave it to its sister company, Alameda Research (the trading company of SBF’s former empire). Alameda then went broke on speculative bets with money they didn’t own, couldn’t pay back the money, and it all fell apart after Binance announced it was selling its pot of FTT tokens due to discrepancies between CZ (CEO, Binance) and SBF. The tweet sparked a massive sell-off in FTT tokens, which, oh by the way, constituted a large portion of the entire FTX balance sheet. Yup, you read it correctly; FTX was largely backed by its own token which it had leveraged to a degree never seen before. If it sounds familiar, this is exactly what happened to Celcius earlier this year, loaning/leveraging user deposits for speculative bets without disclosing it to their customers. It’s bad and it’s fraudulent and it resonates the main problem that currently shakes the industry to unprecedented scales. However, let me be very clear! 3AC, Celcius, Voyager and FTX all share the same common issue, which is they were all large centralized entities, ruled by bad actors, in which greed and negligence led to their downfall. None of this can be attributed to either Bitcoin nor the blockchain technology itself as a revolutionary innovation. This was systemic risk, build around the technology that failed or, as the new CEO of FTX, John Ray, puts it, “This is really old-fashioned embezzlement. This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose, not sophisticated at all” — Wall Street Journal 13/12–22”.Last time I checked, miners on the Bitcoin network were still adding blocks to the chain, and validators on Ethereum were still actively running transactions as nothing happened. Now, as the end of 2022 is approaching, it’s time to leave false narratives as a thing of the past. The collapse of these heavily centralized entities is not an indictment on crypto. Actually, it’s quite the opposite; “It’s a concrete demonstration of the need for more, better decentralized, trust-free technology” — Gavin Wood, 25/11–22, Twitter.Centralization failure led to the downfall of all these companies. Blockchain, with its ability to enable decentralization, is the solution, not the problem.Regulation is coming!Never ever have I been this professionally angry with a person as I am with SBF. FTX and SBF had become some sort of white knight for the industry, being the responsible and compliant guy in the room. SBF had ties to the congress of the U.S., given the opportunity to speak with congress and various regulatory bodies such as the SEC and CFTC on future crypto regulation. In other words, he was the man that could move the needle in DC. Now, SBF faces up to115 years in prison if convicted of all charges against him. I’m angry because his greed and negligence has set back the industry, adding fuel to the fire and ultimately made it harder for other honest entrepreneurs and well-managed companies in the space.Obviously, regulators are pissed! They were fooled by a guy in a t-shirt and flip-flops and they are now showing up to the party with a sledge hammer and a message burned into the head of the hammer pointing to the industry. It feels like we did this to ourselves. We gave the regulators a chance to come hard at us. But let’s be clear about something. These examples wouldn’t necessarily have been solved with regulation. These things happen in traditional finance as well, which is heavy regulated. Just look back at the financial crisis in 2008. The only difference here is that in crypto, capitalism rules without any backstop funded by taxpayers to rescue what’s dying. The sad thing in the cases of Terra Luna, FTX etc. is that a lot of people lost their savings, and for them, I feel sorry and hope they get back on their feet.In my view, regulators are far from innocent in what we see in the crypto industry and especially the FTX case. It feels like we, as an industry, are the bad actors, but what about the U.S. government? In the case of the federal reserve, it has doubled its balance sheet during the Covid-19 crisis via quantitative easing, from $4 to $8 trillion. This is what both FTX and Terra Luna tried to do. To print their own private currencies, to prop up their asset-books and valuations, however, they were not sovereign. They could not force anyone to use their currencies under the threat of violence. The state on the other hand can, and the bill always ends up in the hands of the people, either through taxes or inflation. I’m not saying that SBF shouldn’t end up in jail, because I think it is pretty clear from the evidence that he committed fraud. I’m just saying that maybe they learned from the best, and one should be careful about pointing fingers. After all, debt is a game of confidence and at some point that confidence is gone, also in the state.My hope for regulators is that they come together and try to make this right once and for all, and not to ban and over-regulate the space because some criminals took advantage of this new technology. It is about time we get some clarity and just to be clear, I believe regulation is absolutely necessary for the industry if we ever hope to accomplish more than just being some speculative assets you can invest in.As favorable the U.S. government was for the internet in its beginning, as adverse have they been when it comes to regulation for the blockchain space. See this table below on how the Internet vs. Blockchain industry compare in terms of %market-cap and their origin.It is very clear that entrepreneurs in the blockchain space haven’t seen the U.S. as a favorable place to conduct their business like they did in the Internet era and as such, 95% of the market-cap is located outside of the U.S. Crypto regulation in the U.S. has been and still is hard to navigate and so far, regulators haven’t been able to provide any workable framework for how these services can be offered. The SEC, CFTC and other regulatory bodies can’t even agree on what should be determined securities or commodities besides that it is commonly thought that Bitcoin is not a security. Hence, entrepreneurs and builders in the space are afraid to conduct business for fear of litigation. They don’t want to break the rules, but right now they have no clue about what the rules are.What does the future look like for this industry?I have been active in the industry since early 2017 which by now makes me somewhat experienced, even though I wasn’t early to come in. I have seen several bull and bear cycles, and the good thing about these cycles is that there are always learning experiences to be made and to use for the future. So far I have only discussed all the bad things we experienced in 2022, but what about all the positive things we saw? Was it really that bad of a year? Absolutely not! In fact, despite all the negative things that always tend to draw all the medias attention, I’m more bullish and positive in regards to this industry than ever before. Personally, I believe that the biggest event in 2022 was the successful merge on Ethereum with the beacon-chain, removing the Proof of Work consensus mechanism and shifting towards a Proof of Stake consensus instead. This was done on September 15th and went through without any bumps and transactions still running simultaneously. Just to put this in to scope, it’s like changing the engine of an airplane, WHILE IT IS IN THE AIR! Amazing! Ethereum is soon to be a deflationary, yield generating (through staking) and primary base layer for Web3 assets. For anyone interested, I’d suggest you read more about the Ethereum roadmap.I also have to mention Bitcoin as a positive light to a dark year. As I wrote in my intro, Satoshi Nakamoto was smarter than we thought. Despite what the term cryptocurrencies has come to mean and be affiliated with, such as ponzi schemes and joke coins, Bitcoin is not a token issued by any company nor a scheme to create fake value underwriting bad debt. It differs from the rest and should be treated as such. Bitcoin is a scarce, peer-to-peer, censorship resistant digital currency, designed to keep your money safe through any political or economical storm.. Of course, Bitcoin is still volatile in the short term, but historically and in the long term, it’s the best performing asset ever in human history. The question then becomes, are you patient enough to see this play out? Despite the turmoil the industry has been through, it’s still trading around $17.000, which is quite impressive.Remember what I said about learning experiences from various cycles? I think 2022 gave us many very important learnings, however, two aspects really comes to my mind; DeFi and self-custody.It’s actually quite hard to separate the two things, because DeFi can only exist through self-custody and it’s a key metric of using DeFi services. However, the reason why I want to highlight self-custody, is because self-custody does not have to be affiliated with DeFi. It can really just stand alone and be an important reminder of “not your keys, not your coins”. In the case of FTX, Celcius and other bankrupt entities, $billions of user funds were lost as a result of customers not being in control of their assets, but instead relied on those entities to safeguard their assets. Instead, user funds could have been self-custodialized and $millions if not $billions could have been safe. Onwards, I think we will see this narrative change and users will become more familiar and safe with self-custody solutions, as the UI experience in wallet providers and DeFi services improves over time. Also, let’s not forget that crypto’s initial promise was to provide people with the choice of being their own bank. I acknowledge that this is not something that will apply to everyone, and for those of us who were privileged enough to be born in a system, where we were granted access to a bank account before we could walk, we will be the last to adopt the narrative of self-custody. However, let’s not forget that approximately 1.4 billion people still remain unbanked, and for those, crypto and hereby self-custody solutions impose life changing opportunities.What about DeFi then? For those of you who are new to this industry, DeFi is short for Decentralized Finance. DeFi really became a thing back in the summer of 2020 and has grown larger ever since, and despite all the hype and projects that have emerged in DeFi, such as the BAYC NFT’s or several “FOMO” yield generating products with unrealistic %APY’s, the idea behind DeFi and blockchain are the answer to many classic centralization risks we saw this year. Why is that? Because DeFi removes the risk of subjective, interest-conflicted and biased human decisions and replaces it with solid, transparent and immutable code. In DeFi, people do not have to trust their counter-party like users did with FTX, when they thought their money was safe. Instead, the rules of engaging with each other are coded into the smart contract. In that way, both parties have transparency and due to the immutable nature, no party can twist or change the “truth” of the engagement. The code just executes what both parties signed up to.2022 gave us some real world examples of how DeFi can be used to de-risk the old centralized systems. Both Celcius and BlockFI, which was another lender that went bankrupt, was conducting business with counterparties that invested some of their funds in DeFi protocols. What happened next is the true promise of DeFi; both Celcius and BlockFI were forced by smart-contracts to fulfill their DeFi loans, otherwise their collateral would have been liquidated. This made Celcius prioritize to pay back their DeFi loans up to $400 million due to the nature of the over-collateralization of 150% for taking the loan on several DeFi protocols such as Maker and Compound. If they wouldn’t have paid back their loans, the collateral would have been used to pay back the lenders in the DeFi protocol, making sure no one would have lost their money, except Celcius who didn’t live up to its obligations agreed upon in the smart-contract. In DeFi, a deal is a deal and there is no going back. In the case of the centralized FTX, unfortunately customers are very unlikely to recover their money after being victims of bad human decision-making.Now, as I mentioned earlier, more sufficient regulation could, maybe to some degree, have avoided some of the bankruptcies this year. Centralized exchanges (CEX) will continue to play a significant role in the space, and I do believe we need both alliances, CEX and DEX, in the industry. After all, we still need FIAT on/off ramps to onboard more customers and custodians for those who are not comfortable with holding their own assets, yet. I think Coinbase, Kraken and Bitcoin Suisse to mention a few, are all very good options and can work great. However, DeFi imposes huge opportunities for the industry to hold itself to higher standards by becoming more self-regulated. In the case of FTX, if the exchange would have been made up by smart contract protocols like we see in DeFi, all activity on the exchange would have been fully transparent, verifiable and auditable by its users and hereby also regulators (hint, hint).I sincerely believe that DeFi is the future of finance even though it still has some growing pains it needs to mature from as with any new technology. It is clear that DeFi impose huge opportunities to solve the risk and limitations we’ve seen throughout this year and with centralized finance of old. It provides transparency, verifiability, auditability and self-custody as a response against poor human decisions, because; “When finance is based on the subjective behaviors of men, it will be prone to the failures of men” — Erik Voorhees, Money and State, 2022.Final thoughtsHistorically, the market bottoms every time Bitcoin and blockchain is dead and the world goes under. I think we are very much in the middle of that narrative at the moment. The truth is, the world is not going under, and Bitcoin or the technology itself isn’t going anywhere. The flood of bankruptcies we saw in 2022, especially with the implosion of FTX, is certainly a setback for the industry on the short-term. However, on the positive note, we get rid of bad actors and hopefully this will accelerate the timeline of crypto-related regulation that we have been waiting for, which makes it essential for builders and entrepreneurs in the space to scale their businesses. Furthermore, DeFi has come out as the big winner from all these series of events, as it shows the unmatched opportunities that lie within the use of it. To be honest, DeFi is the ultimate solution to the problem of trust in financial markets. My prediction is that we will see more innovation and groundbreaking services within DeFi than in any other industry on the planet over the next 5 to 10 years. I know for a fact, that my eyes will be laser-focused on the development of this industry. Oh, and then I haven’t even mentioned zero-knowledge proofs. Well, that’s for another article on its own!Now, it’s hard to come with any predictions as to where this industry is headed in the short term. We still live in an environment with too many uncertainties such as a 40 year high inflation as a result of FED hiking interest rates, increasing energy prices mainly due to the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war and just a general hangover from irresponsible Covid-19 policy decisions. These are all indications as to why the crypto winter could last longer this time. However, I still believe that we are in a very different place this time from previous crypto winter cycles. First of all, institutional adoption remains high. We see many take a long-term perspective and realize the opportunity of this industry as such, while also accepting the natural cycles that follows. Looking forward, I believe the evolution of the industry of digital assets will be focused a lot around tokenization, DeFi and Web3 applications. Bitcoin will remain strong, as its core principles haven’t changed, while Ethereum has strengthened their position as the leader of L1’s in a competitive area with many competing for the same users and capital. With its succesful merge and strong community, I believe in a reinforcing Ethereum narrative in 2023 and onwards.As a final note, I’d like to reiterate my initial statement regarding the evolution of the internet era and how it shares many similarities with crypto. Remember what happened in the dot-com era in the 1990\u0027s? It was a stock market bubble as a result of massive growth in the use and adoption of internet. The bust resulted in a flood of bankruptcies and transformations across the entire industry. However, I think it is safe to say that the technology “internet” survived. Rest is history!Thank you 2022, may we never see you again.Happy new year. 2023 is warmly welcomed.Sincerely,Nikolaj Rosenthal","tags":["Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Defi","Web3","Crypto"],"author":"Nikolaj Rosenthal","creation_date":"2022-12-27"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@michaelfoster26/the-worlds-first-quadrillionaire-revealed-e1e69487c4b3","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"In 1916, John D.

Rockefeller became the world’s first billionaire, and in the hundred years since we haven’t had a trillionaire. And today, not only do we have a trillionaire, we also have the world’s first quadrillionaire. Thanks to the wonders of modern technology and finance, the world’s richest man alive today also happens to be the richest man in history, and by a substantial margin.Now, there’s debate on who the richest man in history was–how do you mark to market Mansa Musa’s massive empire? How can you estimate the value of all of Egypt under the rule of Augustus? Whether the Roman emperor’s wealth made him a trillionaire in modern USD terms, and whether Mansa Musa was richer than him thanks to his trade in commodities (salt, gold, slaves), it doesn’t really matter anymore. Because now the richest man in history is, quite literally, exponentially richer than them both.And he’s not dead yet, which is also pretty good for the pocketbook.To show just how much richer the richest person alive is right now, let’s go through some quick numbers. If we accept the old Times article’s estimate that Augustus’s net worth was $4.6 trillion, that is still a good $995.4 trillion less than the world’s richest man. In other words, the wealthiest person alive could buy and sell Augustus and his Egyptian holdings over two hundred times–and still have tens of trillions left over to take a short vacation somewhere.Source: AuthorThanks to the wonders of modern technology, we have entered a new world of once incomprehensible wealth. Financial innovation thanks to cutting edge technologies, from the foundations of the internet and cloud computing to the specialized proprietary technologies of artificial intelligence, DeFi, Web3, and blockchain, has created the kind of illustrious wealth and power that previous epochs would find incomprehensible.We live in a new era of new possibilities. So now, I would like to introduce you to the richest man on the planet and how he earned a net worth of $1,000,000,000,000,000 before anyone else could.It’s me.How I Did ItHello, my name is Michael Foster and I am the world’s first quadrillionaire. I have to admit, I have never been motivated by money, so becoming the richest person of all time is pretty heady. It’s also a little scary–I’ve installed some security cameras at home. I might get a dog.Doing so was neither simple nor easy, and I did not get here alone. I have to thank my business partners, many of whom you will be familiar with. I would like to thank my partnership with Alphabet (GOOG), the Mountain View-based tech firm that has provided the extremely foundational technology that has made this wealth creation possible. Of course, one must also thank Satoshi Nakamoto for being the first domino in this wonderful trip. But there are so many illustrious people to have come before me! Do Kwon, Mark Karpeles…the list really does go on and on.To the innovators! To the crazy ones!But my biggest gratitude goes out to Sam Bankman-Fried, whose innovations in cryptocurrency have changed the rules forever. And while SBF is not the most beloved person on Earth right now, thanks to all of that fraud and stuff, I didn’t lose any money so I can’t blame him too much.And while SBF did a little oopsie and has seen his personal net worth go down from $19 billion to, well, something, his trailblazing is truly a sight to behold in wonder and adoration. Having innovated in the crypto space, SBF is now working towards new innovations in the legal space. While I can’t get into details here too much, so far we’ve seen 100,000 claims against his FTX that could easily turn into over a million, thanks to the very large userbase of FTX. If he is convicted for each claim separately, and if he gets 2 years in prison per conviction, he could be facing a prison sentence of over 2 million years.And for that, I applaud SBF; after inspiring me to innovate in the crypto world to have the largest personal net worth in history, SBF is himself innovating in the world of self-incrimination to have the longest prison sentence in history. This altruism, it must be said, is very effective.I must admit, I have learned from SBF’s mistakes. By taking money from the outside, by allowing people to trade in his cryptocurrency, and by making massive promises of future profits to customers, SBF got himself in some legal hot water. I’ve decided to avoid all of these pitfalls by not selling my token to outsiders. This produces infinite scarcity that is a solid defense against price declines for my token while also giving me complete and total control of its value relative to fiat currencies, other cryptocurrencies, and other stores of value.The token is called Super Buckaroo Fun Coins (SBF Coin) and they are all in my own personal wallet. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at our balance sheet.Source: Author (note how I took a full screenshot so you know there’s nothing hiding anywhere!)Note first how I have learned from SBF’s mistakes. Upon releasing his balance sheet, SBF did not get a good response. Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted that it’s “an Excel file full of the howling of ghosts and the shrieking of tortured souls”. Well, note how my balance sheet is a Google Sheet, not Excel, so clearly different.Note the lack of liabilities, too. Since I hold 100% SBFCoin and have no clients or counterparties, I have no need to ask for a bailout–a problem that is keeping SBF awake (as well as stimulants?) as he reaches out to investors for a potential bailout (sorry, SBF, I have enough to bail out FTX’s missing $8 billion approximately 125,000 times over with SBFCoin, but I’ve got some friends over so I’m a bit too busy to help out).Boring Financial Stuff (go ahead and skip this bit)At its current valuation, the current quadrillion SBFCoins in circulation are worth $1 each, making the total market cap of SBFCoins $1 quadrillion. This also means that SBFCoins are the largest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market cap.Current trading volumes for SBFCoins are massive. I like trading with myself (no kinkshaming, okay?), so I tend to trade about $900b in net worth of my SBFCoins per day, on average. That daily average volume has been increasing lately because bigger numbers are fun, and it’s worth noting that trades execute in a millisecond, much faster than other cryptocurrencies and stocks traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges.Boring Technical Stuff (go ahead and skip this too)SBFCoin is a robust decentralized DeFi platform using cutting-edge Web3 technologies to unlock value and provide extremely fast transactions thanks to an internal proprietary accounting mechanism built on the back of proprietary Google AI-driven SaaS innovations in cloud computing-based database tools (i.e., I’ve got a Google Sheet). It is a cryptocurrency utilizing the following AI-driven DAO-backed gas-free zero-slippage mining-free protocol that is both gasless and offers PoS-backed smart contract executions:t̴̖͙̮͐̿̈̏̃̿͋͆̊͋͘͘͝ḧ̷̟̻̜̜̬́̿̈́̎̌̂̂͌i̷̡̬͎͕͛ş̸̨̯̮͕̣͖̫̜̮̘̟͙͊̀̀̓͗̌͂ ̶̻̫̲̊̊̉ḭ̷̧̧̡͓̪͎̥̦̀̉̾̀̓̔̈́͗̓̉̑̔̌̋̍s̴̛̛̗̹̣͎̻̦̝̙̖͇͑͛̅̅̎̑̾̔̓̆͝͝͝ͅͅ ̴̜̻̹̯̠̜͕̇̀̿́͋̄̿̒̈́̏͘̚͘̕͝ả̸̢̙̹̼̤͖͎̝̭̻͗̄̾͌́͛́͆̎̇̚͝ ̵̬̯̣̲̜̙̙̳̹͕͎̀̓̚͝s̷̢̢̼̤̥̘̻̻͖͙̝̽̊̊͒̆͒̈́̾͘͜å̸̢̫̹̪̘̈́͘ẗ̸͍͇̯̤͉̙̭̘̥͆̔̌̓͊̅ḯ̶͇͎̻͕͚̜̩ŗ̶̞̗̠͇̬͔͛̈́̈̔̉̈́͐ĭ̵̢̦̜̥̞̻̤̟̼͇̪͔̮̈͒̈́̓͌͗̃͜c̵̠̾̆̓̿͂̈́̆̑̏̇͂͆̉ã̵̝̮͙̖̝̫̱̖̫̼͖͓̋̚͠ͅl̶͓̼̞̜̙̣̲̗̜̝̲̟̪̫͂́ ̵͓̬̮̫̘̭̫̒̃̈͐͗́̈̌̓͜ǰ̷̡̬̗̝̰́͒̊̎̈́̒̓̓͛̚͜ͅo̷̧̲̼͓͈͎͍̤̣̹̣̹̔̌͐̃͑́̉̕̕͝ḵ̷̘̅̆̈́̂̃̽͝ȇ̴̪̺̒ ̸̛͖͍̦̈͆̂̇̂͐͋̂͝͠t̸̨͓̹̲͉̘̰̗̘͓̞̑̋͐̉̌̿̈́̌́̎́͛͠ͅo̸̧̢̡̳̞̪̼̗͉̗̥̝̥͋̀̀̒̅̚͜ ̵͍͖͈̘̞̦̅͋̉͐̄̉̕͜ͅp̵̡̜̞̤̱̞͎͗́̇́̍́̃̐̾̌̽ͅǫ̸̭̠͎̈̀͆̃̐̈̆͑̈̕͘͝i̶̢̡͍̬̯͓̼̮̹͈̦͍͍̪̍̀̿̎́n̷̢̛̥̱͋̏̏͊͆̈́͋̾t̵̪̦̲̤̺͚̩̹̤̺̦̟̜̩̼̏̄̓̐̀͝ ̴̡̨̯̱̦͈͛̋͑͛͌̓͋̀̈͋́̈́͘̚͝ͅǫ̵̳̘̱͎̮̗̖͖̘͎͎̣̺́̊̋̓̐̄̒͌̎͛̿̆̚̚ủ̵̧̯̦̭͉̈́̔̾͛͗̐͂͘̕͜ţ̷̰̖̜̘̞̞̦̜̠̤̭̤̋̇̈́͝ ̴̛̳̻̫̩͓͈͕̪͉͒͜h̶̟̙͒̋̅̒ō̷̖͕̤̖͇͚̞̚w̴̨̮̥͙̐ͅ ̶̢̤̰̬͈̐̍̊̄̀̂̂̍̐̂͠͠i̷͚̗͖͕̦̫͖͕̫̝̠̣͒̂̈́̌̂́͗́̚̚̕͝n̵̰̹̪͍͇̖͔̞͎̦̯̺̚ç̶̻̫͊̔͛͋̈ŗ̸̡̡̻̹̗̥͙̼̟͉̣̺̠̜̄͑̑̈́̑́̀̎̔̚̚e̷̦͚̱̒̾͂̉̿̈̉̓͒͆͘͝ͅd̸̯̃̄̀̄́͘̚̕͘̕͝ͅi̸̧͔̞̪͖̾̉̿͒̒̉̏̏͐̾́̎́̚͝b̶̬̜͆̿̄̾̑̈́͘l̴̤̋͒̈́̑̀͛͊́̓̋̚̕͘͝y̴̬̖̼̟͊͊̊̋́̚͝͝ ̶̢̼̥͙͔̤̙̳̲̖͚̓́̊̈́͑̃́̊͊́̒s̸̞̜̖̀̌̓̀͂̄̅̏̀̕t̸̪̣͔̹̤̠̒͋͂ŭ̵̠͎̑̀p̴̨͓͖̖͉̫̺̭͉͔͔̟̫̽̈́͌̌̈́͂̈́̇͆͜i̵͔̍̄̇̚d̴͎̖̤͙̟͙̱̠̦͇͎͆͌̉͌̍͌̑̉͗̅̉͜͝͝ ̴̛̝̬̠̞̗̦͚̮̌̀̉͋́͑̓̄͊͜ͅa̷̻̬̺̖̬͉͉͌̈̆̐̃̒̾͊͗̌̚͠n̴̜̰̹̖̬̹̅͊͌̍͂̌̚͠͠d̷̘̹͚͔͉̫̼̻̈́̍͌̀̃̋̿̔͐̕͠͠ ̸̡̛͔͇̹̫̱͍̜̩̞͖̋̄̓̄̈́̅̽͠͝ŏ̷̼̰͗͆̾̾̔̑̚b̴̞̥̝̯̱͔̮̳͈̪̪͓̖̈́v̵̢̢̛͇̞̭͍̾̋̈́̓̅̃̌̕í̸̛̛̛̦͍̮͕̭̗̺̇͛̇͋͑̊̉̾̈͝͠ơ̷̥̜̂͌̋͒̎̅̈̍͛͆̄̇̅̕u̶͇͂̾͋̑s̷̗͍̰͈̥͖͖̻̦̟͕̙̳̳̆̄͗̅̐l̸̥̩̺͎̰̒͒͂͌͐͝͝y̴͈̮͎̼̙̌͑́͘ ̶̤̼̻̥̩̪̗̭̹̮̤̺̀̇f̶͔̦̻͊̄̅̉͛r̴̛̩̩̟̺̝̻̪͚͉̼̟̭̂̀̌̏̈̌̏̉͘͠͝ͅa̸̧̢̛͕̳̗̮͎̻̩̝̯̝̤̗u̸̡͍̟̩̳͍̪̱̲͔̪͊̈́̈́͛̔̔̈͗̊̋̊̽̕͜͝ͅd̵̡̢̦̮̫͚̖̹̼̞̅͗́̋͊̒̈̀͆̏̍́̍͜͠û̵̘̣̈́͊̈̈́͗̆̀͜͝l̴̲̫̖͍̣̳͂ͅȩ̴̨̞͙̝̯̮̜̤̖͈̤̞̜̗͂́̂̇̈̔̐̀͝n̷̢̨̮̼̩̼̘͚͉̖͉͈̎͐̐̃͂͜ͅt̸͔͍͕̞̮̲͕́̎͘ͅ ̴̡̛͕̱͔̹̦̇͌̏̿̅̂̂͊̿̕͜ê̴͉̮̓͒͆̒̈̽̾͛̎͗̑͛v̶̗̖̯̫͌͆̅̈́̽̏͆̏͆̿̐͠ḛ̷̮̪͗̇̍̾̉̒͝r̵͓̳̦̪͔͈̂̐̍̉̔̔͛̾̿͆̆̉ȳ̶̨̖̬̫̜̤̘͇̂̽̋̍̈̔́̓͘͘͘ͅt̶̢̧̞͙̺̥̠̥̜͕́̄̆̏͐̄͜h̷̢͓̮̘͇̥̣̖̪̼̩̀̂̈̅̆̈́̅͘̕ỉ̶̢̩̻̦̪͍͎͚̼̬̂͐̆̓̅̈́͑̐͐̄̋ͅn̴͕͎̘̹̗̳̑̈̓͛́͠g̸̟̬͓̻̭̲̣̿̽͌̂ ̶̥͙̠͈̯͖̗̬̜͓̘̯̲͆̉̓͒͊̒̍̈̄͛̕͘͝ì̴̡̧̮͖̲͇͙͕̖̱̦̣̦̐̇n̵̢̧̺͈̲̬̜̠͎͔̈́͑̂̊̓̆̈́̋͜͝ͅ ̶̬̳̥̬̬̼̰̘̱̏͗͌͠t̴̛̩̼̜̏̃̊̀͛ḩ̴̺̦͉̌̐̈́̊̆͂͂̀͠e̴̙̤̟̗̝̺͙̍̀̈̈́̀̐͂̎͂̅͒̒̚ ̵̨̙̖̼̣̦̠̙̱͋́͌̍̿̾̐͋̚c̶̼̫̖̹̜̟͙̲̙̪̮̫̾̋͛̽̊͛̅̓̐́͂͘̕͜͠ͅr̷̤̤͌̆̃͂̔y̷̡̲̬̜͌ͅͅp̵̧̼͚̯͍͓͖̘̗̭̯̪̜̿̊͝ͅt̶̨̡̨̩̟̩̲̺̲̱̻̼̽͛̇̈́̃̊̄̌̈̏̿̄͘̚ơ̶̳̹̄͂͊̇̿́̈́̐͂͆̋́̕c̶͚̳̣͉͍̯̪̜̩̙̞̑̍̀u̶̱̝̦͓͖̗̠̞̺͛̒͘̕ŕ̷̡͇͖̱̰̻͈̜͔͒̀͐̄͑̄̐͘͝͝r̶͚̻͆͐̂̈͒͜͠ͅę̶̛̤̯̯̠̖̔̽͠ṋ̴̞̝̤͉͖̥̬͖͔̬̭̱͓̌̈̐̏̍͗̅̆̿͊̈́̂͝c̸̟̠̘̳͚͕̞̍̾̅̉͗̓̾̽͘ͅy̵̨̧̩͕̫̭͕̳̩̦͂̏̀̈́̐̈̿̐̽̀͠ͅ ̷̛̗̲͔̟͖̻̔̍̎̓̈́̕͘w̴͔̝̬̟̺̬̉̅͊ờ̶̝̲̅̆̇̈̌̇̕̚r̴̨̨̡̹̭̤̝͍̞͎̞̾͗̈́̄̀́̐͑͘l̶͇̪̜̱̘̻̀̂̎d̴̢̡̲̖̻̹̳̳̭̙̺̏ ̴̙̗̞͂̽͌͐̃͑̀͒͌̋͌̓͛͛̿h̷̨͍͙͎̭͒̀͗̄́̏̿͂̃́͌͠͝ͅa̶̼̳̭̰̝̘̭̎͗̊͐̊̕͠ș̷̛̹̥͖̤̺̜̥̫̳̜̤͖̂́͊͆͒͋͆̍͗̈́̕͜ ̴̘̳͊̀͌̀̇̓̾͌͒͋̚͝͝b̶̙̰͕̜̼͙̞͓̖̮͕̠͕̬͍̑̏̇̈́̅́̃͊̏̈́̇̎͝e̶̡͖̹̮̟͔̣̝̠͍̺͕͊̾̽̾͗̅̀̉̀̃͆̕̕c̴̢̢͔̠̩̝̺̰̥̦̘͎̿͂̌̉̿́̌͆̿͂̍̕̕͜͜͜͝o̷̢̢͚͕̮̙͕̻͇͖͚͇̪͊͆̆̀̿̅͑̃̉͂́̈́m̸̧͓̼̠̫̆́̀͋̃͗͜͝ͅę̵͉͚͇͎̪̟̪̒,̷̘͙̭̦̤̺̲̝͇̬͙͊ ̵̱͎̪̺͚̪̠͔̖̌̀͜͜ą̸̗̖̓͊̈͐̈̈̽͆̃̌̊̚̕s̷̨̧̛̺̑͒̄̋̍͛̈́͝ ̶̡̹̞̳̼̮͎̻̪̼̲̉̓̆̍̿̊̈́͋́̓̌͘̚Ḯ̷͙̝̣̯͕̿̊͂̕ ̵̡̞̘͍̞͉͔͓̹̯̙̪͊̑͋̽̐͌͠͝ẁ̷͔̳̬̲̖̂̊̃͂ͅr̷̞͉͈͕̃ͅợ̶̯̪̽̊̅̏̓̀̽̽̕͝ẗ̶̡͍̫́̀̈́̉̑̌͌e̴̮̜̠̦̊̎͛̑͘̕ ̵̙̱͔̫̪̤̫̙̉̓̐į̶̖̱͓͍̮͔̟͇͍͉̣̥̒͌̀͗n̵͈͈͕̥̯̖̮͔͇͐̎̒̆͊̏̍̾͊͛͜ͅ ̸͔͇̐̿̂́̂̔͒̊̈̽̄́̕͘͘2̴̨̝̬̘̲̫̤̯̣̜̇̄̊̆̍͒͆̈̒̏̐̄͜0̵̨̢̳̳̞̞̝̱̈́1̴̞̭̺͖̩͕͇̰̖̍́̀̑̓8̴̗̗̦̲͚͚̻͕̝͆́͛̎̀̈̉͗,̷̭̜͇͙͕͑̿͆̍̇͝ ̶̡̛̼̪̋͌̃̂̊̐̿̾̓̌̈́͛͛a̷̙̱͖̳̰̗̭̟̱͇̥̙̗̓̏̔͆̂̊̕͘͜͜͝n̸̢̬͈̈̈̊̃̔͐͌̉d̶͉̫̬̮̞͙̞͈̩̬̟͈̺́͋̊͗̄͒͆͒͗̃̈́̂̚͜͝ͅ ̴̡̭̭̱̞͇̲͎͇̣̦̞͐̎͒̃̽̌̆̀̈́̀͊̚͜͜ǐ̷͇̳̞̰͕̰͊͐͆̈́̎̈̃͊̓̚f̵̧͖͍̙̼͕̬̘͂̌̓̋̚̚͝ ̷̲͔͇͂̎͝y̶̡̢̧̝̯̭͇̞̻̦̙̥̜̰̬̽̈́̓̈̑̐̇̏͘͝͠ö̸͉̞͇͍͙́̐̋ų̵̧̭͕̰̱̭̺̰́̓ ̵̧̛̣̳̞͍̭̣̼̤̙̖͈̲̗̓̀̀̓̈́̈̈́̋͗̀̆̆͜a̵̧̟͎͗̊̎̑͠r̷̞͖̰̦͚͇̻̰͚͔̫̬̗̓̇̍̎̍͂͛͐͊͐͊̏̀͗ḙ̴̠̲̖̣̐̓͂̿̈́͛ͅ ̵̢͍̺̦̺̻̒͠s̸̯͉̞͋͂̇̀̈́̃͋͛̐̿t̵̥̟͓͇͉̱̔̇i̶̻̦̍̂̏̍͛̓̌́̚̕̚͠ḻ̵̡̧̛̤̠̜̦̮̲̳̙̻̦̏̍͊̈́͐̒͂̍̌͝l̴̡̨̢̡̧̬͕͈͙̘̣̞͓̇̂̅̂͊̐͛̓̉̀̅͝ ̷̛̺̤̠͈̰̤̖̥̘͍̀̈́̐͐̽̏̚͝i̴̧̩̞̣͎̝͒̓͝n̶̢̛̑̉͂̈ ̵̨̲̪͕̻̰̞͚̹̓̽c̷̡̹̜̝̯̭̝̄̀͌̾̅͋́̕r̸̭̈́͋̒͗̎͋͆̈́͝͠y̴̡̛̹͈̼̍̍͋͊̆̽͗͒͒̈̆̉͝p̸̰̞͎̏t̴̢͚̘̟̰̹̬̠͇̪͒̐͐̔o̷̡̧͔̥͖̝͖̬͔̤͙̤̒̈́̓͐͘ ̷̯̤̇͌͐̇̈́̀̈̂̿͆͝t̴͚̰̼̜̞̘͈̹̼̓͂͐̓̈́͆̑̂ǫ̷̛͍̭̖̮͖̞͆ͅḑ̷͎̜͓͎̣͍̦̘̳͓̯̤͎͆͒́͜à̵̻́̊̾̿͗̓̈́ỹ̴͓̣̠̈́́͛̋͋̌̉̕͠ ̷̣̥͕̳̙̓̾͊̾̈́̈́͆̊͠Ḭ̵͍̰̳̦͕́ ̸̧͕̹̯̳̤͚͉͖͕͊̃h̴̤̳̄̀̉̇̆̉̓̄̕o̴̲̳̬̽̉͗̂̈́͛̊͋̕͘͝͠n̶͓͛̍̃̿͋͝͝ẻ̵͌̎̿̅́̈́̾͐͘ͅs̶̞̩̝̞͔͍̬̓̎̏̐͠ͅţ̸̰̼͖̥̤͗̾̎̍̅̃̃̅́͂̍͝͠͝͝l̷͚̖͓̇̏̍͋̑͐̆̓̕͝͠y̴͍̖̑͛͐̈́͗̀̋ ̷̢̢̧̢̣̹̱͈͔͓̬͍͉̈́t̵̩̪̥̦̦̯̦̫͙͖̗̀̑̄̈́̈́ͅh̵̛̥͚̩̙͉͚͊̃͑͆̉̇̐̉̿̅̚ͅi̴̡̛͇̞̖͕̤͖͔̟̖͋̂͂̂̍̈͗͠ņ̵̡̨̡̨̠͎̦̲̱̺̠̥̤̀̀̚k̵̛̛̖̗͇̫̮̪̜̱͙̏̈́̉̀͒̂́̈́̕͘͝͝ ̴̡͎̤͈͇̹̗̲͈͈̑̂̾́͑͗̽̅͐͜ͅͅỹ̴̙̹̋̊͘ͅȏ̶̥̫͒̇͛͌̆̓̽́̿͒͝͠u̶̖̻͐͌̃̏͋̐̽͑͂́́͗̕͠ ̵̨̭̞̣̬̳̉̈́̊̀̐͘͘͠͠͝å̴̢̪̦̰̤̟͉̽̄̐̋́̽̄͛̋̒̾ŗ̵̨̦͓̬̘̮̑́͆̔̽̊̔̒̊͂́͋̕͝͝ȩ̶̭̖͕̱́̈͌̽͂̇̑͋́̂̆͜ ̴̨̙̘̲͕͙̥̹͙̹̺̳̏̆̊̎͌b̸͙̲̯͇̳͍̙̐̈́̐̑͂̿͊̂͠e̴̡̡̬̺̲̩͈̺̰͍̳̒̉ỹ̶̡̧̢̻̥̲͖̭͈͚̭̺̅o̴̥̔̈́̄̈́̒͊̚ͅn̷̳̘̪̼̯͍̝͔̑̿͗͋̋̄̏̐́̄̓̚͠͠d̸̝̝͉̙͎̭͙͉͋͌́̅͝ͅ ̵̲̯̳̫̦̟͔̫̬̥͛͐̓̋̋̍̏̈́́̈̆h̴̢̢̻̼̠̜̗̞́͗̃͌͂̈́̉͛͗͆͒̿̀ͅè̷̱̄̉̀͝ḽ̴̬̘͓͕̇̈́͝͝ṕ̸̫͕̟̀̽̓͌͆͗͆̊̿̀͂̕̕̚.̴̢̯̳͇̞̬̫̖̙͒͒͒́͜͠Few understand.How You Can ProfitI am not selling SBFCoins for fiat, both to avoid the risks of millions of years in jail time and also to preserve the value of SBFCoins.

I asked myself several questions and below are the answers I got so far.1: Will AGI Be A Reality? If Yes, When?It depends on how we define AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). To me AGI means human-like reasoning, learning, problem solving and continuous improvements. It’s a matter of when not if, though I won’t spend too much time speculating about the timing.As a matter of fact, in the past 18 months or so, one branch of AI — Large Language Models (LLMs) — have made major technology and adoption breakthroughs. ChatGPT reached 100M users in just 2 months, the prior fastest one was Tiktok in 9 months. On the flip side, hallucination remains a major technical gap, besides all these ethical, societal, regulatory and geo-political concerns.I fine-tuned and run a few open source models myself locally on my Apple M2 silicon, even the most performing one — LlaMa3 (8B) — often responded to me with “logical but wrong” hallucinating answers.Obviously there is more work to do before AGI, it might take years or even decades. Nevertheless AI gets more powerful everyday, it can do more types of work and do them more intelligently, see a diagram from The Internet of Agents by Davide Crapis.2: What Are The Roadblocks To AGI?We often hear from people like Sam Altman and Elon Musk that AI scaling law will soon or eventually be constrained by compute, energy and/or training data before AGI. For sure we need a longer term vision and roadmap to revolutionize the GPU and energy industry (e.g. fusion energy), and (using AI to) generate unlimited, diversified, high quality synthetic training data.However, these seemingly new problems can potentially be solved or at least mitigated by existing solutions. In the short to mid term, to me this is an efficiency game in every step of the AI process. We should and must do performance profiling and optimization on training, fine-tuning and inference, e.g. more efficient data and model parallelization, cutting every waste in GPU memory and bandwidth consumptions, quantization, batch and offline inference processing etc. The good news is, Meta’s recent well received LlaMa3 LLM is a perfect example of efficiency meets performance.Another seemingly new problem around the globe GPU / energy shortage, my understanding is it’s more of a distribution problem than an overall supply problem. We should and can find an existing solution to take advantage of all those idle GPUs across data centers and energy across regions, without a longer term GPU rearchitect and revamping of the globe energy network. Crypto could help here (see later discussion).In addition, there are broader ethical, social, regulatory, geopolitical and interdisciplinary implications and challenges, which I will leave to future discussions.3: Large Or Small Language Model?Large Language Models are getting larger and larger. GPT4 has 1.75 trillion parameters, fed with 15 trillion tokens and was trained by 25,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The soon to come GPT5 will certainly out number these, people were speculating massive $2.5B training cost for GPT5.However, models don’t always have to go bigger. Instead of a monolithic approach, we could adopt a modular approach just like any other modern computer systems. We could use a handful of medium/large size models, e.g. LlaMa3 70B, as base models, and build much smaller domain specific incremental models on top of them. During inference, these incremental models can share and connect through the same base model. In this way, one application can access multiple incremental models and base models at the same time. Hence not all these companies have to build their own super, costly and largely overlapped generalized model, instead we can keep expanding the overall model capability with an open community, building and sharing base models and incremental domain specific models on top of each other. (see the below diagram)Moreover, companies like Apple and Microsoft are experimenting in a different direction. Instead of LLMs, they are building SLMs (Small Language Models), e.g. Apple OpenELM (270M, 450M, 1.1B, 3B) and Microsoft Phi-3 Mini (3.8B), both trying to balance model size and performance. They may not be as powerful and general as LLMs like ChatGPT 4, Claude 3 Opus, let alone the incoming GPT 5/6, but they could be very suitable for cases like edge AI on smaller IoT devices without reliable internet connection, or privacy sensitive scenarios like Amazon Alexa or Google Home or certain highly regulated industry where data needs to be kept on premises. SLMs inference can be 100% hosted on edge like a mobile device, without touching any remote servers or internet at all.4: Does AI Need Crypto? And Vice Versa.While AI does not inherently “need” crypto to function, and vice versa, the integration of these technologies could lead to significant advances in both fields. Each can enhance the capabilities and address the limitations of the other, potentially leading to more robust, efficient, and trustworthy systems.What can Crypto do for AI?What can AI do for Crypto?5: What Are The Challenges To Bring AI On-chain?Let’s start with a quick comparison between AI and Crypto for their default settings:As you can see, AI and Crypto defaults are different or even quite opposite in most dimensions. Bringing AI on-chain presents a set of unique challenges that stem from the fundamental differences in how these technologies are designed and operated. Here are some of the key challenges and possible solutions:Conclusion: (Generated by chatGPT)As we stand at the crossroads of two revolutionary technologies, AI and crypto, the potential for transformative change is immense. The integration of AI’s deep learning capabilities with blockchain’s secure and decentralized framework promises to redefine how we handle data, execute transactions, and build trust in digital interactions. However, as outlined, challenges such as scalability, verifiability, data privacy and regulatory compliance remain formidable but not insurmountable.While the technical hurdles are significant, the opportunities — for efficiency, security, and new business models — are profound. Innovations like intent-based smart contracts and enhanced security for crypto platforms highlight just the beginning of what’s possible when these technologies converge. However, as we push forward, a balanced approach that considers ethical, social, and economic implications is crucial.","tags":["Blockchain","Large Language Models","Artificial Intelligence","Cryptocurrency"],"author":"Shenghu Yang"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/chainargos/binances-billions-are-backed-but-you-re-probably-asking-the-wrong-question-df7c19e652ae","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The crypto industry is obsessed with figuring out if digital assets are actually backed by anything, but they should be careful what they…","title":"Binance’s Billions are Backed, but You’re Probably Asking the Wrong Question","detailed_content":"","tags":[],"author":"Patrick Tan","creation_date":"2022-12-21"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@CoinMiningLycan/discover-the-top-10-cryptocurrency-mining-apps-for-2024-mine-for-free-256247c6d195","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Cryptocurrency mining has evolved, and with the right apps, you can streamline the process significantly.

In Q3, the sector that received the largest amount of VC dollars according to the ETI report was Web3 with nearly $900 million. That’s more than fintech, biotech, security, ecommerce, gaming, and dozens of other mainstream industries.And Q3 wasn’t the first time that Web3 topped the ETI report. In fact, Web3 has led the ETI rankings for 5 consecutive quarters now. Over the past 12 months, there has been over $6.5 billion of ETI capital invested into Web3, which is more than double that of the next highest category of fintech at $2.7 billion.Even with all the ongoing challenges across cryptocurrency, which has seen its combined market capitalization decline by 2/3 since last November, investment interest in the sector remains stronger than other industries. Why? Because entrepreneurs still want to start Web3 companies.Building a good Web3 startup is hard. Explaining what makes a startup Web3 in the first place is even harder. Here are a few attempts. Leading Web3 investor A16Z describes Web3 as “the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens”. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3, describes it as “an alternative vision of the web, where the services that we use are purely algorithmic things hosted by everybody”. Web3 has also been called “the hyperfinancialization of all human existence” and where “every product is simultaneously an investment opportunity”. Pretty confusing right?Here’s a simpler definition: a Web3 startup interacts with data stored on a blockchain. That’s it. Read from Ethereum via an RPC provider? You’re a Web3 company. Send a transaction on the Solana network? Web3. Implement a Connect Wallet button on your website? Same. Blockchains, the public shared ledgers of information, are the data building blocks of Web3, and if you use any of this data in your product, then you’re part of Web3 too.Now why is this interesting to entrepreneurs? Because we haven’t had free access to data in a long time.All consumer products need data. If you’re building a restaurant discovery website, you need reviews. If you’re building a shopping app, you need a product catalog. If you’re building a photo or music or video sharing service, you need (obviously) photos or music or videos. Sure you can get users to create that data for you — after all, users authoring data is the core tenet of Web2. But it takes a lot of users to create a useful amount of data, and until then the product experience for those few initial users will be incomplete or simply bad, which is then an impediment to acquiring more users. So you’re stuck in not a vicious cycle, but a stagnant cycle.For entrepreneurs from a decade plus ago, data used to be readily available online. You could crawl it (ex. Airbnb crawling apartment listings from Craigslist), or subscribe to it via RSS feeds that publishers were widely distributing. Platforms like Facebook and Google were also generous with their data providing robust API access (remember all the social games that used Facebook’s Graph API?). There was once even an entire category of products called mashups predicated around this idea of shared data that was composable.Unfortunately for entrepreneurs today, data is no longer easily accessible. RSS has been largely abandoned, most sites prohibit crawling and will sue to prevent it, and platform APIs from Facebook and others have either been shut down entirely or severely limited. More than ever, the web is a collection of walled data gardens controlled by a handful of gatekeepers and for good reason: the data and the infrastructure running that data is incredibly valuable. Gartner last year reported that 80% of the global cloud infrastructure market is controlled by just 5 companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, and Huawei. It’s no coincidence that these are 5 of the most valuable technology companies in the world.The “haves” (companies with data) generally no longer want to share with the “have nots” (startups), which is why Web3 has become so attractive to entrepreneurs: you get to build with data in Web3. With blockchains, data is freely available to everyone. There are no gatekeepers to blockchain data because ownership is decentralized across tens of thousands of individuals or entities running their own shared copies of the data. You can spin up your own Ethereum node in a matter of minutes and download the entire blockchain onto about 1TB of storage. That would fit on many laptops so there’s not a lot of expensive infrastructure you need either.Because of blockchain ledgers, data access in Web3 is equal. Every startup has access to the same tokens, wallet addresses, transaction history, etc. and can build as complete a customer experience as any other company. We’re all “haves” in Web3, but is what we have useful? In other words, Web3 startups can now build new products that are filled from day one with all of this public blockchain data. But does this public blockchain data help make products that customers actually want to use?There has been one dominant customer value proposition for all Web3 startups this year. One powerful use case that all of their Web3 products — from games to art to fitness tracking — have been helping customers with: making money. During the last crypto bull market, every Web3 product became a speculative asset, and making money became the only scenario Web3 companies had to think about. When your product promises to generate positive returns for customers, it doesn’t have to promise much else.Take for example NFTs, which rocketed in popularity this year with millions of people owning them. In the bull market, NFT startups focused all their energy on helping those million users make money because the primary use case for NFTs was financial speculation. In their pursuit of driving up the price, most NFT product innovation centered around building reward systems for holding onto NFTs (i.e. staking) as well as creating walled gardens around NFT ownership (i.e. token gated content). But those features came at the expense of investments into arguably more interesting product explorations like being able to do things with NFTs and have them interact with other projects.Remember, NFTs are stored on blockchains where the data is freely accessible by anyone. Therefore, Web3 entrepreneurs should be building all sorts of novel, interoperable experiences with NFTs, just like Web2 entrepreneurs did with mashups. But because everyone was so obsessed with just the floor price, NFT projects built entire products designed to keep people from doing anything with their NFTs or having them interact with any other project. The pursuit of financial speculation above all else took data that was inherently open and made it closed.But now we’re in a downmarket where returns are negative. Web3 products can no longer rely on just the use case of making people money, and have to provide other value to earn the time and patronage of customers. We’re going to see a lot of entrepreneurial time and energy shift from innovating on financial speculation to pursuing new ideas for what you can do with data stored on shared ledgers besides making money. Will customers find these new scenarios valuable? Will products filled with public blockchain data be useful?Who knows for sure. But because entrepreneurs still want to build Web3 startups and investors want to fund these companies, we’re about to find out.","tags":[],"author":"Eric Feng","creation_date":"2022-12-04"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/utopian/crypto-is-dead-39b2c0f98e47","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"I’ve been in crypto for years now, I saw it all — the highs, the lows, and the memes.

That milestone would unfortunately begin a three year downturn across the entire Internet sector. The NASDAQ would go on to fall 50% by the end of 2000, and continue dropping before bottoming out at 1,114 on October 9, 2002.During the dotcom bubble as the NASDAQ was soaring, usage of the technology powering the dotcom bubble — the Internet — was also soaring. The number of Internet users doubled from 150 million at the beginning of 1999 to 300 million in March 2001 as the NASDAQ peaked. But when the NASDAQ crashed, Internet usage did not follow suit. During the period when the NASDAQ plummeted to its low point in October 2002, the number of Internet users doubled again to 600 million.So for the runup of the dotcom bubble, pricing of Internet technology (as measured by the NASDAQ) and usage of Internet technology (as measured by the number of Internet users) was directly correlated. As the NASDAQ went up, so did the number of Internet users. But when the dotcom bubble popped, pricing and usage became uncorrelated. As the NASDAQ fell, the number of Internet users actually grew. This growth would go on to fuel and even greater peak for the NASDAQ many years later.The lesson here? Pricing is only one measure of success.On November 8, 2021, the global cryptocurrency markets reached an all time high of a combined $2.9T in market capitalization. Like the dotcom bubble, cryptocurrency also grew an astounding 6x during this crypto bubble, but accomplished that feat not in 5 years but in only 1 year. It was the equivalent of the entire inflating of the dotcom bubble happening in just 12 months.Over the next 8 months, the crypto bubble would pop sending the cryptocurrency market cap plummeting by two-thirds to below $1T, and triggering disastrous events like the crash of the Terra stablecoin, the bankruptcy of Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, and the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celcius along the way. Across the board, the prices for all the major Layer 1 blockchains fell significantly from their highs from November 2021: Bitcoin from $68.7k to $20k, Ethereum from $4.9k to $1.5k, Solana from $260 to $30, and so on.But as the crypto bubble popped, what has happened with usage of the blockchains, which is the technology that powered the crypto bubble in the first place? As the price of blockchain technology (as measured by cryptocurrency market cap) has fallen, has usage of blockchain technology fallen too? Let’s find out.First, let’s look at usage of the Bitcoin blockchain, which represents almost 40% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. During the runup of the crypto bubble from 2019 to 2021, Bitcoin payments per day (which is one measure of Bitcoin usage) was directly correlated with the price of Bitcoin — as price went up and down, so too did the number of payments. But starting this year as Bitcoin price has fallen by half, the number of Bitcoin payments has held steady. In 2022, Bitcoin price and Bitcoin usage have become uncorrelated.A similar trend is also happening with Ethereum, the second largest blockchain representing almost 20% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. Before 2022, Ethereum price and Ethereum usage (this time measured by active addresses, which is similar to active users of Ethereum) were directly correlated. But despite the crash in Ethereum’s price in 2022, the number of active addresses has not fallen this year. Again, usage becoming uncorrelated with price.There are more signs of price and usage becoming uncorrelated in other crypto markets. Crypto development company Alchemy published a recent blog post observing that developer usage of blockchains (as measured by downloads of popular development libraries Ether.js and Web3.js) is up 178% this year, the fastest rate of growth ever. And that’s despite the crypto pricing downturn.According to DappRadar, leading Solana NFT marketplace Magic Eden has seen rapid growth in transaction volume this year, growing from an average of 230k daily transactions in January to over 880k daily transactions now. As the price of Solana has dropped over 80% this year, Solana usage (as measured by NFT trading activity on Magic Eden) is up 280%, another sign of blockchain pricing and usage becoming uncorrelated.This is not to say that all is well with the cryptocurrency market. There has been a lot of real pain caused by the downturn, and there is still a lot of uncertainty ahead. But so was the case in the year 2000 with the Internet when pricing crashed. Yet from that crash, usage of the Internet, uncorrelated from pricing of the Internet, would grow and from that growth spark a rebound. It would take 15 years before the NASDAQ recovered to its dotcom bubble highpoint. But when the NASDAQ did eventually reach those highs again, it would then go on to triple them over the next 6 years.Like with the Internet, it may take years if not a decade for crypto pricing to recover. But in the meantime, there are signs that cryptocurrency usage, uncorrelated from cryptocurrency pricing, is continuing on or even growing. Usage that may lead to exciting new products, services, and scenarios for cryptocurrency. Usage that provides a reason for some much needed rational optimism for cryptocurrency.","tags":[],"author":"Eric Feng","creation_date":"2022-11-05"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@nodexfinance/earn-passive-income-with-nodes-46c5ed74a026","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"News Article","summary":"How to earn passive income with nodes and how NodeX helps you to do it really passively.","title":"Earn Passive Income With Nodes.","detailed_content":"How to earn passive income with nodes and how NodeX helps you to do it really passively.Node operators in the blockchain industry can earn money through various mechanisms, primarily focusing on generating passive income. This income is derived from the essential roles these nodes play in maintaining and securing blockchain networks. Here’s a detailed look at how node operators can earn passive income:Block Rewards and Transaction FeesNode operators can earn money through block rewards and transaction fees. Block rewards are given for successfully validating a new block of transactions and adding it to the blockchain. This process is central to proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms, where miners (in PoW) or validators/stakers (in PoS) compete or are chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks. Transaction fees are paid by users to have their transactions included in a block and validated by the network. These fees can vary based on network congestion and transaction complexity[1][12].Staking RewardsIn networks that utilize a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, node operators can earn staking rewards. Staking involves holding a certain amount of the network’s cryptocurrency in a wallet to support network operations, including transaction validation and network security. The staked assets essentially act as collateral that helps ensure the honesty of the node’s operations. Rewards are typically proportional to the amount staked and the duration for which it is staked[1][5].Masternode RewardsMasternodes are a special type of node that perform additional network functions beyond transaction validation, such as enabling instant transactions, participating in governance, and more. Operating a masternode usually requires a significant upfront investment in the form of a collateral deposit of the network’s cryptocurrency. This deposit, along with the node’s operational performance, earns masternode operators higher rewards compared to regular nodes or stakers[3][12].Passive Income CharacteristicsRunning a node can provide a steady stream of passive income. This is particularly attractive in the cryptocurrency industry, where other forms of investment may require more active management or entail higher risk. The passive income from nodes comes from the automated processes of validating transactions, creating blocks, and participating in the network’s consensus mechanism. However, it’s important to note that while the income can be passive, node operation may require initial setup work, ongoing maintenance, and monitoring to ensure the node remains online and functional[4][5].Factors Influencing ProfitabilityThe profitability of running a node depends on several factors, including the type of node, the specific blockchain network, the cost of hardware and electricity, and the current rewards structure of the network. For example, networks with higher transaction volumes may offer more opportunities to earn transaction fees, while networks with lucrative staking or masternode rewards can provide significant passive income streams. However, potential operators must also consider the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which can affect the value of rewards[1][10].In summary, node operators in the blockchain industry can earn passive income through block rewards, transaction fees, staking rewards, and masternode rewards. The profitability of these ventures depends on various factors, including the type of node, the network it supports, and the costs associated with running the node.NODEx gives participants access to Nodes. By combining assets NODEx ensures marekt power and invests strategically into Nodes of different projects that are operating through Node operations.Contributor Funding:Participants contribute funds to NodeX to support the project’s operations. These funds are used to acquire and maintain the necessary infrastructure for running nodes.Node Acquisition and Operation:NodeX uses the contributed funds to purchase and operate nodes within a blockchain network. This participation in the network could involve activities such as transaction validation, block creation (in the case of mining nodes), or other network functions, depending on the chosen blockchain protocol.Revenue Generation from Node Operations:The nodes operated by NodeX generate revenue as part of their normal functioning within the blockchain network. This revenue could come from various sources, such as transaction fees, block rewards (in Proof-of-Work networks), or other mechanisms depending on the specific consensus algorithm in use.Buyback and Burn Mechanism:The unique aspect of NodeX is the commitment to using the revenues generated from node operations to buy back $NODEX tokens from the market. The bought-back $NODEX tokens are then burned, meaning they are permanently removed from circulation. The burning process reduces the total supply of $NODEX tokens in existence.Token Appreciation Strategy:The buyback and burn mechanism is designed to create scarcity by reducing the supply of $NODEX tokens. According to economic principles, a decrease in the supply of a token while demand remains constant or increases could potentially lead to an appreciation in the token’s price over the long term.Long-Term Value Proposition:NodeX positions itself as a project with a long-term value proposition, suggesting that the combination of node operations, revenue generation, and token buyback and burn will contribute to the sustained appreciation of the $NODEX token.NodeX is a project that leverages contributed funds to operate nodes within a blockchain network. The unique aspect of the project is its commitment to using the generated revenues to buy back and burn its native $NODEX tokens, aiming to create long-term value and potentially contribute to the appreciation of the token’s price.Citations:\n[1] https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/blockchain-nodes/\n[2] https://bitkan.com/learn/best-nodes-for-passive-income-can-i-really-get-profits-from-them-14487\n[3] https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/masternode/how-to-earn-crypto-setting-up-your-node/\n[4] https://tradewise.community/crypto-nodes-passive-income-generating-revenue-through-cryptocurrency-participation/\n[5] https://moneymade.io/learn/article/crypto-validator-node-passive-income\n[6] https://tokentax.co/blog/passive-income-crypto\n[7] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-node-operators-how-work-shridhar-vatharkar\n[8] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d3Flnifkc4tw\n[9] https://coinpedia.org/guest-post/how-to-start-own-business-as-a-crypto-node-operator/\n[10] https://tradewise.community/what-crypto-nodes-are-profitable-identifying-lucrative-opportunities-in-cryptocurrency-node-operation/\n[11] https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-node-a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-nodes\n[12] https://www.okx.com/learn/crypto-passive-income","tags":["Crypto","Cryptocurrency","Investing","Passive Income","Blockchain"],"author":"NodeX","creation_date":"2024-02-01"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@Realitymeta/weekly-update-1-and-glimse-of-the-future-plans-291824c18052","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Hello, dear community!","title":"Weekly Update #1 and Glimse of the Future Plans","detailed_content":"Hello, dear community!To enhance our communication, we’ve decided to start weekly updates on the Reality Metaverse ecosystem. This is our inaugural edition, and I would love to hear your feedback. What would you like to see in future updates? In this edition, I’ll cover some recent milestones, delve into our latest development updates, discuss some challenges we’re facing, and share our outlook for the future.I’m thrilled to announce that the Weather Challenge Staking has reached 100% completion! We are now gearing up for the Genesis Event, initially planned for May 13th, but now rescheduled to May 15th.We’ve also set up a brand-new Twitter account specifically for this initiative. Feel free to follow us here for real-time updates.Additionally, our Hold to Earn event has been the talk of the community. While it’s currently active, we may need to adjust the rewards based on its performance. This event has been a valuable learning experience, teaching us important lessons for future planning.As highlighted in yesterday’s article, the Hold to Earn event has been a mix of popularity and controversy. While I won’t rehash the specifics that didn’t go as planned, rest assured, we’ve learned valuable lessons from this experience.On the $RMV token front, we recognize the current market trends aren’t favorable. Our chart isn’t looking as strong as we’d like, and we’re actively working on strategies to improve this for potential future investors. However, it’s important to remember that we’re committed to thoughtful progress, not rushed solutions. The market determines the value of our project; our role is to enhance our offerings through targeted marketing, new listings, strategic collaborations, and engaging events like the Weather Challenge Genesis Mint.Feedback from our community indicates that Landlord GO is experiencing gameplay challenges. Though this game is managed by Reality Games and not directly by us, we are planning strategic initiatives with our sister company to enhance user acquisition and restore the engaging gameplay that appeals to a broad audience, not just a niche.In terms of overall development, we recognize that progress may seem slow. We are tackling many projects, and despite market noise and some delays, major development sprints are nearing completion. Our focus is steadfast: to build and innovate continuously. We are excited about the upcoming announcement of an AAA game, which we believe will elevate our project to new heights. I am profoundly grateful for our community’s loyalty and patience, understanding that achieving greatness takes time.As we near the completion of our current projects related to the marketplace and the Reality NFT portal, we are excited to share what lies ahead. Next week, I plan to unveil a detailed multi-year roadmap for the Reality Metaverse, but let me give you a sneak peek into one of our daring upcoming initiatives:$RMV Reduction: By reducing the circulating supply of $RMV, we aim to stabilize and potentially increase its value. The tokens removed from circulation will not only help fund further development and marketing but also adjust the balance of rewards across royalties, events, staking, and Genesis collections.Value Recompensation: Although $RMV will be deducted, stakers will receive monthly NFTs whose value exceeds the lost tokens. Additionally, stakers will earn $TRUMPET coins at a higher rate relative to their staked $RMV, along with other perks like potential spots on the Genesis whitelist.Example Staking Scenario: (Note: Actual figures may vary)Your initial investment of 10,000 $RMV could yield:If the staking took 6 months, you would end up with 6 x NFTs airdrops, 7000 of $RMV, and $TRUMPET at a very high APR + $RMV worth of 4500 in $TRUMPET coin.We believe this innovative approach will propel our ecosystem forward, but your feedback is crucial. Let me know your thoughts before this goes live — we value your input and want to ensure our community is on board with these bold moves.As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the utility of $RMV, we are introducing flexible and time-specific staking options. These options are designed not only to reward our community members but also to strategically manage the supply of $RMV over time. Here’s how it works:Stakers can choose from several fixed periods for locking in their $RMV:Each period offers a unique staking APR, which is set to decrease as more users participate. This tiered approach ensures that early stakers benefit from higher APRs, encouraging prompt participation. Here’s an illustrative example of how APRs will adjust based on $RMV price targets (note: actual APRs will differ, and do not worry, they will not be that high):Until $RMV reaches $0.04:Until $RMV reaches $0.07:Until $RMV reaches $0.10:This structured reduction in APRs is designed to align with our strategic goals of sustaining long-term value and demand for $RMV, by adjusting the rewards as the token appreciates. This approach not only helps in managing the economic model of $RMV but also provides clarity and predictability for our stakers.While a detailed article on Genesis NFTs is scheduled for tomorrow, I’d like to give you a brief preview today. Currently, these NFTs are significantly undervalued, and we are committed to elevating their floor price to much higher levels in the near future.Utilities of Genesis NFTs:Stay tuned for the comprehensive details in tomorrow’s article, and prepare for an exciting journey with Genesis NFTs!A quick snapshot of the upcoming Weather Challenge Genesis NFT:As we look to the future of the Reality Metaverse, our plans are not only ambitious but designed to significantly enhance user engagement and expand our ecosystem. Here are the key initiatives we plan to implement:These mid-term initiatives are designed to propel our growth and ensure that we continue to provide a dynamic and enriching environment for our community.As we look further into the future, our plans for the Reality Metaverse become even more visionary and expansive. Here’s what we plan to implement in the long term:These long-term initiatives are designed not just to expand the Reality Metaverse but to fundamentally transform how users interact with digital and real-world environments, leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a truly immersive experience.I hope you found this detailed article insightful. Your questions and feedback are invaluable to us, so please don’t hesitate to reach out. Next week, I’ll be prepared to address your inquiries and share insights directly with everyone. This update was a bit longer than usual, but it was important to provide you with a comprehensive glimpse into our future plans. Stay tuned for next week’s edition, where we will unveil the much-anticipated roadmap for the Reality Metaverse. Your continued support and engagement are what drive us forward!","tags":["Blockchain","Gamefi","Nft","Token","Metaverse"],"author":"Reality Metaverse NFT"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@vanflymen/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The fastest way to learn how Blockchains work is to build one","title":"Learn Blockchains by Building One","detailed_content":"You’re here because, like me, you’re psyched about the rise of Cryptocurrencies. And you want to know how Blockchains work—the fundamental technology behind them.But understanding Blockchains isn’t easy—or at least wasn’t for me. I trudged through dense videos, followed porous tutorials, and dealt with the amplified frustration of too few examples.I like learning by doing. It forces me to deal with the subject matter at a code level, which gets it sticking. If you do the same, at the end of this guide you’ll have a functioning Blockchain with a solid grasp of how they work.Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that they’re chained together using hashes.If you aren’t sure what a hash is, here’s an explanation.Who is this guide aimed at? You should be comfy reading and writing some basic Python, as well as have some understanding of how HTTP requests work, since we’ll be talking to our Blockchain over HTTP.What do I need? Make sure that Python 3.6+ (along with pip) is installed. You’ll also need to install Flask and the wonderful Requests library:Oh, you’ll also need an HTTP Client, like Postman or cURL. But anything will do.Where’s the final code? The source code is available here.Open up your favourite text editor or IDE, personally I ❤️ PyCharm. Create a new file, called blockchain.py. We’ll only use a single file, but if you get lost, you can always refer to the source code.We’ll create a Blockchain class whose constructor creates an initial empty list (to store our blockchain), and another to store transactions. Here’s the blueprint for our class:Our Blockchain class is responsible for managing the chain. It will store transactions and have some helper methods for adding new blocks to the chain. Let’s start fleshing out some methods.Each Block has an index, a timestamp (in Unix time), a list of transactions, a proof (more on that later), and the hash of the previous Block.Here’s an example of what a single Block looks like:At this point, the idea of a chain should be apparent—each new block contains within itself, the hash of the previous Block. This is crucial because it’s what gives blockchains immutability: If an attacker corrupted an earlier Block in the chain then all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.Does this make sense? If it doesn’t, take some time to let it sink in—it’s the core idea behind blockchains.We’ll need a way of adding transactions to a Block. Our new_transaction() method is responsible for this, and it’s pretty straight-forward:After new_transaction() adds a transaction to the list, it returns the index of the block which the transaction will be added to—the next one to be mined. This will be useful later on, to the user submitting the transaction.When our Blockchain is instantiated we’ll need to seed it with a genesis block—a block with no predecessors. We’ll also need to add a “proof” to our genesis block which is the result of mining (or proof of work). We’ll talk more about mining later.In addition to creating the genesis block in our constructor, we’ll also flesh out the methods for new_block(), new_transaction() and hash():The above should be straight-forward—I’ve added some comments and docstrings to help keep it clear. We’re almost done with representing our blockchain. But at this point, you must be wondering how new blocks are created, forged or mined.A Proof of Work algorithm (PoW) is how new Blocks are created or mined on the blockchain. The goal of PoW is to discover a number which solves a problem. The number must be difficult to find but easy to verify—computationally speaking—by anyone on the network. This is the core idea behind Proof of Work.We’ll look at a very simple example to help this sink in.Let’s decide that the hash of some integer x multiplied by another y must end in 0. So, hash(x * y) \u003d ac23dc...0. And for this simplified example, let’s fix x \u003d 5. Implementing this in Python:The solution here is y \u003d 21. Since, the produced hash ends in 0:In Bitcoin, the Proof of Work algorithm is called Hashcash. And it’s not too different from our basic example above. It’s the algorithm that miners race to solve in order to create a new block. In general, the difficulty is determined by the number of characters searched for in a string. The miners are then rewarded for their solution by receiving a coin—in a transaction.The network is able to easily verify their solution.Let’s implement a similar algorithm for our blockchain. Our rule will be similar to the example above:To adjust the difficulty of the algorithm, we could modify the number of leading zeroes. But 4 is sufficient. You’ll find out that the addition of a single leading zero makes a mammoth difference to the time required to find a solution.Our class is almost complete and we’re ready to begin interacting with it using HTTP requests.We’re going to use the Python Flask Framework. It’s a micro-framework and it makes it easy to map endpoints to Python functions. This allows us talk to our blockchain over the web using HTTP requests.We’ll create three methods:Our “server” will form a single node in our blockchain network. Let’s create some boilerplate code:A brief explanation of what we’ve added above:This is what the request for a transaction will look like. It’s what the user sends to the server:Since we already have our class method for adding transactions to a block, the rest is easy. Let’s write the function for adding transactions:Our mining endpoint is where the magic happens, and it’s easy. It has to do three things:Note that the recipient of the mined block is the address of our node. And most of what we’ve done here is just interact with the methods on our Blockchain class. At this point, we’re done, and can start interacting with our blockchain.You can use plain old cURL or Postman to interact with our API over a network.Fire up the server:Let’s try mining a block by making a GET request to http://localhost:5000/mine:Let’s create a new transaction by making a POST request tohttp://localhost:5000/transactions/new with a body containing our transaction structure:If you aren’t using Postman, then you can make the equivalent request using cURL:I restarted my server, and mined two blocks, to give 3 in total. Let’s inspect the full chain by requesting http://localhost:5000/chain:This is very cool. We’ve got a basic Blockchain that accepts transactions and allows us to mine new Blocks. But the whole point of Blockchains is that they should be decentralized. And if they’re decentralized, how on earth do we ensure that they all reflect the same chain? This is called the problem of Consensus, and we’ll have to implement a Consensus Algorithm if we want more than one node in our network.Before we can implement a Consensus Algorithm, we need a way to let a node know about neighbouring nodes on the network. Each node on our network should keep a registry of other nodes on the network. Thus, we’ll need some more endpoints:We’ll need to modify our Blockchain’s constructor and provide a method for registering nodes:Note that we’ve used a set() to hold the list of nodes. This is a cheap way of ensuring that the addition of new nodes is idempotent—meaning that no matter how many times we add a specific node, it appears exactly once.As mentioned, a conflict is when one node has a different chain to another node. To resolve this, we’ll make the rule that the longest valid chain is authoritative. In other words, the longest chain on the network is the de-facto one. Using this algorithm, we reach Consensus amongst the nodes in our network.The first method valid_chain() is responsible for checking if a chain is valid by looping through each block and verifying both the hash and the proof.resolve_conflicts() is a method which loops through all our neighbouring nodes, downloads their chains and verifies them using the above method. If a valid chain is found, whose length is greater than ours, we replace ours.Let’s register the two endpoints to our API, one for adding neighbouring nodes and the another for resolving conflicts:At this point you can grab a different machine if you like, and spin up different nodes on your network. Or spin up processes using different ports on the same machine. I spun up another node on my machine, on a different port, and registered it with my current node. Thus, I have two nodes: http://localhost:5000 and http://localhost:5001.I then mined some new Blocks on node 2, to ensure the chain was longer. Afterward, I called GET /nodes/resolve on node 1, where the chain was replaced by the Consensus Algorithm:And that’s a wrap... Go get some friends together to help test out your Blockchain.I hope that this has inspired you to create something new. I’m ecstatic about Cryptocurrencies because I believe that Blockchains will rapidly change the way we think about economies, governments and record-keeping.Update: I’m planning on following up with a Part 2, where we’ll extend our Blockchain to have a Transaction Validation Mechanism as well as discuss some ways in which you can productionize your Blockchain.","tags":["Blockchain","Cryptocurrency","Bitcoin","Python","Software Engineering"],"author":"Daniel van Flymen","creation_date":"2017-09-25"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/quadrans/quadrans-and-truebit-revolutionizing-textile-industry-3aecd7a74a86","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The Project","title":"Quadrans and Truebit revolutionizing Textile industry","detailed_content":"The TRICK project, supported by the EU’s Horizon 2020 program, aims to promote sustainable practices in Europe’s textile, clothing, and food industries through a digital platform.Within the architecture of the TRICK platform, the Quadrans Foundation with the continued support of Truebit Team has developed a unique tool to enable verified textile traceability information to be provided to the end consumer.Quadrans, with its global accessibility, emerged to serve the intricate needs of industries and supply chains. It offers automated processes through traceability and smart contracts, thereby lowering costs and bolstering security and enables seamless collaboration and cross-border transactions.Quadrans is an open-source Blockchain ecosystem derived from Ethereum, retaining elements like the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The platform has evolved to integrate unique features while maintaining interoperability with Ethereum, supporting seamless transitions of existing solutions. Looking ahead, Quadrans plans to implement a hybrid consensus protocol combining Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to enhance security and efficiency.For those reasons Quadrans was chosen by the TRICK consortium as the reference public blockchain and data plane where information regarding production processes to consumers and stakeholders can be saved.The Identity-Manager Smart Contract provides a decentralized mechanism on the blockchain for managing and verifying the associations between user identifiers and their corresponding public addresses. It supports functions like adding or editing identities and retrieving associated public addresses or user IDs. It ensures controlled access by allowing only a designated IdentityManager address to modify identities, enhancing decentralization by eliminating reliance on a centralized database for storing these associations.The Portability Smart-Contract on the public layer stores all public documents for each instance of the portability process. The smart contract is designed to allow write access solely to its owner, enhancing security by ensuring that only the owner can add data, and upon completion, ownership can be relinquished to a null address to seal the data permanently. This design prevents unauthorized data alteration even if the private key is compromised. In brief, the smart contract can handle the following data:Data portability empowers users by allowing them to transfer their data across various services or platforms, thereby avoiding vendor lock-in and enhancing competition among providers. This flexibility is especially important in the blockchain ecosystem, where it supports the interoperability of decentralized applications and aids in operational efficiency and disaster recovery. A number of alternative solutions were examined before implementing portability on blockchain via Truebit:The Quadrans Team has developed a key component called the Verifier Agent that allows the authenticity and integrity of data to be verified before it is published on Portability Smart-Contract.In the TRICK Project, the NFTs represent individual products, enhancing their authenticity, traceability, and security by embedding a uniqueProductID that links back to centralized systems. Additionally, each NFT has a meta-data file stored on IPFS, detailing the product’s attributes and ensuring transparency.The activity of testing and adapting the product to real business needs is ongoing. Pilot projects are currently being conducted by major textile companies such as Fratelli Piacenza S.p.A and the Customs and Monopolies Agency, among others. The expectation is to release the first apparel samples associated with Quadrans NFT by the end of 2024.Stay tuned","tags":["Blockchain","Fashion","Smart Contracts","Quantum","Cryptocurrency"],"author":"Davide Costa"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@2shabby/monad-pioneering-the-next-frontier-of-blockchain-evolution-8fdef3fedaa4","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"In the dynamic world of blockchain technology, innovation is the key to success.

I sat down to write this article and instead found myself generating random Chihuahua images until I got “the one.” It involved a lot of trial and errors, and I got to a point where I could start to understand how the AI model worked under the hood, and what prompt works the best for my purpose.Similarly, building MEV bots is also enjoyable, and it also involves grinding and understanding why our bot works or doesn’t. But it’s slightly different from AI, because we can actually lose money while we’re testing our strategies. This is why we should analyze our competitive edge very carefully and test everything out before we start running our system.Today, we are going to continue from where we left off last week:We had built a system that could detect sandwich opportunities from Uniswap V2 forked DEXs. And we would like to see if we can really profit from sending bundles on-chain.For readers that haven’t read through the code yet, here’s the code:Before we get started though, I’ll ruin the fun for you a little bit, and mention that this system isn’t profitable yet. But it can be.Over the next few weeks, we’ll take a deeper look at the system and try to add more optimizations to the code so that it’ll become more competitive.Integrating these additional features will significantly increase the likelihood of the system succeeding in real trades.However, it’s important to note that this exercise shouldn’t be viewed as a shortcut to profiting in the MEV market, as there truly isn’t one. By the time you’ve successfully implemented all the features and stayed with me until the end, you’ll realize the considerable effort required to transform your system into a winning one.I hope that these open-sourced guides can assist individuals in comprehending the nature of MEV, aiding them in uncovering genuine opportunities in the market.Before we move on, I’d like to mention one thing.There’s a question I constantly get from a lot of people:And I never really give them a straight-forward answer, because the system can be profitable in the hands of someone who understands the system very well, and at the same time be useless in another’s.There’s a character I used to like very much in One Piece, Robe Lucci.For those of you that aren’t familiar. Robe Lucci trained his body to become a weapon itself. And his skill, Shigan 👉, is capable of lethally striking an armed man with his index finger alone.Likewise, I believe that all our systems can become like Shigan. It will become competitive if you understand the core logic very well. But it’s just a fragile finger if you don’t train yourself for it.We’ll be going through some interesting topics in today’s article.And if you ever get stuck anywhere, please feel free to reach out and ask others if they’re experiencing similar issues from the Discord server 🙏:Let’s get started! 🏎To see if we have a chance at winning real sandwich trades, we’ll start running our code from where we left off in the previous article.The snapshot of the code is on a different branch of the Github repository, you can go to phase1 branch for this:Try running the code by doing:The program will update new pools and tokens that were launched on Uniswap V2 since our last run, and start monitoring for sandwich opportunities.We let it run for a while 😴.And we detect our first sandwich after 5 blocks:We can see that the transaction of the victim is as follows:0xd1a41244a9aab38f41ce5fb54ce5ba3bcd20e07afb439bc968b720f5031feb80It’s a transaction that is making a trade using the Universal Router.The optimized token in amount was 2.0 WETH, and we could expect to earn a profit of 0.0516 WETH from the sandwich bundle.However, this is only if we don’t consider gas costs. We are using:and the base fee is at 22.27 gwei, so our total gas costs end up being within the range of:0.00475 ~ 0.00498 ETHThere can be a slight difference on the gas costs, because of gas refunds and how foundry-evm calculates this, so we’ll go with the value we get from our simulation engine, which is 0.00475 ETH.Then our revenue is expected to be:Let’s see if our sandwich bundle is competitive.Using Gambit Labs’ Auction Stats service, we can figure out how many people were submitting bundles to capture this opportunitiy, and see how much bribe they are sending to builders.Paste in the transaction hash from Auction Stats tab and let’s see how competitive we were:You can see that there are a lot of fellow searchers trying to capture the same opportunity:The top briber on Gambit Labs was using 0.058102 ETH as the bribe. And our revenue after factoring in gas costs is 0.0469 ETH, so we can see that we need to optimize our contract a little more to win.This time, let’s go to Eigenphi and see which searcher actually won this trade:And the winner is Jared. No surprises there, but we’d like to know how he did it.His frontrunning transaction looks like this:and his backrunning transaction like this:First, we check if our optimizations were done correctly. And it does seem like it is:Jared got a value of 2 something WETH as the optimized amount in value as well.However, this is the part where you’ll start to get confused. You’ll see that Jared has other trades in his frontrun and backrun transactions. And because of this, he is able to generate more profits compared to other sandwich bots.The revenue we could have expected is:0.0469 ETH * $2,300 (current ETH price) \u003d $107.87wherease Jared is able to generate $160.This is because Jared is also doing arbitrage in his frontrun / backrun transactions.Let’s briefly take a look at what he’s doing in the frontrunning transaction:You can see that Jared is doing a 2-hop arbitrage between Uniswap V3 and V2. He was able to spot an arbitrage opportunity on dogwifhat pools in the two DEXs and add that in his frontrun transaction.How do we know that this is an arbitrage opportunity?Because Jared is trading on two pools:they are both paired up with:Well, that’s a bummer…because we can never win Jared now unless we implement arbitrage in our system as well.No need to get disappointed just yet, because it’ll only get worse once you see how he’s exiting out of his initial RSTK tokens (what the victim was trying to trade on Universal Router).His backrun transactions are quite complex as well. But it’s a combination of sandwich and arbitrage just like the frontrunning transaction.Now, that’s strange. I thought we only needed to exit out of the RSTK position using the initial Uniswap V2 pool, right?Not really, because if you think about it, there can be price differences on any different pools paired up with the same tokens, that means that an arbitrage opportunity might exist among these pools.And that’s exactly what Jared is doing. Jared’s bot detects a price discrepancy between Uniswap V3 and V2 RSTK pools and performs an arbitrage and get’s an extra profit out of it.With this, he is able to earn at least $50 more on the same opportunity that we spotted.📍 There’s so much more to learn from Jared actually. He is also doing:\n1. JIT liquidity provisioning in his frontrunning transactions, 2. picks up multiple victim transactions to sandwich them, 3. buys memecoins and performs non-WETH sandwich strategies using these tokens. But these are for after we’ve mastered the art of simple sandwich + arbitrage strategies.I hope that this can give you an idea of how competitive you have to be to win in the Ethereum sandwich market nowadays.Let’s try running our sandwich bot a bit longer:We can see that we’re seeing sandwich opportunities every few blocks. And I hope you can try doing the same and run comparisons on:This will give you a very clear idea about how much more we have to optimize our code.In this section, we’re finally going to try and send some real bundles to builder endpoints. As you have seen in the previous section though, our sandwich bundle will not be competitive yet, so don’t expect you’ll land bundles until we’ve optimized the code a bit more.We’ll still see how we can broadcast our bundles to multiple builders and see for ourselves how competitive this basic strategy is from Gambit Labs. We’ll look at:The first step to take before we submit our bundles is to deploy our smart contract on the mainnet. We’ll be using Foundry for this.Before we really deploy the given contract here:We’ll quickly run some tests and see if all the functions work as intended.👉 First, let’s see if we can send ETH and ERC-20 tokens to our contract and recover them back. One mistake I made when I was first starting out was forgetting to add this function and I had to look at my ETH get locked up in the contract. Hopefully we know that this won’t happen with the Sandooo contract.Start an Anvil process by doing:I’ll start a fork of the mainnet and run Anvil on port 2000.Next, write the test function for the contract as follows in sandooo/contracts/test/Sandooo.t.sol:and run:and check the logs we get:You can see that we can safely recover our funds after we’ve sent them to our contract.👉 Next, we’ll try to make a simulated swap on a Uniswap V2 pair and confirm that our contract indeed works.Try adding this to the test function we wrote earlier:We’ll try to buy some USDT using WETH.Try running the test with the command:and we’ll get:We can see that the test succeeds.Now that we’ve tested out our contracts and have seen that all our functions work well, we can deploy to mainnet.Luckily, this contract is very simple, so the compiled bytecode amounts to this: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’s very short, don’t you think?I tried deploying this on mainnet using the command:and I used 181,016 in gas, and at:used 0.00246 ETH to deploy the contract. That’s $5.67.Try pulling from Github and you’ll now see that the phase2 branch has been merged to our main branch.And there’s the execution.rs file in sandooo/src directory:If you’re planning to test this out, please double check all the logic and take care! There’re so many ways a contract deployment can go wrong, I always take extra steps to ensure I’m not missing anything. (🛑 Also, don’t trust what I tell you in this article, confirm the logic yourself before you can try things on the mainnet. As a matter of fact, don’t trust anyone 🛑)Change the DEBUG field in .env file so that the code can run using real WETH in the contract:Make sure to add the real BOT_ADDRESS and PRIVATE_KEY of the address that was used to deploy the bot contract.I tried sending 0.5 WETH to the contract to test out my logic.With this, we can try running our bot:Now we wait, and pray everything goes well. 🙏I ended up sending one bundle 8 blocks after I started the system.We want to focus on the “Bundle sent” part of our log this time:We see that we’ve successfully sent to Gambit Labs, Flashbots, Rsync, Penguin Build, Titan Builder, Builder0x69, and Beaverbuild.We are interested in Gambit Labs, so let’s head over to their website and check out the transaction hash and see what the competition is like:0x1924235bfe061560fd9725320cf4c26825422ea1aff42ec913a76e53370d7199This is the victim’s transaction hash:You can checkout the auction status here, and our bundle is at the bottom of the competition:Compare our bribe amount to the top bidder who paid 0.009547 ETH as bribe. The top bidder is paying twice as much as we are.To see why this may be the case. Head on over to Eigenphi this time and see what the optimized amount in value was. Our value 0.39728 WETH.But our simulation is still fast enough as you can see from here:Our bundle is being sent well within a second and so we can conclude that network latency isn’t the issue here. We’ll look at what the winning searcher was doing.This is the same as what Jared got:but definitely not enough to compete with his massive sandwich, that looks like this:So, we’re definitely getting somewhere, but we certainly do need to find a way to improve our bot’s performance. Don’t worry, we will. Our system is only doing Uniswap V2 sandwiches right now, and we can only handle single sandwich per bundle, so if we were already earning profits, then the market will be very boring.In the following 2 ~ 3 articles, we’ll try to optimize this system as much as we can by adding:and see if we can compete with this system.Hint: We still can’t. 🤣 But we’ll get very very close. And I’ll give you some tips on how you can win in this type of market.If you found this article interesting and would like to keep following the progress, follow me on Twitter! https://twitter.com/solidquant","tags":["Mev","Sandwich","Cryptocurrency","Blockchain","Programming"],"author":"Solid Quant","creation_date":"2024-02-04"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@shelterofexiles/shelter-of-exiles-airdrop-starting-get-the-power-of-soex-a-treasure-hunt-airdrop-1fe339d4eb82","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Join us on an extraordinary journey with Shelter of Exiles during our special Airdrop Campaign, Get the Power of $SOEX: A Treasure Hunt…","title":"Shelter of Exiles’ Airdrop Starting!

I ignored the Monday Night Football game on TV and the conversation next to me about the day’s writers’ conference workshop because I was glued to a Twitter group chat called Fin’s Beach Bar and Back Patio. The person sitting next to me must have noticed how much I was snickering as I scrolled my phone. “You look like you’re having a great time,” they said. “What’s so funny?”Do I even try and explain? I wondered. “Just my friends,” I replied. I left out the part about the imaginary bar by the beach.In sociology, the term “third places” describes the places people spend time between home (“first” place) and work (“second” place). Third places are where people gather primarily for social reasons and to build relationships. For many of the 200+ people across 3 group chats, our shared memes, creations, and inside jokes make Fin’s a third place. We’ve grown into a community with a unique culture and identity and we’re ready to evolve. But before Fin’s opens it’s doors to more people, it’s a good time to reflect and share:For the most part, Twitter group chats are spam: if you can DM someone, you can add them to a group chat without them having to accept the request. The feature itself is also hard to use — there’s no search or reply context for example. Pretty quickly it became clear our chat needed a purpose — a reason to exist.Ultimately, the goal was to help connect people in the doodles’ community with each other. But meaningful connections don’t magically happen when you put people in a group chat together, so I needed something more — a structured approach that would help people come together. I set out to create an experience, based on a smart contract on the blockchain.Because the majority of the group came from the doodles community, I decided to “reward” everyone who stayed in the chat with a series of ERC1155 collectibles related to both the doodles’ universe and the bar. I announced I’d be air-dropping NFTs to people in the chat and began to collect wallet addresses. Interest grew, and before long a second group chat had formed — the line to get in to the bar.Belonging to a Fin’s chat meant acting the part — for folks in the bar, they celebrated like VIPs who skip past the velvet rope at the hottest clubs. Fictitious drink specials were announced nightly. The people in the line complained about the wait, the rain, and the lack of food options. So far, the project was an improvisational exercise and everyone seemed into it.While I was writing a smart contract to effectively govern the rules of our social game, the group was vibing and memeing. One of the earliest group efforts was editing everyone’s profile picture into a template of the doodles shark suit holding a Fin’s sign. We also temporarily adopted the phrase “IYKYK”, adding them to our tweets with a shark emoji. The template was shared between both chats and resulted in a proliferation of shark-themed profile pictures on Twitter:With help from the geniuses at West Coast NFT, I developed a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain that effectively set up the rules for the game. The contract made it possible for me to send a maximum of 150 tokens each round for ten rounds. These tokens were designed to be “burned” as a full set in order to redeem one final, ultimate token.This feels like a good time to emphasize how much it really helps to have a creative friend and partner. NFTSantana helped scheme out the possible evolutions of this project at every step of the way. He is the reason this was not all a complete flop by week 2.Because Fin’s had two group chats of 75 people, we decided to gamify the distribution of the 150 tokens in a way that rewarded trust, cooperation, and helped people make new connections. Each week, I changed the mechanics of the airdrop:Because the distribution was unpredictable but the goal of obtaining one of each had been made clear, people found trading partners, made deals, and maneuvered their collections to accumulate full sets of these collectibles. (There was even a google spreadsheet created by the community to track token trades!) I didn’t use rarity or scarcity to drive speculative value, which made it entirely possible to accumulate a full set by simply trading and participating and without spending any money (although there was a small amount of sales volume on secondary).After the first ten tokens had been issued, I designed a burn-to-redeem function that allowed people to submit a full set—exactly one of each token — in exchange for a final, ultimate token.Over the 10 weeks Fin’s was officially running, we had collaborations/partnerships with a couple of different artists in the web3 space, including:These partnerships emerged organically, they weren’t just allowlist spots. We worked with these teams to connect the creators and artists with the people in Fin’s. Some brought templates; others airdropped NFTs to everyone in the bar and line. Many weeks, we welcomed the artists as guests to the chat and got to know them and learn about their work. Check out our zipsharks collab:For a while, I considered a future where Fin’s was focused on launching and marketing projects. Would it be possible to tokenize grass-roots, organic marketing? It felt like a good idea — but this isn’t what REALLY made Fin’s a success. It was the relationships and sense of belonging that our shared purpose had helped grow and made us an effective partner. People weren’t here to participate in a coordinated marketing campaign — they were here to have fun.I made a lot of adjustments over the course of the project. For example, one early goal was to create a 3D space that people could visit in their browser or in VR. Getting the exact details right was hard, and so I had to really reduce the scope of the art. I was also tempted to lean into the early hype and considered accelerating the project’s timetable a lot.The initial concept was to “build” Fin’s in sections. Over a period of ten weeks, I’d airdrop 10 different sections as NFTs. Together, they’d assemble the full bar. This process ended up being a lot more difficult than I anticipated, because it was really hard to convey the concept of doodles-themed objects and get it done in a compressed amount of time.For example, one of the first pieces I commissioned was a single alley scene. But the more I gave feedback around color and perspective, the more the artist increased the project’s scope. I had been very clear that I wanted a single wall in an alley — but what I got was a full city block:I also attempted to build a full composite of Fin’s. And while I thought this artist was excellent at taking feedback, the scene just felt like it was missing something.I started to feel the hype kicking in. People were filling my DMs with requests to join Fin’s. We had secondary sales after the first drop, and the art was well-received. I resisted leaning into the hype for a couple of reasons:Ultimately, I built the experience into an episodic series of weekly art drops and collaborations. Having a scheduled start and end helped set clear expectations. Spacing our project over 10 weeks had an affect on our art, too: because we weren’t rushed, there was time to review and revise art with artists on a reasonable schedule and incorporate the emerging culture of the bar into some of the pieces.When I look back at the memory of eating dinner while I scrolled Fin’s group chat, I realize that while I was physically in a bar lobby I was also in Fin’s. But what made it a “third place” for so many of us?This is the closest we are to the metaverse today: it’s possible to be one place physically while making memories with friends who are scattered around every corner of the globe at that same moment.So many NFT projects never end. They raise a lot of money and make large promises about utility or other products they’ll deliver, which in turn drives the speculative value of their tokens. But Fin’s was designed as a fun, social experience with an endgame in mind — because every good story eventually comes to an end.If you’re curious about what’s next for Fin’s or would like to join us, you can get more information here:www.fins.wtf","tags":["Nft","Blockchain","Nft Collectibles","Social Media","Twitter"],"author":"deepbluesteeve","creation_date":"2022-11-18"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/gitconnected/billionaire-finance-expert-delivers-most-profound-response-to-warren-buffetts-bitcoin-scepticism-b74d585822d6","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Chamath Palihapitiya — \"I\u0027m a Warren Buffett disciple, but he\u0027s wrong about Bitcoin.\"","title":"Billionaire Finance Expert Delivers Most Profound Response to Warren Buffett\u0027s Bitcoin Scepticism…","detailed_content":"Everyone has a blind spot now and then.","tags":[],"author":"Jayden Levitt","creation_date":"2024-04-22"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/izdnhussin/why-bitcoin-dump-b12b33ed718d","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"TRENDING: Economic downturn is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, These are Factors behind the Market Downturn ..","title":"Why Bitcoin Dump?","detailed_content":"The current economic downturn is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, including global market conditions, geopolitical events, and domestic policies, these are Factors behind the Market Downturn:","tags":[],"author":"Izdnhussin"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/entrepreneur-s-handbook/the-crypto-winter-is-about-to-become-a-crypto-ice-age-9d12d71e4b10","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"As another big player collapses, trust is being eroded","title":"The Crypto Winter Is About to Become a Crypto Ice Age","detailed_content":"The crypto market has just witnessed “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”I won’t claim to fully understand the complexities of the saga involving the FTX exchange, Alameda Research and recently dethroned Crypto Golden Boy Sam…","tags":[],"author":"Stephen Moore","creation_date":"2022-11-16"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@ilaNihas/0g-setting-up-your-validator-node-48216a1886d0","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"UPDATE [April 25, 2024]: It appears that the 0g-evmos repository has been removed, making it no longer possible to set up the 0g-evmos…","title":"🌍0G: Setting Up Your Validator Node","detailed_content":"UPDATE [April 25, 2024]: It appears that the 0g-evmos repository has been removed, making it no longer possible to set up the 0g-evmos node.

In the recent…","title":"Hyperbolic Introduces Novel, Practical Solution to the Problem of Verification in Decentralized AI","detailed_content":"Trust, efficiency and verifiability are significant blockers to the widespread use of decentralized AI compute and inference. In the recent past, techniques leveraging zero-knowledge proof (zkML) or optimistic assumptions and fraud proofs (opML) have emerged as potential solutions to these problems, but each of these has drawbacks that make it economically infeasible, technically impractical or both.Today, following months of collaboration with our research partners at UC Berkeley and Columbia , Hyperbolic is proud to introduce the first practical solution to this growth blocker based on a new verification mechanism we call Proof-of-Sampling, or PoSP for short.Read the full paper hereProof of Sampling (PoSP) uses sampling techniques and game theory to ensure security and efficiency by creating a system where all participants are incentivized to act honestly. At the heart of this method is an incentive structure that rewards actors for acting honestly and penalizes those who do not. By randomly selecting and verifying transactions, PoSP reduces the computational burden on the network, making it a scalable solution for decentralized systems.Read a detailed breakdown of PosP hereHere’s how PoSP works:The same philosophy also exists in the real world. In the Swiss bus system, instead of checking every passenger’s ticket on every trip, inspectors conduct random checks. The penalty is so high that no one will try to avoid paying for the tickets.The Hyperbolic research team conducted rigorous mathematical analysis and showed that as long as the probability of challenge is higher than a certain threshold based on the parameters of the setup, this PoSP achieves what is known in game theory as a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. It’s a state where all participants in the network are incentivized to act honestly because any other strategy would be less beneficial. In other words, when the system is set up correctly, with rewards and penalties balanced against the probability of being challenged, the most rational and profitable approach for all nodes is to compute the result accurately.Building on the principles of PoSP, Hyperbolic has developed spML, an implementation of PoSP designed specifically for decentralized AI inference. SpML addresses the limitations of existing verification mechanisms, such as opML (which relies on fraud proofs) and zkML (which uses zero-knowledge proofs).OpML is theoretically secure provided there is at least one honest validator verifying the outcomes. However, the absence of an incentive mechanism to ensure the presence of such a validator renders it susceptible to undetected fraud. ZkML, on the other hand, enhances security and privacy but suffers from high computational overhead, limiting scalability and efficiency.SpML utilizes an effective method to ensure both rapid processing and high security without the computational overhead associated with zkML or the vulnerability to fraud seen in opML. With spML, the protocol enhances security by randomly challenging the outcome by another validator. The asserter is unaware of whether their results will be challenged or which validator will be selected to perform the challenge, ensuring an unbiased verification process. If their outputs match, the transaction is considered valid, and the servers are rewarded. If there’s a discrepancy, the network votes to resolve the issue, maintaining system integrity and trust.Read a detailed breakdown of spML hereSo, spML improves on opML and zkML by synthesizing their strengths and effectively addressing their weaknesses. It offers better security than opML by reducing the probability of undetected fraud, while maintaining scalability and efficiency. Compared to zkML on the other hand, spML provides a more scalable and efficient solution by reducing the computational overhead associated with zero-knowledge proofs, while still ensuring a high level of security through its sampling-based approach.By combining the best aspects of both opML and zkML, spML provides a simple, practical and effective solution for decentralized AI applications.PoSP and spML have a significant impact on decentralized AI systems. By providing scalable, secure, and efficient verification mechanisms, these solutions enable the development of decentralized AI networks that can handle large-scale operations without compromising trust or performance.One of the key applications is in decentralized AI inference, where users can be confident that the correct model is being used. This ensures that they receive high-quality, trustworthy results without relying on a single centralized entity. This technology has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields where trustworthy AI is essential, including virtual assistants, robotics, content creation, and on-chain transactions.Moreover, spML’s sampling-based approach enables the creation of decentralized AI marketplaces, where providers can offer their AI models and services in a trustless and permissionless manner. This opens up new opportunities for AI developers and researchers to monetize their work and collaborate with others in the field, driving innovation and accelerating the progress of AI technologies.In the future, the PoSP protocol has significant potential for use in various decentralized systems. As suggested in the paper, it could improve the security of blockchain layer 2 solutions by ensuring pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. The protocol is also ideally suited for Actively Validated Services (AVS), enhancing security and reliability in restaking protocols like EigenLayer or Exocore. This exploration will result in innovative applications that leverage the strengths of PoSP to create robust, scalable, and secure systems.At Hyperbolic, our mission is to make AI accessible to everyone by advancing decentralized technologies through novel solutions like PoSP and spML. We’re building secure, scalable, and efficient verification mechanisms for decentralized AI systems that will enable anyone with an idea to harness the power of AI.By creating an open-access AI ecosystem, we aim to democratize the field and unlock the untapped potential of people from all over the world. Our goal is to break down the barriers preventing many from engaging with AI technology, creating a more inclusive and collaborative approach to AI development.We’re excited about the possibilities PoSP and spML open up for the future.

Such technology in recent years is obviously that of blockchain, which has seen significant growth with its promise and potential for decentralized transaction processes and a new level of efficiency and security. It particularly impacts sectors like financial services, insurance, and supply chains. And its ability to facilitate monetary exchanges and communication between parties without the need for intermediaries is what makes it invaluable. Moreover, blockchain enhances data integrity and process transparency — qualities that are crucial in managing today’s complex supply chains characterized by pressing needs around traceability and integrity.Effective supply chain management is a major differentiator in the competitiveness game for all companies, involving intricate coordination between producers, suppliers, distributors, and government bodies. Managing these relationships requires not only innovative technology like blockchain but also a strategic approach to overcome the complexities and minimize costs effectively.The onset of COVID-19 dramatically reshaped consumer expectations and exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains. If before the pandemic, consumers enjoyed the luxury of two-hour delivery windows for a wide array of products, the new set up that the pandemic brought highlighted the critical importance of efficient supply chain systems as delays became commonplace, affecting essential and leisure products alike.The challenges extend beyond pandemic-related disruptions. Supply chains today also grapple with geopolitical tensions, cyber threats, environmental changes, and more. These factors compel companies to reevaluate their strategies, moving away from just-in-time models to more resilient approaches.According to a Deloitte report, within this new level of complexity of the markets, supply chain executives are prioritizing three key areas to enhance supply chain resilience:Blockchain technology serves as a decentralized ledger that not only enhances transparency but also secures data against tampering, making it ideal for complex supply chains where traditional trust mechanisms falter.For instance, in resource-heavy industries, blockchain facilitates detailed tracking of Scope 3 emissions, allowing companies to manage their environmental impact more effectively. Additionally, by ensuring data integrity and transparency, blockchain enhances trust among various supply chain participants, from producers to end consumers.The rapid evolution within tech demands a deep understanding of these innovations, especially their capability to handle and process data effectively. Despite extensive advancements, numerous challenges persist in supply chain management — issues such as transparency in transportation processes, supply, and information management remain largely unaddressed.Yes, blockchain’s attributes — transparency, decentralization, verifiability, and traceability — are, indeed, drawing attention. Yet, there’s a crucial need for robust tools to implement these technologies effectively across different sectors to maximize their benefits, including enhanced monitoring, auditing, and compliance capabilities.Scalability Challenges: The expansion of blockchain applications highlights the need for scalable solutions that can handle increased transaction volumes without compromising speed or security.

In this comprehensive guide, you’ll delve into the intricate world of arbitrage trading and explore the fascinating realm of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Discover the essential concepts and principles behind MEV arbitrage, gaining a deep understanding of how to exploit potential profit opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.Step-by-step, you’ll be guided through the process of building a robust trading bot, acquiring the necessary programming skills and insights. From setting up your development environment to implementing effective strategies, this tutorial covers it all. Unleash the power of automation and enhance your trading prowess as you construct a MEV Arbitrage Trading Bot that can navigate the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency markets. Elevate your understanding of blockchain technology and decentralized exchanges, empowering yourself to thrive in the evolving landscape of digital finance.A MEV (Miner Extractable Value) Bot is a specialized algorithmic trading bot designed to capitalize on opportunities within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems by exploiting miner-controlled transaction ordering. Miners have the ability to include or reorder transactions in a block, allowing them to extract additional value from the transactions. MEV Bots leverage this phenomenon by automating the identification and execution of trades that maximize profit in the context of miner behavior.These bots are crucial in navigating the dynamic and competitive landscape of DeFi markets, where optimizing transaction sequencing can lead to enhanced profitability and strategic advantages. MEV Bots are at the forefront of algorithmic trading in blockchain environments, blending financial expertise with technical sophistication.MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bots are automated programs or algorithms that exploit the opportunities for profit within the context of blockchain transactions, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments. MEV refers to the value that miners (or validators) can extract from reordering and including transactions in a block. MEV bots aim to maximize the profit potential by strategically front-running, back-running, or sandwiching transactions.Here’s a breakdown of how MEV bots work:It’s important to note that MEV and MEV bots are topics of ongoing research and discussion within the blockchain and cryptocurrency communities. Efforts are being made to mitigate the impact of MEV on decentralized systems and to develop more fair and transparent transaction ordering mechanisms.An MEV Arbitrage Bot is a sophisticated algorithmic trading program designed for decentralized finance (DeFi) environments. Leveraging Miner Extractable Value (MEV), the bot strategically exploits opportunities by analyzing and capitalizing on transaction ordering variations that can occur due to miner influence.This automated tool aims to optimize profits by identifying and executing trades in a way that maximizes gains from MEV. MEV Arbitrage Bots play a crucial role in the competitive landscape of DeFi, providing traders with a powerful means to navigate and capitalize on the dynamic nature of blockchain transactions.MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bot strategies encompass a variety of techniques and approaches to exploit profit opportunities within blockchain transactions, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Here are some common types of MEV bot strategies:》 Front-Running:MEV bots observe pending transactions and quickly submit their own transactions with higher gas fees to get executed before the original transactions. This strategy is often employed to take advantage of anticipated price movements caused by the initial transaction.》 Back-Running:In contrast to front-running, back-running involves submitting a transaction after a known transaction has been submitted but before it is confirmed. MEV bots may exploit situations where they anticipate a market movement caused by the original transaction.》 Sandwich Attacks:Sandwich attacks involve placing two transactions around a target transaction to maximize profit. MEV bots submit a transaction before and after the target transaction, taking advantage of price movements caused by the target transaction.》 Arbitrage Opportunities:MEV bots identify and exploit price differences between different decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, or markets. They execute trades quickly to capture the price discrepancy before it normalizes.》 Flash Loans:MEV bots use flash loans to borrow a large sum of assets and perform a series of transactions within the same transaction block. This strategy allows them to exploit market inefficiencies and repay the loan in the same block.》 Smart Contract Manipulation:MEV bots interact with smart contracts in ways that allow them to extract additional value. This may involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the contract code, manipulating the order of execution, or taking advantage of conditional statements within smart contracts.》 Transaction Insertion:MEV bots may insert their own transactions into the pending transaction pool, strategically positioning them to take advantage of market movements. This can involve predicting the outcome of certain transactions and opportunistically inserting their own to capitalize on the market impact.》 Liquidation Sniping:MEV bots monitor and exploit opportunities to liquidate positions in decentralized lending and borrowing platforms. They can quickly trigger liquidation events by submitting transactions at the right moment to profit from the resulting price movements.》 Oracle Exploitation:MEV bots may target decentralized applications relying on external data or oracles. By manipulating the timing of transactions based on oracle updates, they can exploit discrepancies and gain advantages in trading or other financial activities.It’s important to note that the landscape of MEV bot strategies is dynamic, and new approaches may emerge as blockchain technology evolves. Additionally, the development of countermeasures and improved transaction ordering mechanisms is an ongoing area of research within the blockchain community.The features of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bots are characterized by their capabilities to identify, exploit, and maximize profit opportunities within blockchain transactions, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments. Here are key features associated with MEV bots:⇏ Transaction Monitoring:● MEV bots continuously monitor the mempool (the pool of pending transactions) to identify potential opportunities for profit. They analyze incoming transactions to determine which ones can be strategically exploited.⇏ Real-Time Decision-Making:● MEV bots operate in real-time, making rapid decisions based on the constantly changing conditions of the blockchain network. This allows them to quickly respond to market movements and execute transactions within the same block.⇏ Gas Fee Optimization:● MEV bots are programmed to optimize gas fees, submitting transactions with higher fees to increase the likelihood of being included in the next block. This is crucial for front-running and other time-sensitive strategies.⇏ Front-Running Capability:● Front-running is a key feature of MEV bot development, enabling them to place transactions ahead of others in the queue to take advantage of anticipated market movements and secure more favorable prices.⇏ Back-Running Capability:● MEV bots can also engage in back-running, submitting transactions after a known transaction but before it is confirmed. This strategy allows them to profit from predicted market reactions.⇏ Sandwich Attack Execution:● MEV bots are capable of executing sandwich attacks by strategically placing buy and sell transactions around a target transaction. This tactic aims to capitalize on price movements caused by the target transaction.⇏ Arbitrage Execution:● MEV bots identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities by quickly executing trades to capitalize on price differences across different decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, or markets.⇏ Flash Loan Utilization:● Some MEV bots utilize flash loans, enabling them to borrow and repay a large sum of assets within the same transaction. This strategy allows for the execution of complex trades and arbitrage opportunities without the need for substantial capital.⇏ Smart Contract Interaction:● MEV bots interact with smart contracts, exploiting vulnerabilities or manipulating the order of execution to extract additional value. This may involve taking advantage of specific conditions within smart contracts.⇏ Adaptability to Network Conditions:● MEV bots are designed to adapt to varying network conditions, adjusting their strategies based on factors such as gas prices, network congestion, and the overall market environment.⇏ Efficient Use of Blockchain Data:● MEV bots efficiently analyze and utilize blockchain data to make informed decisions. This involves tracking transaction histories, market prices, and other relevant information to optimize their strategies.It’s worth noting that MEV bot strategies and features may evolve over time as new developments in blockchain technology and DeFi ecosystems emerge. Additionally, efforts are being made to develop mechanisms to mitigate the impact of MEV on decentralized systems and promote fairness within blockchain transactions.While Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bots have been a subject of controversy due to their potential for manipulating decentralized systems, it’s important to acknowledge that the development of MEV bots comes with certain perceived benefits for users and developers. However, it’s crucial to consider these benefits in the context of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem:It’s important to note that while these potential benefits exist, MEV and MEV bots have raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community. Issues such as unfair advantages, the potential for market manipulation, and the negative impact on the decentralization ethos of blockchain networks are among the challenges associated with MEV.Developers, regulators, and the community continue to explore ways to address these concerns and promote a fair and transparent environment within blockchain ecosystems.

The software I’ve written has been used by millions of users, hundreds of developers, and the talks I’ve given have led directly to the creation of several startups. I’ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.From the start, I’ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. So don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. I’ve said this in interviews, on stage at conferences, and over email. So have other well known developers like Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked “systemically important institutions” and “too big to fail” has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there’s no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.Think about it. If you had never heard about Bitcoin before, would you care about a payments network that:I’m going to hazard a guess that the answer is no.In case you haven’t been keeping up with Bitcoin, here is how the network looks as of January 2016.The block chain is full. You may wonder how it is possible for what is essentially a series of files to be “full”. The answer is that an entirely artificial capacity cap of one megabyte per block, put in place as a temporary kludge a long time ago, has not been removed and as a result the network’s capacity is now almost completely exhausted.Here’s a graph of block sizes.The peak level in July was reached during a denial-of-service attack in which someone flooded the network with transactions in an attempt to break things, calling it a “stress test”. So that level, about 700 kilobytes of transactions (or less than 3 payments per second), is probably about the limit of what Bitcoin can actually achieve in practiceThe reason the true limit seems to be 700 kilobytes instead of the theoretical 1000 is that sometimes miners produce blocks smaller than allowed and even empty blocks, despite that there are lots of transactions waiting to confirm — this seems to be most frequently caused by interference from the Chinese “Great Firewall” censorship system. More on that in a second.If you look closely, you can see that traffic has been growing since the end of the 2015 summer months. This is expected. I wrote about Bitcoin’s seasonal growth patterns back in March.Here’s weekly average block sizes:So the average is nearly at the peak of what can be done. Not surprisingly then, there are frequent periods in which Bitcoin can’t keep up with the transaction load being placed upon it and almost all blocks are the maximum size, even when there is a long queue of transactions waiting. You can see this in the size column (the 750kb blocks come from miners that haven’t properly adjusted their software):When networks run out of capacity, they get really unreliable. That’s why so many online attacks are based around simply flooding a target computer with traffic. Sure enough, just before Christmas payments started to become unreliable and at peak times backlogs are now becoming common.Quoting a news post by ProHashing, a Bitcoin-using business:ProHashing encountered another near-miss between Christmas and New Year, this time because a payment from an exchange to their wallet was delayed.Bitcoin is supposed to respond to this situation with automatic fee rises to try and get rid of some users, and although the mechanisms behind it are barely functional that’s still sort of happening: it is rapidly becoming more and more expensive to use the Bitcoin network. Once upon a time, Bitcoin had the killer advantage of low and even zero fees, but it’s now common to be asked to pay more to miners than a credit card would charge.Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.Why are they not allowing it to grow? Several reasons. One is that the developers of the “Bitcoin Core” software that they run have refused to implement the necessary changes. Another is that the miners refuse to switch to any competing product, as they perceive doing so as “disloyalty” —and they’re terrified of doing anything that might make the news as a “split” and cause investor panic. They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.And the final reason is that the Chinese internet is so broken by their government’s firewall that moving data across the border barely works at all, with speeds routinely worse than what mobile phones provide. Imagine an entire country connected to the rest of the world by cheap hotel wifi, and you’ve got the picture. Right now, the Chinese miners are able to — just about — maintain their connection to the global internet and claim the 25 BTC reward ($11,000) that each block they create gives them. But if the Bitcoin network got more popular, they fear taking part would get too difficult and they’d lose their income stream. This gives them a perverse financial incentive to actually try and stop Bitcoin becoming popular.Many Bitcoin users and observers have been assuming up until very recently that somehow these problems would all sort themselves out, and of course the block chain size limit would be raised. After all, why would the Bitcoin community … the community that has championed the block chain as the future of finance … deliberately kill itself by strangling the chain in its crib? But that’s exactly what is happening.The resulting civil war has seen Coinbase — the largest and best known Bitcoin startup in the USA — be erased from the official Bitcoin website for picking the “wrong” side and banned from the community forums. When parts of the community are viciously turning on the people that have introduced millions of users to the currency, you know things have got really crazy.If you haven’t heard much about this, you aren’t alone. One of the most disturbing things that took place over the course of 2015 is that the flow of information to investors and users has dried up.In the span of only about eight months, Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners. This transformation is by far the most appalling thing I have ever seen, and the result is that I no longer feel comfortable being associated with the Bitcoin community.Bitcoin is not intended to be an investment and has always been advertised pretty accurately: as an experimental currency which you shouldn’t buy more of than you can afford to lose. It is complex, but that never worried me because all the information an investor might want was out there, and there’s an entire cottage industry of books, conferences, videos and websites to help people make sense of it all.That has now changed.Most people who own Bitcoin learn about it through the mainstream media. Whenever a story goes mainstream the Bitcoin price goes crazy, then the media report on the price rises and a bubble happens.Stories about Bitcoin reach newspapers and magazines through a simple process: the news starts in a community forum, then it’s picked up by a more specialised community/tech news website, then journalists at general media outlets see the story on those sites and write their own versions. I’ve seen this happen over and over again, and frequently taken part in it by discussing stories with journalists.In August 2015 it became clear that due to severe mismanagement, the “Bitcoin Core” project that maintains the program that runs the peer-to-peer network wasn’t going to release a version that raised the block size limit. The reasons for this are complicated and discussed below. But obviously, the community needed the ability to keep adding new users. So some long-term developers (including me) got together and developed the necessary code to raise the limit. That code was called BIP 101 and we released it in a modified version of the software that we branded Bitcoin XT. By running XT, miners could cast a vote for changing the limit. Once 75% of blocks were voting for the change the rules would be adjusted and bigger blocks would be allowed.The release of Bitcoin XT somehow pushed powerful emotional buttons in a small number of people. One of them was a guy who is the admin of the bitcoin.org website and top discussion forums. He had frequently allowed discussion of outright criminal activity on the forums he controlled, on the grounds of freedom of speech. But when XT launched, he made a surprising decision. XT, he claimed, did not represent the “developer consensus” and was therefore not really Bitcoin. Voting was an abomination, he said, because:So he decided to do whatever it took to kill XT completely, starting with censorship of Bitcoin’s primary communication channels: any post that mentioned the words “Bitcoin XT” was erased from the discussion forums he controlled, XT could not be mentioned or linked to from anywhere on the official bitcoin.org website and, of course, anyone attempting to point users to other uncensored forums was also banned. Massive numbers of users were expelled from the forums and prevented from expressing their views.As you can imagine, this enraged people. Read the comments on the announcement to get a feel for it.Eventually, some users found their way to a new uncensored forum. Reading it is a sad thing. Every day for months I have seen raging, angry posts railing against the censors, vowing that they will be defeated.But the inability to get news about XT or the censorship itself through to users has some problematic effects.For the first time, investors have no obvious way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Dissenting views are being systematically suppressed. Technical criticisms of what Bitcoin Core is doing are being banned, with misleading nonsense being peddled in its place. And it’s clear that many people who casually bought into Bitcoin during one of its hype cycles have no idea that the system is about to hit an artificial limit.This worries me a great deal. Over the years governments have passed a large number of laws around securities and investments. Bitcoin is not a security and I do not believe it falls under those laws, but their spirit is simple enough: make sure investors are informed. When misinformed investors lose money, government attention frequently follows.People problems.When Satoshi left, he handed over the reins of the program we now call Bitcoin Core to Gavin Andresen, an early contributor. Gavin is a solid and experienced leader who can see the big picture. His reliable technical judgement is one of the reasons I had the confidence to quit Google (where I had spent nearly 8 years) and work on Bitcoin full time. Only one tiny problem: Satoshi never actually asked Gavin if he wanted the job, and in fact he didn’t. So the first thing Gavin did was grant four other developers access to the code as well. These developers were chosen quickly in order to ensure the project could easily continue if anything happened to him. They were, essentially, whoever was around and making themselves useful at the time.One of them, Gregory Maxwell, had an unusual set of views: he once claimed he had mathematically proven Bitcoin to be impossible. More problematically, he did not believe in Satoshi’s original vision.When the project was first announced, Satoshi was asked how a block chain could scale to a large number of payments. Surely the amount of data to download would become overwhelming if the idea took off? This was a popular criticism of Bitcoin in the early days and Satoshi fully expected to be asked about it. He said:It’s a simple argument: look at what existing payment networks handle, look at what it’d take for Bitcoin to do the same, and then point out that growth doesn’t happen overnight. The networks and computers of the future will be better than today. And indeed back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that, as he said to me, “it never really hits a scale ceiling” even when looking at more factors than just bandwidth.Maxwell did not agree with this line of thinking. From an interview in December 2014:The idea that Bitcoin is inherently doomed because more users means less decentralisation is a pernicious one. It ignores the fact that despite all the hype, real usage is low, growing slowly and technology gets better over time. It is a belief Gavin and I have spent much time debunking. And it leads to an obvious but crazy conclusion: if decentralisation is what makes Bitcoin good, and growth threatens decentralisation, then Bitcoin should not be allowed to grow.Instead, Maxwell concluded, Bitcoin should become a sort of settlement layer for some vaguely defined, as yet un-created non-blockchain based system.In a company, someone who did not share the goals of the organisation would be dealt with in a simple way: by firing him.But Bitcoin Core is an open source project, not a company. Once the 5 developers with commit access to the code had been chosen and Gavin had decided he did not want to be the leader, there was no procedure in place to ever remove one. And there was no interview or screening process to ensure they actually agreed with the project’s goals.As Bitcoin became more popular and traffic started approaching the 1mb limit, the topic of raising the block size limit was occasionally brought up between the developers. But it quickly became an emotionally charged subject. Accusations were thrown around that raising the limit was too risky, that it was against decentralisation, and so on. Like many small groups, people prefer to avoid conflict. The can was kicked down the road.Complicating things further, Maxwell founded a company that then hired several other developers. Not surprisingly, their views then started to change to align with that of their new boss.Co-ordinating software upgrades takes time, and so in May 2015 Gavin decided the subject must be tackled once and for all, whilst there was still about 8 months remaining. He began writing articles that worked through the arguments against raising the limit, one at a time.But it quickly became apparent that the Bitcoin Core developers were hopelessly at loggerheads. Maxwell and the developers he had hired refused to contemplate any increase in the limit whatsoever. They were barely even willing to talk about the issue. They insisted that nothing be done without “consensus”. And the developer who was responsible for making the releases was so afraid of conflict that he decided any controversial topic in which one side might “win” simply could not be touched at all, and refused to get involved.Thus despite the fact that exchanges, users, wallet developers, and miners were all expecting a rise, and indeed, had been building entire businesses around the assumption that it would happen, 3 of the 5 developers refused to touch the limit.Deadlock.Meanwhile, the clock was ticking.Despite the news blockade, within a few days of launching Bitcoin XT around 15% of all network nodes were running it, and at least one mining pool had started offering BIP101 voting to miners.That’s when the denial of service attacks started. The attacks were so large that they disconnected entire regions from the internet:In other cases, entire datacenters were disconnected from the internet until the single XT node inside them was stopped. About a third of the nodes were attacked and removed from the internet in this way.Worse, the mining pool that had been offering BIP101 was also attacked and forced to stop. The message was clear: anyone who supported bigger blocks, or even allowed other people to vote for them, would be assaulted.The attackers are still out there. When Coinbase, months after the launch, announced they had finally lost patience with Core and would run XT, they too were forced offline for a while.Despite the DoS attacks and censorship, XT was gaining momentum. That posed a threat to Core, so a few of its developers decided to organise a series of conferences named “Scaling Bitcoin”: one in August and one in December. The goal, it was claimed, was to reach “consensus” on what should be done. Everyone likes a consensus of experts, don’t they?It was immediately clear to me that people who refused to even talk about raising the limit would not have a change of heart because they attended a conference, and moreover, with the start of the winter growth season there remained only a few months to get the network upgraded. Wasting those precious months waiting for conferences would put the stability of the entire network at risk. The fact that the first conference actually banned discussion of concrete proposals didn’t help.So I didn’t go.Unfortunately, this tactic was devastatingly effective. The community fell for it completely. When talking to miners and startups, “we are waiting for Core to raise the limit in December” was one of the most commonly cited reasons for refusing to run XT. They were terrified of any media stories about a community split that might hurt the Bitcoin price and thus, their earnings.Now the last conference has come and gone with no plan to raise the limit, some companies (like Coinbase and BTCC) have woken up to the fact that they got played. But too late. Whilst the community was waiting, organic growth added another 100,000 transactions per day.Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, the two of five Bitcoin Core committers who support a block size increase (and the two who have been around the longest), both have a stellar reputation within the community. They recently wrote a joint article titled “Bitcoin is Being Hot-Wired for Settlement”.Jeff and Gavin are generally softer in their approach than I am. I’m more of a tell-it-like-I-see-it kinda guy, or as Gavin has delicately put it, “honest to a fault”. So the strong language in their joint letter is unusual. They don’t pull any punches:Failing to speak plainly, as they put it, has become more and more common. As an example, the plan Gavin and Jeff refer to was announced at the “Scaling Bitcoin” conferences but doesn’t involve making anything more efficient, and manages an anemic 60% capacity increase only through an accounting trick (not counting some of the bytes in each transaction). It requires making huge changes to nearly every piece of Bitcoin-related software. Instead of doing a simple thing and raising the limit, it chooses to do an incredibly complicated thing that might buy months at most, assuming a huge coordinated effort.One problem with using fees to control congestion is that the fee to get to the front of the queue might change after you made a payment. Bitcoin Core has a brilliant solution to this problem — allow people to mark their payments as changeable after they’ve been sent, up until they appear in the block chain. The stated intention is to let people adjust the fee paid, but in fact their change also allows people to change the payment to point back to themselves, thus reversing it.At a stroke, this makes using Bitcoin useless for actually buying things, as you’d have to wait for a buyer’s transaction to appear in the block chain … which from now on can take hours rather than minutes, due to the congestion.Core’s reasoning for why this is OK goes like this: it’s no big loss because if you hadn’t been waiting for a block before, there was a theoretical risk of payment fraud, which means you weren’t using Bitcoin properly. Thus, making that risk a 100% certainty doesn’t really change anything.In other words, they don’t recognise that risk management exists and so perceive this change as zero cost.This protocol change will be released with the next version of Core (0.12), so will activate when the miners upgrade. It was massively condemned by the entire Bitcoin community but the remaining Bitcoin Core developers don’t care what other people think, so the change will happen.If that didn’t convince you Bitcoin has serious problems, nothing will. How many people would think bitcoins are worth hundreds of dollars each when you soon won’t be able to use them in actual shops?Bitcoin has entered exceptionally dangerous waters. Previous crises, like the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, were all to do with the services and companies that sprung up around the ecosystem. But this one is different: it is a crisis of the core system, the block chain itself.More fundamentally, it is a crisis that reflects deep philosophical differences in how people view the world: either as one that should be ruled by a “consensus of experts”, or through ordinary people picking whatever policies make sense to them.Even if a new team was built to replace Bitcoin Core, the problem of mining power being concentrated behind the Great Firewall would remain. Bitcoin has no future whilst it’s controlled by fewer than 10 people. And there’s no solution in sight for this problem: nobody even has any suggestions. For a community that has always worried about the block chain being taken over by an oppressive government, it is a rich irony.Still, all is not yet lost. Despite everything that has happened, in the past few weeks more members of the community have started picking things up from where I am putting them down. Where making an alternative to Core was once seen as renegade, there are now two more forks vying for attention (Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited). So far they’ve hit the same problems as XT but it’s possible a fresh set of faces could find a way to make progress.There are many talented and energetic people working in the Bitcoin space, and in the past five years I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know many of them. Their entrepreneurial spirit and alternative perspectives on money, economics and politics were fascinating to experience, and despite how it’s all gone down I don’t regret my time with the project. I woke up this morning to find people wishing me well in the uncensored forum and asking me to stay, but I’m afraid I’ve moved on to other things. To those people I say: good luck, stay strong, and I wish you the best.[I wrote a short followup addressing some of the sillier conspiracy theories that have surfaced in the wake of this article]","tags":[],"author":"Mike Hearn","creation_date":"2016-01-15"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/top-5-chart-patterns-every-crypto-trader-should-know-9197c18bd042","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"These chart patterns will help you to identify and anticipate future market moves.","title":"Top 5 Chart Patterns Every Crypto Trader Should Know","detailed_content":"One key fundamental skill every crypto (and stock trader) needs to be fully conversant in is the art of reading chart patterns.If you are just getting started, this article will help you identify the most common chart patterns and for everyone else, it’s a refresher :)The Head and Shoulders pattern is a classic reversal pattern signaling a trend shift from bullish to bearish or vice versa. It consists of three peaks: the first and third (the shoulders) are of similar height, while the middle peak (the head) is higher.The neckline, formed by connecting the troughs between the peaks, acts as a support or resistance line. When the price breaks through this neckline, it indicates a reversal is underway.Usage: Traders can capitalize on this pattern by short-selling at the breakout of a bearish Head and Shoulders pattern, or buying at the breakout of an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern.These patterns signal potential trend reversals, resembling a “W” (Double Bottom) or an “M” (Double Top). In a Double Top, prices rise to a resistance level twice, failing to break through, and then reverse downward. A Double Bottom occurs when prices hit a support level twice, failing to drop further, and then reverse upward.Usage: Traders can look for these patterns at market extremes. A breakout below the neckline of a Double Top signals a potential short position, while a breakout above the neckline of a Double Bottom signals a buying opportunity.Triangle patterns signal consolidation, often leading to continuation or reversal of a trend. They can take three forms:Usage: Traders can take positions in the direction of the breakout, or consider symmetrical triangles as a potential signal for trend continuation or reversal.These patterns typically indicate a continuation of the existing trend after a brief consolidation period.Usage: When prices break out from a Flag or Pennant, traders can enter positions in the direction of the primary trend.This bullish continuation pattern resembles a teacup, with a rounded “cup” followed by a smaller “handle.” The handle indicates a minor consolidation, often leading to a breakout in the same direction as the initial uptrend.Usage: Traders can look for a breakout above the handle’s resistance level to enter a long position, anticipating a continuation of the previous uptrend.Learn how to identify each of the top 20 crypto chart patterns and download your own Chart Patterns PDF for quick reference.Knowing your crypto trading patterns is an invaluable tool for crypto traders, helping to provide insight into potential reversals or trend continuations.Mastering these five key patterns can significantly enhance your ability to navigate the crypto market’s volatility.

It also holds the key to unlocking AI’s full societal potential by enabling a truly open AI. In a world of AI solutions relying on performance battles of pre-trained AI models, ChatDKG stands for freedom of choice. A truly open AI approach allows anyone to define the trusted knowledge as the foundation for their AI solutions. It further extends the freedom of choice from trusted knowledge to multimodal support of a plethora of different AI models. For creators ready to take the plunge into the truly open AI future, an inception program is available to onboard them to ChatDKG.The currently prevalent approach in creating AI solutions is a siloed one — either in the shackles of a single AI model or a walled garden of external sources provided by a single organization. ChatDKG is breaking down those walls with an inclusive and open approach to creating AI solutions. Leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), it creates a neutral, inclusive knowledge foundation. As anyone publishes their knowledge to the DKG, their addition gets equipped with a timestamp, their identity, ascribed ownership, and verifiability proofs ensuring their knowledge is kept intact. Through a framework of decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), such knowledge is made available to any AI model as input to produce outputs that both have information provenance and respect data ownership. As trusted knowledge inputs become mission-critical for AI solutions, it ignites a knowledge economy where your knowledge network is your net worth.In addition to building trusted AI solutions with ChatDKG, participants in this new knowledge economy can get involved in growing the DKG in knowledge domains important to them. New types of autonomous knowledge networks can appear in any domain, narrow or wide, such as:Launching an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO) allows anyone to open up their mission to others who would like to join creating a knowledge foundation in that domain. Through an IPO, a paranet operator also ensures incentive rewards for participants that will add useful knowledge — knowledge miners. By accessing NeuroWeb network incentives for mining new knowledge, the paranet’s trusted knowledge grows in a crowdsourced way.The ChatDKG’s truly open AI does not only lower dependency on any single AI company, the freedom of choice of AI also ensures that any development in the field of AI models, prompt engineering, agent frameworks, or similar, is making your solution stronger. By putting the trusted knowledge foundation in the driving seat, the tech giants working on advancing AI systems are working in your favor as you are always able to use your knowledge network with the latest AI technologies.Those looking to build the next big thing with ChatDKG’s trusted AI solution or launch an Initial Paranet Offering can submit their application for the ChatDKG inception program to receive additional support from the OriginTrail team.

This achievement is a testament to the strong support from our community, who have been instrumental in helping us reach each milestone. In rewarding our community, we are thrilled to announce that we will reserve a portion of Ola tokens for our early and active Massive participants.Massive, a decentralized ZKP verification network, is dedicated to fostering mass adoption for Web3 technologies. Since its launch on the Ola testnet on April 2, 2024, Massive has experienced impressive growth solely through organic traffic. Within just a month, we’ve reached nearly 200,000 registrations and activated over 100,000 users. We are immensely thankful for the ongoing support and trust from our community, which has propelled us to this significant milestone.To express our appreciation and to protect the interests of our early community members from dilution by newer users, we have decided to conduct the first token distribution snapshot for early Massive participants.Phase 1: The first token distribution snapshot is scheduled for May 11 at 12:00 UTC. This will secure a portion of tokens specifically for Phase One participants, acknowledging their early support and active participation.Phase 2: Following the completion of Phase 1, we will initiate Phase 2, which involves resetting scores and starting anew for all participants. This ensures that Massive remains a fair game for everyone, with all users starting on an equal footing. Scores from Phase 1 will be preserved and displayed, maintaining transparency and continuity.Participants must keep their addresses active on Massive until the Token Generation Event (TGE) to qualify for the final token distribution. Detailed information about the token allocation and release rules will be announced prior to the TGE.The total amount of Ola Tokens you receive will be determined by the combined total of your invitation points and ZKP verification completion points accrued across each phase.In line with our commitment to ensuring “Massive is a fair game for all,” we will adjust the initial snapshot scores by considering the compensation score and actual mobile connections. These adjustments are necessary to accurately reflect your invitation points and ZKP verification efforts, ensuring fairness for all participants.The OlaVM Points (OVP) program is designed to reward and incentivize our community members. Currently, over 60,000 OVP holders are an essential part of our community. As loyal participants, many OVP holders have been actively engaged in registering as Massive nodes and participating in ZKP verification since Massive’s inception. For those of you holding both OVP and earning Massive Points, we have some exciting surprises planned for the future.Massive represents a bold initiative by Ola to realize a vision for the industry that not only brings technological innovation but also introduces new use cases. Although still in the early stages, the overwhelming support from our community gives us the confidence to continue pushing forward.

I was a college student with no money for rent, food, bills, or anything really. I was waiting for the clock to turn midnight when the monthly student welfare would be paid to my bank account. When the day officially changed, I withdrew a couple hundred euros from an ATM. But it wasn’t for bills or food. That money was earmarked for gassing up the car and driving to another city in the middle of the night to buy a used graphics card. Getting that card ASAP was my top priority in life.F\nast rewind a couple of weeks back, a friend of mine asked me if I had heard of something called Bitcoin. There was supposedly this Internet currency that had been rapidly gaining value, and anyone could mine it on their computer. Bitcoin was trading at about 15 euros a piece and it got me interested enough to read up on it and to figure out how mining works. To mine Bitcoin, you must harness your computer’s processing power in the quest of solving extremely complex mathematical problems.Other miners in the network are doing the same and the Bitcoin protocol automatically rewards the first one to get to the correct answer with Bitcoins. Due to the difficulty of the calculations, every miner in the network is essentially trying to guess the answer. The more guesses your machine can do per second, the more likely you’ll get it right. As more miners join the network, the problems get more difficult and earning coins slows down. Here’s a more in-depth explanation of the process.After some rough calculations, my computer’s hashing power would have yielded only 0.05 Bitcoins (0.75€) per day, which would not be worthwhile considering the cost of electricity. But there was another cryptocurrency, Litecoin that stole our attention. It was marketed as the “silver for Bitcoin’s gold” with faster transaction times, cheaper price and much faster mining due to it’s lower popularity. There were Cryptocurrency exchanges online enabling you to trade Litecoins for Bitcoins, euros and dollars. Mining Litecoins was far more profitable and my computer was able to eke out almost two Litecoins (5€) in a day. I started thinking about ways to scale the operation up as much as possible!The main component used in mining was the computer graphics card. Motherboards, processors and RAM memory did not play an important role at all. As long as your hardware had a PCI-E slot for a graphics card and a power supply capable of running it at full power, you could efficiently mine cryptocurrencies. I used to buy and sell a lot of computer hardware, so I had extra motherboards and other components lying around, but only a few graphics cards.I whipped up an improvised secondary computer from spare parts and took it as a test to my friend’s student dormitory where the electricity was “free”. Upon returning home, I rounded up all my computer parts and concluded that I could immediately run a total of five graphics cards spread across three computers at home. I just needed more cards, but there was an issue: I was completely broke, with overdue bills and the rent a few weeks late.I\nwas living on student welfare, totalling to about 500 euros per month. I also owned a car which was a luxury I really couldn’t afford. At the end of the month I was always scrambling for money, late on my bills and hoping I could find a way out of it. Mining cryptocurrencies seemed like a real opportunity to finally “make it”. I firmly decided to spend all of my money not on the rent, nor on my overdue bills, but on more graphics cards from nearby online sellers. I now had a total of three cards mining Litecoins day in, day out, yielding about 12€ of profit per day. The income already almost equaled my student welfare and I had no intention to stop expanding!Next up, my eyes were firmly set on a very specific date: March 4th, 2013. At midnight that day, I would receive my next student welfare payment. I had arranged the pickup for a new card for that night at 1:00 AM, just an hour after the money would land on my account. With my car running on fumes, I drove to a gas station, pulled the money out of an ATM and gassed up my trusty steed for the nightly drive. One more card, check!I spent the rest of the money next day to buy that fifth card with a cash deal in the city center. I tried to set aside some money for food and bills, but knew very well it wasn’t going to get me even through the rest of the week. Having food to eat was a minuscule goal compared to maxing out my mining specs.Mining cryptocurrencies requires a lot of power, which equates to a lot of heat. Running my miners at full power caused extreme overheating and I didn’t want to limit their speed. I did what any crypto-crazy miner would have done: I stripped out all the components from the miner cases and laid them on a table, bare, with all wires connected. I shoved the table against my kitchen ventilation window so the components could bask in the chilly air flowing inside.It looked like a true fire hazard with no cases, cables hanging everywhere and everything exposed. Instead of being able to press the power button of a computer case, I was now turning the computers on and resetting them by short-circuiting the motherboard pins with a screwdriver. But man did they run cool. Even at peak power, the card temperatures were far below the max, making them work for prolonged periods without crashing.By\nnow I was making a profit of about 20 euros per day. To expand, I would have to acquire even more base components and graphics cards. I sold all my valuable belongings and the mined coins as soon as they were coming in. With these and the help of buy now, pay later services, I was able to buy new top-end motherboards, second hand graphics cards to fill them up and the hefty power supplies required to run them. I was also able to rack up a pretty admirable debt in the process!I crammed yet another miner on the kitchen table, one next to the backyard door and a third one in the middle of my living room floor. No cases, propped up on cardboard boxes and operated via my trusty screwdriver. There were a total of 14 graphics cards mining coins, yielding about 55 euros of profits every single day. The cash flow was hard to argue against so I kept reinvesting everything on mining.I upgraded all my cards to the newest HD7900 series, which brought about a 50% boost in hashing power. I then populated even my bedroom with a mining rig, shooting up my profits to 80 euros per day! I had installed TeamViewer on my smartphone to fine tune my miners, even when I wasn’t home. It felt like doing an on-call shift 24/7 with multiple incidents occurring every single day, just to maximize my profits.Upgrading the cards had raised my farm’s total power consumption to over 5 kilowatts. I had already distributed the miners to multiple areas in the apartment before to avoid blowing individual easy-to-replace fuses, but now it didn’t matter where the miners were located anymore. Mining at full power and flipping on the stove or going to the sauna could have blown the main fuse of the apartment. I couldn’t add a single card more.It\nwas July 2013 and the warmest month of the year in Finland. Ambient temperatures in my crib eventually crept up to a shocking 43 degrees celsius (109°F) during daytime. I didn’t have to worry about going to the sauna anymore, I was living in one.The combined noise of all the cards’ fans spinning at 100% was deafening and resembled the sound of operating a vacuum cleaner, times three. I asked my neighbors if they had heard any noise, just to be sure I wouldn’t bother them. I myself was already numb to it.To optimize my miners, I started running them slower during the day and cranked em’ up at night. I now kept switching between different cryptocurrencies, depending on which one was the most profitable to mine at any given moment. I may have woken up mining Litecoin and switched to Worldcoin or Feathercoin by lunch. It was the only way to maintain high profitability. I even set up an alarm system for any price changes and it sure kept me on the edge day and night.W\nhen the summer was nearing its end, the weather cooled down and the living conditions in my apartment became humane again. I was able to run my miners at acceptable speeds again, especially at night.The influx of new people entering the crypto mining game during the summer had dropped my daily mining profits to 30–40€ per day. Meanwhile, my monthly electricity bill was hovering somewhere around a thousand euros. I was barely breaking even, but I kept on going, hoping to mine the right coin at the right time.Once winter officially arrived, I cranked up my miners to full speed. Even so, the ambient temperature in my apartment was only 10 degrees celsius (50°F) with all doors and windows open. I was dressed in full winter clothing to fight the cold and wore shoes because the floor was close to freezing temperature.I slept my nights on the living room couch with the aforementioned alarms blaring in case a miner had crashed or if I had to switch the mined coin. I was enjoying some of my greatest profits so far, gaining a good 100 euros per day on average, but I was also battling a new foe: snow.Yes, the spring, summer and autumn rains were a blessing when it came to temperatures, but snow is floaty. Snowflakes of all sizes would fly in through the doors and windows and land on my mining clusters. Snow and electricity don’t mix well, so I devised various types of plastic and cardboard shelters, under which the miners could hide. But it wasn’t enough.I woke up to a crashed miner alert. It had been snowing heavily and the snow had landed on the miner shelter next to the backyard door. The melted snow accumulated into enough water to drip through the cover and crash the miner. I dried up the components and used my screwdriver to short-circuit the start button pins; maybe it could still work?My action was immediately met by a negating flash of fire originating from the miner’s 700 euro Radeon HD7990 dual GPU graphics card. It seemed as if someone had lit a big fat match inside of my crown jewel card, rendering it into trash metal. It cost me a big bunch of my profits, but times were good so I was able to recoup the losses in no time.E\nven though mining was extremely profitable, there were new FPGA and ASIC miners being developed in China, which would soon render graphics card mining futile. They were purpose-built pieces of hardware dedicated to mining cryptocurrencies, constantly driving down coin prices due to increased hash rates. I decided to hang tight as long as mining was even slightly profitable. There was still bread for the taking. And then something big happened: the release of Dogecoin.It was based on the wildly popular doge meme and had no real use cases or purpose. Being a huge fan of doge, I directed all my hashing power over to mine it, even though you couldn’t even sell it anywhere yet. I was betting hard on the fact that a useless meme coin had immense potential to go viral and end up precious.I managed to mine millions and millions of Dogecoins before it was inevitably listed on an online exchange. I welcomed the opening price with open arms and proceeded to unload them all for a profit of almost 10,000 euros. It was the big fish I had been waiting for. This was followed by a few more months of gradually lowering mining profits, after which I decided to call it quits.I sold whatever equipment I still could, trying to recoup as much money as possible from my battle-worn miner army. I paid off all my debts, bills and rent, and the cold realization hit me: I had nothing left over to show for it. A year of full-time effort spent, living in inhumane conditions, becoming a nervous wreck. And nothing?Back then it did indeed feel like nothing. But now those experiences are cherished memories of boldly jumping into the unknown, self-discovery and never staying stagnant in the progress of technology.And hey! At least I got a nice story to tell about it.If you enjoyed the story, feel free to follow my account for more goodness in the coming weeks ❤️","tags":[],"author":"Lemon King","creation_date":"2022-10-18"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@nicholas-sismil/how-to-solve-the-blockchain-trilemma-a-blockdag-and-nakamoto-consensus-friendship-4573625c1697","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Thesis: The blockchain trilemma claims that a network can only implement and maintain two of the three properties at any given time…","title":"How to Solve the Blockchain Trilemma: A BlockDAG and Nakamoto Consensus Friendship","detailed_content":"Thesis: The blockchain trilemma claims that a network can only implement and maintain two of the three properties at any given time: decentralization, security, and scalability. Building upon Nakamoto Consensus through BlockDAG theory¹ solves the blockchain trilemma. Solving the trilemma implies two things, a) Satoshi’s peer-to-peer electronic cash system can be realized, and b) the most efficient layer-1 infrastructure can be created. Nakamoto Consensus alone cannot efficiently handle orphan blocks and is limited by a synchronous model, limiting its scalability and security. However, I will show how BlockDAG theory unlocks the full potential of Nakamoto Consensus.Within this essay, I will explain 1) what Nakamoto Consensus is, 2) why it has difficulty scaling, and 3) how implementing BlockDAG technology scales Nakamoto Consensus. I will explain 3) by providing a history of BlockDAG theory. This history will primarily cover the following protocols: GHOST, Inclusive protocols, SPECTRE, PHANTOM, GHOSTDAG, and DAGKNIGHT. Lastly, I will conclude how BlockDAG theory fulfills the three properties of the blockchain trilemma for Nakamoto Consensus.Nakamoto Consensus is a proof-of-work² consensus mechanism for the algorithmic ordering of a blockchain. Let’s cover some jargon: proof-of-work, blockchain, and algorithmic ordering. Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor initially introduced proof-of-work in their work, Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail³, to combat Denial-of-service attacks; however, Nakamoto proof-of-work is primarily useful to combat Sybil attacks (an attack where one or a few gain disproportionate influence over decisions made in the network by obtaining an abundance of computing resources). To combat Sybil attacks, participants (otherwise known as miners) in a proof-of-work system solve challenging computational proofs to confirm blocks within the network (i.e., the confirmation of transactions) to receive a reward. Moreover, the nature of computation allows the network to quantify how much work a given proof contains.Blockchains are distributed systems that are run in a decentralized manner by nodes that do not need to trust one another. These systems must agree on a history or state of the world through a consensus. Moreover, these consensus orderings must satisfy certain properties to obtain “correctness.” Nakamoto Consensus⁴ adopts the correctness theory proposed by Leslie Lamport in Proving the Correctness of Multiprocess Programs⁵. Lamport argued that both liveness and safety properties must apply to achieve correctness. Safety is the inability to revert a decision, while liveness is the inability to delay a decision.Blockchains work according to a total ordering on which a miner appends an entry (otherwise known as a block of transactions) atop a previous entry known as a reference (previous block hash). Within a total order, events have an exact order based on which event occurred first, creating a chain.Chains may also form natural forks where a second one-directional chain is built alongside the main chain. This happens when two miners create blocks at approximately the same time. When forks occur, the previous chain — known as an orphan chain — is no longer useful as the network decided to move forward with the new chain. Miners determine which blockchain to work on based on the Nakamoto consensus ordering algorithm, the longest chain rule. According to the longest chain rule (well, it actually works on a heaviest chain rule, but I am sweeping this detail under the rug for simplicity), miners must choose the chain that has computed the most-accumulated proof-of-work by analyzing the difficulties of each block in that specific blockchain (i.e., a more computational effort has been expended to verify and confirm blocks within the network on one chain than another). For simplicity’s sake, it’s assumed that the longest chain by height correlates to the longest chain by aggregate work/hashes computed.It’s important to note that once a fork is resolved, transactions on the losing blockchain are invalidated unless they were simultaneously included in the winning blockchain.⁶ This wastes electricity and computational power and slows down the network.The longest chain rule also adheres to a block delay, L, whereby L continuously updates to keep block arrivals (otherwise known as the block creation or confirmation time)⁷ in ~10 minutes. The combination of L and proof-of-works computational power fulfills liveness and safety, as network users can assume with high probability that it is infeasible to reverse transactions after some number of blocks. Thus, Bitcoin functions according to a synchronous model, which assumes an agreed global upper bound on the network delay.The longest-chain rule, however, is vulnerable to history rewrites if an attacker mines a chain longer than the honest chain. A history rewrite (otherwise known as a reorganization or reorg) can be used for fraud — for example, let’s say that a participant, person A, purchases a rare guitar from another participant, person B, for 2 BTC. Person A sees the transaction is included in block D and, thus, hands over the guitar. However, person B decides to mine two consecutive blocks, E and F, on top of block C, using the same funds they used to buy the guitar to pay themselves. All miners will abandon block D and start extending block F due to the longest chain rule, and person A is left without 2 BTC and their guitar. This is called a double-spend attack.Person A can protect themselves from such an attack by waiting for a few blocks after block D before they give person B the guitar, reducing the chance that person B will succeed in building a competing chain. Typically, a transaction is considered confirmed once six blocks have passed (resulting in a confirmation time of 60 minutes). This default time is based on the assumption, α, that an attacker has 10% of the network’s total hash rate and a risk, ε, of \u003c0.1% a node is willing to absorb⁸. However, if person B has 51% of the mining power, they can implement a reorg regardless of how long person A waits. This is because person B’s block creation rate is higher than the other miners’ creation rates combined. Thus, proof-of-work systems assume that at least 50% of the honest mining power must belong to honest participants. More specifically, a 49% attack is prevented by math, and a 51% attack is prevented by money. The probability of a 49% attack to succeed decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations. A 51% attack has a chance to win if it can run long enough; however, the cost of such an attack is huge.In their paper, Secure High-Rate Transaction Processing in Bitcoin⁹, Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar proved how increasing Bitcoin’s throughput — either by increasing the block creation rate λ, or the block size, b — could reduce the 51% attack threshold to implement a reorg.Increasing the block size. Sompolinsky and Zohar studied the work of Christian Decker and Roger Wattenhofer in Information Propagation in the Bitcoin Network¹⁰, taking a large sample of network nodes from height 180,000 to 190,000 of the public ledger. As shown below, it was discovered a linear relationship between block size and propagation time; the larger the block size, the longer the propagation time. The linear increase occurs because of the verification time — i.e., if a block is five times larger, it takes a node five times longer to verify the block before rebroadcasting it.For example, let’s say the Bitcoin community wants to scale the network to Visa levels to process 2,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin’s current throughput is about 7 transactions per second due its current block size of 2 MBs. Thus, Visa levels would require a block size 285 times larger, equalling 570 MBs. With a network delay of 285 seconds (assuming the network delay is linear) and a block creation rate of one block every 600 seconds (10 minutes), there is a 285/600\u003d0.475 chance that another block will be created — meaning almost 50% of the blocks will belong to forks. This allows an attacker to maintain a reorg attack simply by creating blocks faster than the main chain.Increasing the block creation rate. Bitcoin’s network delay is about 1 second, and as we know, a new block is created on average every 600 seconds (10 minutes). Because the average block’s creation time is 600 times bigger than the network delay, it’s improbable that a block will be mined while another block is still propagated.¹¹ However, the likelihood increases once the block creation rate increases. If the block creation rate increases, more blocks will be created while the most recent block in the main chain is propagated. This will cause more forks as the likelihood of every miner not being up to date will also increase. Similarly, as in the case of increasing block sizes, attackers can execute reorg attacks by creating blocks faster than the main chain with less than 51% hash power, as shown in the illustration below.When an attacker sees a fork trying to be resolved (causing a temporary slowdown of the main chain), the attacker will use that time to outrun the main chain to create a longer chain (known as selfish mining)¹². The longer chain will start as a secret chain until it’s long enough to be announced and adopted by the other miners. Moreover, the attacker can do this with less than 51% of the hash power. Why? Because if half of the blocks are forked, only two-thirds of them will go into the main chain — meaning an attacker only needs 50%×(2/3)\u003d33% of the hashing power to sustain an attack. Moreover, electricity and computational costs are more significantly wasted, increasing the cost for new miners to enter the network and, thus, causing further centralization.GHOST (The Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree)¹³ paved the way for BlockDAGs, as it resolved forking conflicts by using forks for the protocol’s advantage — thereby increasing throughput and security, as attackers can no longer outpace the network. The topology of Nakamoto Consensus changes with GHOST as aggregate work is viewed with a 2-dimensional view instead of a 1-dimensional view via tree graphs.¹⁴Instead of following the longest rule at each fork, GHOST proposes to follow the heaviest subtree. In other words, the protocol will follow the path of a subtree with the combined hardest proof-of-work or difficulty.Let’s take a look at the following illustration above. As we can see, multiple forks have been generated alongside the main chain (either by increasing the block creation rate or size); by the second layer, there is a three-pronged fork, and another by the 3rd layer. The attacker’s chain (6 blocks) is longer than the main chain of the network ending in 5B and would assume the place of the main chain under the longest-chain rule. However, under GHOST, the main chain selected is the one with the most combined work.Thus, GHOST considers all blocks within the network and incorporates forked blocks within the main chain; this saves electricity and computational power and also increases throughput as the block creation rate or size can increase without harming security. Sompolinsky and Zohar provided data to demonstrate this, by simulating the network with 1,000 nodes according to several uniform parameters. As the block creation rate increases, security remains constant for blockchains.Ethereum, as a proof-of-work blockchain, was able to increase its throughput higher than Bitcoin (roughly 20 transactions-per-second compared to Bitcoin’s 7 transactions-per-second) and decrease wastage by implementing a variant of GHOST, as an inclusive protocol, from the work, Inclusive Block Chain Protocols, by Yoad Lewenberg, Yonatan Sompolinsky, and Aviv Zohar.¹⁵In an Inclusive protocol, the following properties are obtained: (1) new blocks reference multiple predecessors; (2) non-conflicting transactions within blocks outside of the main chain are included in the ledger; and (3) miners of blocks outside the main chain receive a portion of the block reward. Within Ethereum, however, transactions in referenced forked blocks are not included in the ledger, and miners of these transactions do not receive transaction fees. Only referenced orphan block (otherwise called Ommer blocks) miners receive a portion of the block reward.¹⁶However, while GHOST made headway to increase the scalability and security on top of Nakamoto-generalized protocols, it still had its flaws. First, improved security comes at the expense of slightly slower time resolving forks; for example, GHOST couldn’t scale to, say, 1 second blocks. Or it can be said that the more “inclusive” you are (in the sense of how distant a cousin has to be from the main chain to be included), the worse your confirmation times become. Secondly, miners who are better connected to the network could gain rewards greater than their fair share. Lastly, the ability to form secret chains still remains possible with selfish mining.GHOST introduced graph theory with subtrees¹⁷ as a generalized Nakamoto Consensus mechanism. SPECTRE¹⁸ took the idea further by implementing a full BlockDAG to build upon Nakamoto generalization. In other words, in GHOST, trees were leveraged to solve Nakamoto’s orphan rate problem, and SPECTRE leverages a BlockDAG to solve the orphan rate problem. Moreover, SPECTRE provides greater scalability than GHOST or basic Nakamoto Consensus by implementing weak liveness.What is a BlockDAG? DAG stands for direct acrylic graph; meaning (1) it is a data structure moving in one direction; (2) the data structure is non-cyclical, and therefore cannot return to a previous state from the current state; and (3) it is structured as a graph, G\u003d(V, E), with vertices and edges. In typical DAG structures, transactions are documented as vertices without the implementation of blocks, and edges provide direction for each vertex. However, vertices within BlockDAGs are blocks, which reference multiple predecessor blocks (or parent blocks) instead of a single predecessor. In other words, to extend the ledger within a BlockDAG, blocks reference all tips of the graph (that their miners observe locally) instead of referencing the tip of the single longest chain. A DAG built of blocks decreases the forking dilemma of Nakamoto Consensus, as the main chain can now point to forked blocks; more so, work is no longer discarded when facing an attacker.The topology of a BlockDAG is such that if U and V are connected by the edge e\u003d(U →V), U comes before V in the ordering, O. In other words, if a path exists from block V to block U in the DAG, block U was created before block V and should precede V in the global order. However, a defined ordering is needed when blocks are created in parallel — i.e., a set of blocks without a path connecting them, as in the case of forks. This is where SPECTRE comes in. SPECTRE is an ordering algorithm that eliminates transactions in conflict with previous ones.SPECTRE’s ordering is conducted through a pairwise voting mechanism to determine how likely transactions will be reversed. For each pair of blocks U, V, a vote must determine whether U defeats V or V defeats U, denoted by U\u003eV or V\u003eU. Moreover, within a set of transactions, a transaction embedded in U is accepted if block U defeats all blocks containing conflicting transactions¹⁹. This is quite abstract; let’s break it down. First, “defeat,” denoted as U\u003eV, does not mean one block is greater than the other. Rather it means one comes before the other, i.e., U comes before V. Furthermore, defeating one block with another only matters if conflicting transactions are present between the two; otherwise, non-conflicting transactions will always be accepted.Voting is conducted by the blocks themselves (the determiners). There are three ways a block, Z, may conduct a vote: (1) if block V has a path back to U, then Z will vote U\u003eV; (2) if there is no path between block V and U, Z will vote for the block within its local ordering it can see — so if Z sees U but not V, then U\u003eV; (3) if there is no path between V and U and Z sees both U and V, then it’ll vote according to a recursive computation based on how other past blocks have voted. For example, Block 12 (in the image below²⁰) votes for an ordering that does not contain blocks 10,11, and 12 because more blocks voted for X\u003eY in 12’s past than 9–10–11’s voted for Y\u003eX. This is a generalization of the longest chain rule, as the path chosen is the path with the most votes.SPECTRE’s Weak Liveness. Unlike Bitcoin and other Nakamoto generalizations covered, SPECTRE is agnostic to the network’s global network delay, D. An upper bound of D is assumed; however, the bound is assumed locally by each node, which each node can adjust as network conditions change. This allows SPECTRE to achieve fast confirmation times during healthy periods and maintain responsiveness during network conflicts. In this positive sense, this is also known as a parameterless model; however, “self-scaling” is better term. Moreover, each node is responsible for its choice in D, as an overly inaccurate choice can harm them. For example, if a node overestimates D, it cannot recognize an irreversible transaction, and if a node underestimates D, it will accept transactions prematurely.Liveliness is therefore weakened; however, it is only weakened when conflicting transactions occur. In other words, as long as there are no conflicting blocks, ordering doesn’t matter. The “voting” mechanism kicks in only if a conflict is detected. For example, if a published transaction with zero published conflicts is guaranteed irreversibility very quickly. However, suppose two or more conflicting transactions are published simultaneously or soon after one another. In that case, their irreversibility will be decided on within a longer finite time frame. This allows a significant increase in throughput.Nonetheless, it’s important to note that SPECTRE was designed solely for payment use cases, whereby the owner of the funds functions as the sole entity to produce and sign transactions (including conflicting ones). SPECTRE’s pairwise ordering is not transitive²¹ and, thus, does not provide a linear ordering, as blocks can switch places long after being confirmed (without invalidating transactions). This does not work for smart contracts as strict ordering among transactions is required; otherwise, having out-of-order computations can cause some to fail, and users could feed the contracts with conflicting inputs. With this in mind, GHOSTDAG was designed to support smart contacts by implementing a converging linear ordering.GHOSTDAG implements a total ordering, allowing the ability to develop smart contracts atop the protocol as computation will occur in exactly the way the designer intended. The trade-off is that GhostDAG implements an upper bound on the network latency time, and is thus, non-responsive to network latency. GHOSTDAG is built upon the foundations of PHANTOM in PHANTOM GHOSTDAG: A Scalable Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus by Yonatan Sompolinsky, Shai Wyborski, and Aviv Zohar.²²PHANTOM. PHANTOM is a blockDAG ordering algorithm constructed theoretically without real-world efficiency in mind. PHANTOM’s goal is to order honest blocks in a well-connected manner. Since honest nodes aren’t withholding blocks and communicating with one another, their computational work should be well connected. On the other hand, an attacker developing a secret side chain would be disconnected from the main chain. In a typical BlockDAG, each block references all blocks known to its miner when it was created, but how do we know which blocks are well-connected and which aren’t?From a single block’s perspective, B, a BlockDAG is divided into three subsets: the block’s past (the set of blocks reachable from B), future (the set of all blocks from which B is reachable (equivalently the set of all blocks which have B in their past), and the block’s anticone. Anticones are blocks that are neither a block’s past nor future. The well-connected set is the biggest sub-DAG (otherwise known as a K-cluster) where no block has an anticone greater than K. In other words, the PHANTOM optimization rule always returns a max K-connected cluster, such that a tie-breaking rule is implemented if there are several maximal K-clusters.K represents the maximum antigone size within a K-cluster, and K must be greater than 2Dλ, whereby D equals the network delay and λ equals the block creation rate. K is hard coded in PHANTOM (and GHOSTDAG) and is, thus, selected in a predetermined manner. Therefore, deciding the value of K is very important. If the value of K is too large, too many forks will occur, reducing the network’s security; if the value of K is too small, it will limit the network’s performance, lowering the throughput.For example, if we look at the well-connected blocks highlighted in blue in the diagram above (with K\u003d3), we can now identify that each blue block has at most 3 blue blocks in its anticone. Thus, at most, 4 blocks are assumed to be created within each unit of delay, and the anticone size should not exceed 3. Therefore, blocks outside the cluster, E, H, and K (colored red), belong to the attacker. For instance, block E has 6 blue blocks in its anticone (B, C, D, F, G, and I), as these blocks didn’t reference E (as E was likely withheld from its miners). Similarly, block K has 6 blue blocks in its anticone (B, C, G, F, I, and J).However, finding a maximal K-cluster is NP-hard, meaning that the likelihood of proving it will result in the breakdown of what we know about computer science. Moreover, PHANTOM does not work in an incremental manner; whenever the DAG updates, the entire computation must be restarted — requiring the storage of the entire DAG structure.GHOSTDAG and its Linear Ordering. GHOSTDAG functions as a greedy variant of PHANTOM, allowing a practical approach for adoption. A greedy variant is an algorithm that solves a problem by making the locally optimal choice at each process stage. Thus, instead of finding a maximal K-connected cluster, GHOSTDAG approximates K incrementally and recursively. It does this by numbering each block with a blue score, indicating how many blocks in its past are in the K-cluster.²³For example, if we look at Figure 3 from the PHANTOM GHOSTDAG paper, we can see how block M is recursively selected within a given K-cluster, G, with K\u003d3. The circled number is the score of blue blocks in the DAG’s past. The GHOSTDAG algorithm greedily selects a chain starting from the highest scoring tip, M, and then K, as K is the highest scoring tip in M’s past (and then H, and D — D is arbitrarily selected to break the tie between C, D, and E — and lastly, the genesis). This chain is used to construct the blue block set of the DAG.In step 1, while visiting D, the genesis block is added to the blue set since it is the only block in D’s past. In step 2, H is visited, and the blue blocks in its past — C, D, and E — are added. In step 3, K is visited with the blocks of its past — H and I — added. However, block B is not added to the overall blue set because it has an anticone of 4. In step 4, M is visited with K added to the blue set. F was not added due to its large anticone. In the last step, 5, a hypothetical block, V, is visited, (whose past equals the DAG) with M added to the blue set. Block L and J are left out as L has a large anticone and because adding J would increase the anticone of L even more.However, what happens when an attacker allows their blocks to point to honest blocks to increase their blue score? GHOSTDAG implements a mechanism to stop this, known as the freeloading bound. The bound mechanism ensures that a miner can only freeload older blocks by a specific constant (namely 3k+1 blocks). Thus, changing the ordering of arbitrarily old blocks will run into a race where freeloading does not provide the attacker any advantage over honest nodes who consistently point to other honest blocks.GHOSTDAG affords nearly immediate confirmation times (in the order of seconds). For example, Kaspa, built according to GHOSTDAG, achieves 10 blocks per second, or roughly 3,000 transactions per second.²⁴However, It’s important to note that while a maximum K-cluster is not calculated in GHOSTDAG, parameter D is still chosen in advance — thereby assuming an a priori bound on the worst-case latency.²⁵ Thus, the BlockDAG under GHOSTDAG functions synchronously, meaning that there exists some known finite time bound Δ, whereby with any message sent, an adversary can delay its delivery by at most Δ. Moreover, setting an upper delay bound leads to a margin of error to maintain security, meaning two things:(A) If latency improves below D, the confirmation time becomes suboptimal.(B) If latency degrades above D, security will degrade with it.For example, GHOSTDAG’s upper delay bound is set to 10 seconds, thus, given (A) and (B), if latency increases to 12 seconds for a period, a 45% attacker could take over the network; if latency increases to 60 seconds, a 25% attacker could take over the network. It’s important to note that this holds for all PoW chains.DAGKNIGHT is a BlockDAG ordering algorithm written by Michael Sutton and Yonatan Sompolinsky in their work, The DAG KNIGHT Protocol: A Parameterless Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus.²⁶ DAGKNIGHT solves GHOSTDAG’s issues by designing a version of GHOSTDAG (maintaining its strong liveness) in a parameterless way by monitoring network conditions to determine the best current K and D.²⁷ In other words, instead of guaranteeing a 10-second confirmation delay, the confirmation time adapts automatically according to miner network conditions and optimizations in the block validation algorithm.How does DAGKNIGHT do this? First off, it’s important to note that DAGKNIGHT is a greedy iteration of PHANTOM-X,²⁸ a term only known within the DAGKNIGHT research circle (i.e., the term doesn’t exist within the DAGKNIGHT paper). Instead of choosing K in advance, PHANTOM-X looks for the smallest K such that the largest K-cluster covers more than half of the blocks while maintaining 50% fault tolerance.For example, as shown in the image below,²⁹ as an attackers fraction (on the right side of [a],[b], and [c]) grows from 𝛼 \u003d 0.05 in (a) to 𝛼 \u003d 0.45 in (c), the PHANTOM-X algorithm finds a K-cluster of sufficient width to cover at least 50% of the DAG, thereby outweighing the minority attacker.Moreover, as shown in the second image below,³⁰ confirmation times change according to various network conditions. For example, as latency begins at 2 seconds per block in (a) and decreases to 0.1 seconds in (c), K decreases from 4 in (a) to 0 in (c). The confirmation time decreases from 12 seconds in (a) to 1.2 seconds in (c)while covering 50% of the DAG — demonstrating that confirmation times of PHANTOM-X change according to various network conditions while maintaining a security threshold of 50%.In other words, PHANTOM finds a maximal k-cluster, which is NP impossible; so, a greedy variant was created, GHOTSDAG. Similarly, the PHANTOM-X solves the harder problem of a minimal maximal k-cluster (the minimal k such that the maximal k-cluster is at least half of the DAG). Therefore, DAGKNIGHT was created to follow a greedy variant of PHANTOM-X to recursively find a K-cluster of sufficient width to cover at least 50% of the DAG. The greediness (or, more accurately, “incrementality”) is *required* for establishing security: without it, the protocol cannot promise that the maximal K-cluster computed at some times doesn’t exclude blocks in earlier K-clusters.DAGKNIGHT’s incrementality can resist 50% attacks without relying on network latency assumptions. Therefore, a margin of error is not required because if network conditions degrade, confirmation times will automatically increase to compensate. Moreover, this allows DAGKNIGHT to adjust block confirmation times according to real-time network conditions. For example, when the network’s adversarial latency is low, DAGKNIGHT’s orderings converge immediately, allowing clients to confirm transactions within a few Round Trip Times. On the other hand, when the network is slow and clogged, the orderings converge more slowly, and thus, allow the transaction confirmations to take longer.It’s important to note that the parameterlessness property of DAGKNIGHT also holds for SPECTER; however, it comes at the cost of only having weak liveness (prohibiting the implementation of smart contracts). DAGKNIGHT, on the other hand, achieves BOTH parameterlessness AND strong liveness — and is the first protocol to do so.Some may argue that Nakamoto Consensus, namely the Bitcoin protocol, doesn’t need to scale, as the cryptocurrency is meant to be held as a store of value. This argument is not ridiculous, as it serves as an alternative to gold and silver. Nonetheless, if we want to fulfill Satoshi’s vision of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, it must scale, as nobody will want to wait once 6 blocks have passed (60 minutes) to purchase something.³¹ Moreover, it has been shown that original Nakamoto Consensus cannot scale due to its synchronous nature and its conflicts arising from forks. However, it has been shown that generalized Nakamoto Consensus can- i.e., the BlockDAG protocols summarized above, namely GHOST, SPECTRE, GHOSTDAG, and DAGKNIGHT.One may ask, why keep proof-of-work and mining to (a) fulfill Satoshi’s payment vision and (b) develop a layer 1 blockchain? Or more importantly, why solve the blockchain trilemma using generalized Nakamoto Consensus (as solving the blockchain trilemma achieves both [a] and [b])? The answer is that generalized Nakamoto Consensus achieves high levels of decentralization and security, especially compared to proof-of-stake and other Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocols. What original Nakamoto Consensus lacked was scalability. It’s already been shown that generalized Nakamoto Consensus is scalable. Therefore, if we can demonstrate that generalized Nakamoto Consensus, namely BlockDAG theory, is decentralized and secure, we can solve the blockchain trilemma.Decentralization. Nakamoto Consensus is decentralized because miners within proof-of-work must continuously invest in order to maintain their relative power. This supports (1) economic decentralization and (2) a more permissionless system. Why is this the case? Let’s explain (1) and (2) by comparing proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. In proof-of-stake, staked participants do not need to continually invest in order to secure the network. Instead, already powerful nodes can gain more power since staked currency produces more currency from network rewards — empowering large stakeholders. This means there can be only one type of node on the network — a rich one. In contrast, miners within proof-of-work must update their hardware, maintain stable electrical costs, and ensure external factors do not interfere with production (i.e., storage, housing, and so on). For (2), anyone can provide proof-of-work and try to produce a block within the main chain. However, in proof-of-stake, users must either be a rich node or delegate their stake to the rich nodes, increasing the barrier of entry to participate in the network’s security and operations.But what about other DAGS? Why focus on BlockDAG innovations? Many DAGS, such as IOTA, Byteball, and Nano, are blockless DAGs. Blockless is a fancy term for blocks with one transaction. Blocks with one transaction are not scalable. It is a “feature” which disables economies of scale, as users can no longer delegate their transactions to service providers to aggregate transactions. DAGs of this nature also rely on centralized authorities such as Coordinators double-checking all transactions, and thus, create a single point of failure.Moreover, many blockchains utilize DAGs to process their transactions but not their ledgers (i.e., they are not a true DAG-based ledger). Blockchains within this camp include Fantom and Aleph Zero. On the other hand, current projects utilizing a DAG ledger operate according to proof-of-stake; thus, they are less secure, with a security threshold of 33% compared to 50%. These projects include Avalanche X-Chain and SUI.³²Security. Nakamoto Consensus is secure as it has a security threshold of 50%, meaning that an attacker must have at least 51% of the network’s hash power to overcome the network. A security threshold of 50% is the highest security threshold modern-day cryptography can achieve, compared to Byzantine Fault Tolerant and proof-of-stake protocols, which are only resilient to an attacker achieving 33% of the network’s economic power. Moreover, BlockDAG Nakamoto generalizations significantly increase original Nakamoto security by solving conflicts arising from forks and hardwired upper bounds on network delays. Moreover, Nakamoto Consensus’ security exists within its own protocol and outside global forces. This is because proof-of-work creates harder, sounder money, as its value is anchored to markets beyond itself and an objective, physical grounding, such as electricity, computing hardware, and warehouses situated across the globe.Some criticize proof-of-work’s reliance on electricity as a possible security concern (not to mention a burden to the environment). This is a justified concern, but current research in Optical-Proof-of-Work (otherwise called oPoW) alleviates this concern.³³ oPoW is a paradigm shift to lower operational costs (such as electricity), known as OpEx, to allocate more funds to capital expenses, known as CapEx. The desire to decrease operational costs reduces proof-of-work’s environmental impact and provides better network security. This is because an OpEx-heavy paradigm equates to miners burning the security budget by using it. Moreover, only countries with lower OpEx costs, such as electricity costs, can support proof-of-work infrastructure, thus severely increasing the barrier to entry.Being CapEx-heavy, on the other hand, means the miner’s investment protects the system by locking them into the system without burning their investment with every new block mined. Moreover, a larger cache of specialized security hardware is maintained, increasing the barrier to attack. oPow, therefore, utilizes Optical ASICS, which uses very little energy to run. Optical technology has been widely adopted for AI servers and is compatible with the hashing algorithm, the kHeavyHash, utilized by GHOSTDAG and DAGKNIGHT.It’s important to note that a CapEx paradigm does not mean it’s better to have higher CapEx costs; instead, miners can focus less on operational costs. For example, the cost of entering oPoW hardware manufacturing could be much lower³⁴ than ASICs since old Silicon Photonics, such as CMOS nodes (~90 or 220 nm vs. ~7 nm for transistors), are sufficient to create Optical ASIC mining hardware.Some may argue that ASIC mining increases centralization due to their hash power dominance over GPUs and CPUs. However, fewer entities dominating the mining industry is not, in-and-of-itself, centralization, — as the entities cannot impose non-linear “rich-get-richer effects.” This was proven in Theorem 4 for original Nakamoto Consensus in the work Bitcoin Mining Pools: A Cooperative Game Theoretic Analysis.³⁵Scalability. Nakamoto Consensus’s full potential is unlocked when it is discovered how to build it without scalability limitations, as scalability solutions simultaneously increase security. It started with GHOST utilizing subtrees to develop the heaviest chain rule to handle forking conflicts arising from the longest chain rule. However, GHOST’s security came at the expense of disallowing higher speeds; for example, GHOST cannot scale to 1-second blocks. Moreover, GHOST was still susceptible to secret chain attacks. GHOST’s speed was increased with SPECTRE utilizing BlockDAG technology and a partially synchronous model, achieving 10 blocks per second. SPECTRE is also capable of outrunning secret chain attacks.Nonetheless, SPECTRE doesn’t implement linear ordering, a property necessary for building smart contracts. GHOSTDAG resolved this issue by implementing linear ordering while maintaining strong liveness; however, linear ordering came at the expense of implementing an upper bound on the network latency time. Thus, GHOSTDAG is non-responsive to network latency, causing security vulnerabilities. DAGKNIGHT solved GHOSTDAG’s security issues by designing a parameterless version of GHOSTDAG — merging useful properties from SPECTRE and GHOSTDAG into one protocol. Nonetheless, GHOSTDAG can reach throughput levels equivalent to Visa with 3,000 transactions per second, and with DAGKNIGHT, it can do so securely.Conclusion. BlockDAG theory, as a generalization of Nakamoto Consensus, therefore, achieves high scalability. Even more so, scalability is achieved while increasing the security of original Nakamoto Consensus and maintaining its decentralization. Thus, we can say the blockchain trilemma is solved.[1] More specifically, BlockDAG theory as a generalization of Nakamoto Consensus. The goal of generalization is to preserve the key aspects of Nakamoto Consensus while also implementing new structures to increase scalability, security, or decentralization. The BlockDAG theories covered in this essay are all generalizations of Nakamoto Consensus. Moreover, it’s important to note that I will cover how the blockchain trilemma is theoretically solved at the consensus level.[2] Original Proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms were based on Nakamoto Consensus; however, Nakamoto PoS, in its naive form, suffers from the “nothing at stake” problem and long-range attacks. Due to this issue, PoS systems adopted Byzantine Fault Tolerant-style consensus, known as state-machine-replication-based PoS. For this essay, I cover PoW-style Nakamoto Consensus only.[3] Dwork, Cynthia, and Moni Naor.

FLP Impossibility was proposed by Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson, who described in their 1985 paper, Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process, that liveness and safety cannot be satisfied in asynchronous distributed systems. The CAP theorem by Eric Brewer extended the work of FLP Impossibility.[6] The invalidated transactions are re-included into a pool for future block inclusion of the correct blockchain. The excluded transactions can be automatically retransmitted and eventually be automatically included in the winning chain. For this reason, Bitcoin implemented a “coinbase cooldown,” whereby miners must wait for 100 blocks before they can spend block rewards — thus, block rewards can *not* be retransmitted, and they become invalid in a reorg.[7] In other words, when transactions within a block are considered to be ‘processed.’Moreover, the entire blockchain scalability problem can be reduced to the statement that “For a blockchain to be secure it must hold that D\u003c\u003cL” (\u003c\u003c means “much smaller”), whereby D \u003d the network delay and L \u003d the block delay.[8] Rosenfeld, Meni.

Liveness is satisfied via proof-of-work, and safety is fulfilled as the network has a bounded upper delay, denoted by the sum of all individual node delays.[15] Buterin, Vitalik. Ethereum Whitepaper, 2013, ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/.Another idea that GHOST and the Inclusive protocol framework inspired was FruitChains: A Fair Blockchain, written by Rafael Pass and Elaine Shi. These two people also influenced the work of DAGKNIGHT with their work on synchronous, partially synchronous, and asynchronous models, such as in Rethinking Large-Scale Consensus and PaLa: A Simple Partially Synchronous Blockchain.[16] Later, as Ethereum moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, a new consensus mechanism was utilized, known as Gasper, a combination of Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper-FFG) and the LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm. I will not explain how Gasper works as it isn’t relevant to the essay.[17] It’s important to note that a Tree is a restricted form of a graph and fits within the category of a DAG, utilizing the parent/child relationship. However, a child within a tree can only have one parent. A DAG, on the other hand, can have multiple parents (otherwise known as predecessors).[18] Sompolinsky, Yonatan, et al.

PHANTOM GHOSTDAG A Scalable Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus, 10 Nov. 2021, eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf[23] Given a particular block, its selected parent is the parent with the highest blue score. The entire k-cluster is not calculated when a new block is created. Instead, most of the k-cluster is inherited from the block’s parent. Thus, a block tracks those in its blue past but not in its parent’s blue past. In this sense, GHOSTDAG creates a generalization of Nakamoto Consensus since by choosing K\u003d0, the blue score is the length of the longest chain, and the selected chain is the original Nakamoto chain.[24] “Cryptocurrency Milestone: Kaspa Hits Record 10 Blocks Per Second on Testnet, Redefines Proof-of-Work Speed Standards .” Digital Journal, 27 June 2023, www.digitaljournal.com/pr/news/binary news-network/cryptocurrency-milestone-kaspa-hits-record-10-blocks-p er-second-on-testnet-redefines-proof-of-work-speed-standards.[25] In other words, implementing a hardwired bound on network latency.Parameter K can be derived from D and L — and another parameter, delta, indicating how secure you want to be. In reality, GHOSTDAG is secure against 50%-delta attacks where delta is as small as you want, but K still grows (quadratically, not exponentially like in GHOST) with delta.[26] Sutton, Michael, and Yonatan Sompolinsky. The DAG KNIGHT Protocol: A Parameterless Generalization of Nakamoto Consensus, 23 Feb. 2023, eprint.iacr.org/2022/1494.pdf[27] Until DAGKNIGHT, only partially synchronous or asynchronous models were possible under a security threshold of 33% important, as shown by Rafael Pass and Elaine Shi. DAGKNIGHT is the first permissionless parameterless consensus protocol that is secure against attackers with less than 50% of the computational power in the network.[28] Shai (Deshe) Wyborski confirmed the term PHANTOM-X via private correspondence.[29] Taken from the DAGKNIGHT White Paper as recorded through simulations by the authors.[30] A simulation of a network mining 𝜆 \u003d 3.75 blocks per second and a secret attacker with 𝛼 \u003d 0.2, the required risk parameter was set to 𝜖 \u003d 0.05.[31] However, if Bitcoin remains a store of value, then a different generalized Nakamoto Consensus cryptocurrency must prevail as a cryptocurrency intended to be used by the masses.[32] Other BlockDAG variants include Meshcash — in Tortoise and Hares Consensus: the Meshcash Framework for Incentive-Compatible, Scalable Cryptocurrencies by Iddo Bentov, Pavel Hub’aˇcek, Tal Moran, and Asaf Nadler — and OHIE in OHIE: Blockchain Scaling Made Simple by Haifeng Yu, Ivica Nikolic, Ruomu Hou, and Prateek Saxena.

It is the world’s first platform that combines three outstanding features: quantum-resistant security, compatibility with Ethereum’s EVM, and the ability to code smart contracts in any programming language.Enabled by the QAN Virtual Machine (QVM), the platform welcomes smart contract creation in a diverse array of programming languages compatible with the Linux Kernel. This approach aims to democratize access to Web3 technology, potentially drawing in more than 28 million new developers by moving beyond the traditional blockchain platforms that support only a few programming languages. QAN lowers the entry barriers for non-developers with its no-code smart contract studio, allowing users to generate smart contracts interactively within minutes.In alignment with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s primary recommendations, QANplatform incorporates CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithm into QAN XLINK. The QAN XLINK cross-signer ensures post-quantum transaction security while maintaining Ethereum EVM compatibility, safeguarding QANplatform and its users against the looming threat of quantum computing.QAN TestNet Docs: https://docs.qanplatform.com\nQANscan Blockchain Explorer: https://testnet.qanscan.com\nQAN Smart Contract Studio: https://build.qanplatform.comhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/qanplatform-quantum-resistant-blockchain-testnet— — — — —About QANplatform:QANplatform is the quantum-resistant hybrid blockchain platform that allows developers and enterprises to build quantum-resistant smart contracts and web3 solutions on top of the QAN blockchain platform in any programming language.

You know what that means, right? Story time!","title":"That Time We Burned Down Players’ Houses in Ultima Online","detailed_content":"Ultima Online is celebrating its 25th anniversary! You know what that means, right? Story time!In the spirit of #gamedev and inspired by the classic UO postmortem video by Raph Koster, et al, I thought it’d be fun to share a few stories from the middle years of Ultima Online between my time at EA Redwood Shores and Mythic Fairfax.Today’s tale: a technical teardown of burning down cheaters’ houses after finding a “criminal” ring of illegal item dupers.When Ultima Online first launched we, the players, found some bugs.By some, I mean, a lot.And the most valuable, diabolical, worth-building-a-secret-web-forum-to-trade-them sort of bug was: duping.Being able to duplicate an item, or better, a bag full of items, was the most advantageous exploit possible in the game. Better than speed-hacking, better than direct damage passthrough — even better than pre-lockdown home invasions.Some of the beta testers had a secret. Not all of us, of course, but there were certain seedy elements of the beta testing crowd that, rather than follow the virtue of Honesty, chose to hoard their knowledge of exploits rather than report them to the development team.Once UO’s beta ended and the game launched, well, suddenly the economy was hit by a wave of item duping.What was this “carefully guarded” exploit?Abusing areaserv boundaries.I still remember the first time I saw it for myself.It was 1997 and I was running around north of the orc encampment near the town of Cove when I saw some randos doing the weirdest thing ever: they were running back and forth over this annoyingly laggy patch of the game map while dropping little chests on the ground.Now, I knew this particular area as being… the worst.You see, there was this truly annoying part of the map on that dirt path between the mountains and the orc fortress that was pretty unresponsive and jerky when you walked over it.In fact, if you *ran* across it you might get “rubberbanded” — finding yourself losing a few seconds of gameplay time as you bounced back to a previous position before the server “caught up.”(Remind me to tell you all about UO’s server/client interpolation and tick-rate someday!)This was especially bad if a monster, like an inconveniently placed Orc Captain directly south of you, was chasing you and whacked you to death during your pathetically laggy attempt to flee.Imagine my surprise when these two players started excitedly yelling to each other in text (which floated over their heads) that “it worked! omgz!”Yup, they had managed to, as they excitedly bragged, figure out a trick to drop a chest on one side of the “laggy patch” while trying to pick-it-up/hand-it-over to the other player as they were both crossing from one side to the other and now each of them had a copy of the same chest: and its contents.Dupers!What I had seen was an exploit based on the “areaserv” boundaries that split up the playable gameworld of Ultima Online.UO never did anything the easy way; after all, its first generation of designers were trying things — inventing entirely new things — that later online games would simply shake their heads at and say “nah, that’s too hard.”For instance: how to load-balance thousands of players in a huge 29,360,128 meter² game map in 1997?Instead of having different “zones” with loading screens or “long, foggy mountain passes”, the UO developers just invented rectangular, seamless “sub-maps” with a (fairly!) invisible method that just let you walk from one side to the other, all while things on the other side were still visible and updating in real-time.Thus, each game server (or “shard”) you played on was actually divided into “areaservs” and there was some incredibly well-written “mirror” code that handled communicating gamestate, object conditions, and events from one side of the border to the other.But crossing those borders as a player, sometimes, was noticeably laggy.Aside: If you look at the areaserv map above you may notice that Britannia should’ve been divided up a bit more carefully so that areaserv boundaries didn’t cut through important/populated gameplay areas… look at poor Buccaneer’s Den: there’s a reason those hidden, underground tunnels were never fun to PvP in.The areaservs were essentially copying your player character and sending over a bundled message between themselves containing all your info. Once a player crossed the boundary it destroyed the old copy of the player on the initial side.And it wasn’t just players: autonomous mobile objects (mobs) like monsters, animals, and NPCs could cross them as well.(Note: for future exploits those monsters and animals also had their own backpacks/inventories players could piggyback exploit attempts on; lots of llama drama.)Naturally, any given bug with the areaserv code represented the greatest probable source of “duping” exploits, especially when coupled with purposefully manipulations of a player’s gamestate before the server backup/shutdown sequence each morning.And after I joined the UO team I learned a few things:It really felt like we were constantly on the backfoot; we couldn’t be very proactive about dupes and depended on player reports \u0026 customer service to identify egregious exploits.Then, one day I had this weird idea.There are a couple of things you have to know about UO as it was in the mid-2000’s.#2 was the biggest problem with trying to find dupes: UO’s gamestate wasn’t in a “database” — there was no way to query for player possessions or objects to find illicit goods. It was 4gbs of binary blob; the data only made sense when loaded back into the game itself.I tried though: I *wanted* to read the binary blobs. I *wanted* to give Customer Service tools to find duped or stolen items. It just wasn’t possible with the tools of the time.Then I remembered #5, and it gave me an idea for a different line of attack.Every dynamic object in UO— whether a mobile, player, or item — is capable of storing both data and scripts on themselves.Scripts don’t hold state once code execution ends, so we would store needed data in “objvars” and attach them to the same objects the scripts were attached to.The scripts themselves contained tons of “triggers” which were event handlers tied to game conditions. As I mentioned in #5 above, one of them had a name that went something like “beforeServerLoad” (heck if I remember the actual name) that specifically executed during the backup loading stage of the areaserv startup process.I thought: “What if we just *marked* the most valuable items in the game whenever they loaded from backup?”I went to the lead engineer, Supreem, and asked for just one addition to the C++ code and an associated mapping to a “Wombat func” for it: a hashing function (hello crypto!).I wanted to make the gameserv store a running list of “marked” items during the areaserv loading process to identify dupes.A global hash registry.Here’s how it worked:The idea was that if a valuable item (worthy of duping) had a unique hash stored on itself as an objvar, then the duping process — whatever it may be — would copy that same objvar’s value. Then there would be two unique objects both holding the same hash.The best time to check for this (in bulk) was during server loads, and that system marked all the objects with an “I AM DUPED” objvar.(Note: my memory may be fuzzy here, and we may have had to tie the script to the onPlayerLoad event as well; I just don’t remember if players were all loaded with the areaserv or whether they were fetched from the backup data on-demand).It was a lot like stamping the rare items with some sort of invisible ink that only fluoresced under certain conditions.So we released the updated code and let it run globally for a few weeks.And then the hunt began.Mwaha. Mwahaha. MWAHAHAHAHAHA!Within a couple of weeks we realized the first phase had worked: we had found a ton of duped rare items, and they were mostly held by the same set of player accounts across multiple game servers.Despite our excitement, this is where we paused: what do we do now?We sat down to talk with Management, Customer Service, and our Community Manager.Our producer was stoked to explain what we’d accomplished to the studio general manager. I remember sitting in the meeting with a smile on my face, pleased as punch (as only an arrogant young gamedev can be), just to hear something I wasn’t expecting:“Mmm, I don’t think deleting them all [the duped items] is a good idea, you’ll hurt too many players.”I hadn’t considered that, actually.At all.I was too excited about having accomplished my long held goal to “catch some dupers.”I wanted to chafe and say something, maybe assert that he just didn’t understand, but reined myself in and after the meeting I went back to the team and told them that we were forbidden from auto-deleting all the dupes.So we went to the CS team for data.It was true. It would’ve been a terrible idea.The dupes spread so quickly once they were created that if we just deleted them all out from under all the players who had bought them (with their hard-earned gold) from the dupers we would be affecting a significant portion of the playerbase.Sure, some of them would be fine with the “morality” of our action — but on the scale of hundreds or thousands of affected players (per shard) we were just asking for the frustration to cause a wave of quiet quitting.I really shouldn’t have been surprised by this: our studio’s general manager has been running MMOs for a lot longer than I ever had.To make matters more complicated the Customer Service team started asking us hard questions, like: “Exactly how many duped runic valorite hammers should a person have before we ban them?”Wait, we were supposed to assign an arbitrary value on how many dupes being held by one person was suspicious? Oh. Oh boy.This was harder than code. It was community design, not just game design.Thankfully, we had a level-headed community manager who was used to our over-exuberance. Honestly, they were just used to managing me whenever I got too passionate about something.“CS is going to ban them [the actual dupers] anyways. Why not make it an event?” was about how that conversation went.Well, I was the lead live events designer, so… we plotted.We identified the dupers themselves and their storage depos: they had homes full of their duped items and NPC vendors selling them to the players.The “duping ring” stretched across multiple servers, comprised of distinct groups not necessarily working together. They had all evolved the same behaviors though: making tons of UO gold from selling dupes and then selling the UO gold on secondary markets for hard cash.So Adida and I wrote a script, that, once attached to a house, would:Then, we chose a day, and struck.Customer Service mass banned the dupers on a timer, right before their associated server came online.Then we paused the gameserv/loginserv connection to those same servers and Adida and I ran around (teleported, really) to each housing location, attached the script, watched the fires erupt with joy, and moved on.We did this in batches of related servers so that each “duping ring” didn’t have time to notice they were banned and try to log in on alt-accounts to empty their houses before we could get to themConfusion! Chaos! Joy! Laughter!Discussion threads popped up on Stratics and MMORPG.com almost instantly, full of wonderings and guesses — and a few false suggestions like that a CS employee had been caught up in the banning (false!).Dozens of homes had been destroyed across the entire multiverse of Ultima Online, and the flames licking the sooty rubble were a visible testimony to our team’s determination to deal with cheaters.It felt fantastic!And we were told not to do it again.Lol.We took some flak for doing something so daringly public to cheating players — even though we made sure not to identify them to the other players directly — but still just barely skated by with upper-upper-upper management.Customer Service was instructed to use their discretion to deal with “I AM DUPED” items from then on, and honestly, by now I don’t know if anyone even remembers that the system exists (if it even does).Readers who’ve been exposed to NFTs might notice the eerie resemblance of us marking these rare items (which were non-fungible!) with unique hashes to how blockchain-based Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) work today.Ironically, one thing that our method didn’t work on was *stacks* of objects (fungible items like gold coins).But Satoshi Nakamoto solved that problem too! The first Bitcoin paper describes a perfect method (online or offline) for validating timestamped events like currency creation. It would’ve helped prevent dupes *and* ensured internal bad actors (with item creation powers) couldn’t just generate a bunch of gold to sell outside the game.Not that I’m saying MMOs need blockchains; but it turns out Proof-of-Work ledger technology had a use case here! (No wonder Amazon now offers a similar service: QLDB).Finally, one of the biggest things we learned was having to deal with the economics *after* the fire: especially when players wanted to compete for the now available, very premium, housing spots.But that’s another story.Tim “Draconi” Cotten was the lead game designer of Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss, and when he’s not writing up stories from the wild days of online gaming is working on applying all those hard-won lessons to Metaverse design.Follow him on Twitter for more Ultima related stories!","tags":[],"author":"Tim Cotten","creation_date":"2022-10-03"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/top-tier-data-scientist-this-crypto-cycle-is-your-last-chance-to-make-generational-wealth-856147d54849","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Exponential wealth is only possible in markets that are new and inefficient.","title":"Top-Tier Data Scientist: This Crypto Cycle Is Your Last Chance To Make Generational Wealth.","detailed_content":"I\u0027ve been in Crypto since 2017.I\u0027m nonchalantly strolling into my 3rd cycle with an air of confidence this time around.","tags":[],"author":"Jayden Levitt","creation_date":"2024-04-17"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@real3verseafrica/cracking-the-crypto-code-your-guide-to-profiting-in-the-digital-currency-boom-355e2f829ba4","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Unlocking Crypto Wealth: Your Path to Success in the Digital Currency Era.","title":"CRACKING THE CRYPTO CODE: YOUR GUIDE TO PROFITING IN THE DIGITAL CURRENCY BOOM .","detailed_content":"The digital gold rush is on! Cryptocurrency has taken the world by storm, attracting investors seeking high returns and a glimpse into the future of finance. But with its rapid price swings and complex terminology, the cryptoverse can feel intimidating for newcomers. Fear not, aspiring crypto trader! This guide unlocks the secrets to earning in this dynamic space, equipping you with the knowledge and strategies to navigate your path to success.Before diving in, let’s break down the fundamentals. Cryptocurrency are digital assets secured by sophisticated cryptography. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by governments, crypto operates on decentralized networks, meaning there’s no central authority pulling the strings. Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, the first and most famous, Ethereum, known for its smart contract capabilities, and Litecoin, a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin.Think of this as the stock market for crypto. You buy crypto at a lower price with the goal of selling it for a profit when the price rises. Success hinges on researching market trends, understanding technical analysis (analyzing charts and patterns to predict future prices), and making calculated decisions. Start small and learn the ropes before going all-in.This advanced strategy allows you to borrow funds from the exchange to magnify your potential profits. However, it’s a double-edged sword. You can also amplify your losses, so it’s best suited for experienced traders with a high tolerance for risk. Proceed with caution!This involves making multiple trades throughout a single day, capitalizing on short-term price fluctuations. It’s like surfing the waves of the crypto market, requiring a deep understanding of real-time movements and lightning-fast decision-making. Day trading can be lucrative, but it also carries high risks. Only jump in if you have the nerves and expertise to handle it.Here’s a passive way to earn crypto. Staking involves locking up your crypto assets in a designated pool to support a blockchain network. Think of it as lending your crypto to the network for a while. In return, you earn rewards in the form of new crypto tokens. It’s a low-risk option with good returns for long-term investors who don’t mind their crypto being tied up for a predetermined period.Similar to lending money at a bank, crypto lending allows you to lend your crypto to others through a platform and earn interest on the loaned amount. Interest rates vary depending on the platform and the borrowed crypto. It’s a good way to make your crypto work for you while someone else borrows it.This advanced strategy involves locking up your crypto in liquidity pools on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. These pools provide the necessary liquidity for crypto exchanges to function smoothly. In return for supplying liquidity, you earn high yields in the form of new tokens. However, be aware that DeFi is a complex space with inherent risks of scams and smart contract vulnerabilities.Only venture into yield farming if you fully understand the risks involved.The future of gaming is here! Play-to-earn games allow you to earn crypto tokens by playing. These tokens can be used within the game itself or cashed out for real money. It’s a revolutionary concept that combines entertainment with earning potential. However, be wary of games that seem too good to be true, as some can be scams.Some crypto projects distribute free tokens to raise awareness and attract new users. Keep an eye on reputable crypto news sources to stay updated on potential airdrops. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Do your research before participating in any airdrop.Become a crypto evangelist! Promote crypto exchanges or projects and earn commissions for every user you refer who signs up and trades. It’s a good way to earn passive income if you have a social media following or a blog dedicated to crypto.The crypto market is known for its volatility, meaning prices can swing wildly in a short period. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Start small and gradually increase your investment as you gain experience and confidence. Remember,crypto shouldn’t be your only investment strategy.Before throwing your hard-earned money at any crypto project, research it thoroughly.Here\u0027s what to dig into:Understand how the project’s technology works and what problem it solves.Who are the people behind the project? Do they have a strong track record and relevant experience?Does the project have a clear purpose and a large enough market to be successful?Cryptocurrency is digital and exists online, making it vulnerable to theft or loss. Store your crypto in a secure wallet.These are physical devices that offer the highest level of security. They’re like tiny USB drives for your crypto.These are digital wallets accessed through an app on your phone or computer. They’re more convenient but slightly less secure.Spreading your investments across different cryptocurrencies minimizes risks. Just like with traditional investment portfolios, diversification is crucial. Don’t go all-in on a single project, no matter how promising it seems.The crypto market experiences significant ups and downs. Stay patient, maintain a long-term perspective, and don’t make impulsive decisions driven by emotions. Remember, some of the most successful crypto investors bought and held for years.The world of crypto is constantly evolving. New projects, technologies, and opportunities emerge all the time. Make learning a continuous process.● Read reliable crypto news sources.\n● Follow industry experts on social media.\n● Participate in online communities and forums.\n● Take online courses or watch educational videos.Remember: Crypto is an exciting but risky market. This guide empowers you with the knowledge to make informed decisions and explore various ways to earn within the crypto-verse. Approach your journey with a cautious yet curious spirit, prioritize your financial security, and most importantly, have fun exploring the decentralized future of finance!Fear and greed are the enemies of successful crypto trading. Stick to your research, and trading plan, and don’t let emotions cloud your judgment. If you find yourself getting emotional about the market, take a step back and come back later with a clear head. By following these tips and putting in the work, you can crack the crypto code and build a sustainable path to success in this volatile market.

Jaffer, NSI Founder and Executive Director, and John Poulson, NSI Public Policy and Government Relations Manager","title":"The Crypto Correction Shows the Market Working","detailed_content":"By Jamil N. Jaffer, NSI Founder and Executive Director, and John Poulson, NSI Public Policy and Government Relations ManagerThis article originally appeared in Barron’s on September 23, 2022. Read the full piece here.This summer has seen chaos in the cryptocurrency market, with major corrections in digital currencies and key crypto institutions. Many looking at this scenario — like former Clinton-era Labor Secretary Robert Reich — believe these events highlight the need for extensive new regulation of this nascent market, including potentially treating cryptocurrencies as tradable securities. In our view, this is exactly the wrong time to be imposing massive new securities-style regulations. The result would be to strangle this new industry or worse, push it overseas.The right approach is to recognize the most recent correction for what it is: the appropriate — albeit belated — functioning of markets to address widespread overextension. The crypto market may be able to benefit from some broad regulatory guidance and basic guardrails to protect consumers and national security, but we ought not let our zeal for regulation drive this important industry into the ground.There can be little question, as many have noted, that crypto has long been dramatically overvalued relative to its fundamentals. As such, not only was the recent correction likely, but it is actually a much-needed remedy to overheated speculation. It demonstrates that traditional market mechanisms can still work well, and that the feverish increase in valuations of both cryptocurrencies and crypto companies was overblown.Crypto’s dramatic rise and disruptive impact also created challenges. The presence of unsavory early adopters — including nation-state actors bent on disinformation, hackers exploiting weak security to get paid, and those hiding illicit financing schemes by governments, terrorists, and other criminals — has sparked a valid backlash from many government officials when it comes to seeing crypto as a legitimate private store of value.However, if we do what many long-time regulators and academics like Reich and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler want — like applying ill-fitting securities laws to this new industry — we may severely stifle our nation’s ability to remain at the forefront of this transformative technology. Though there is little doubt that cryptocurrencies can, if misused, pose a critical threat to our economic and national security, it is also true that, if harnessed correctly, crypto can help maintain American leadership of free and open markets. Likewise, appropriately limited regulation can easily correct some of the excesses we’ve seen to date.To that end, Congress should initially set out a broad policy framework, ideally in bipartisan legislation, like the proposal by Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. It sets out the key policy objectives for crypto regulation, including accounting for national security issues, and seeks input from the executive branch about which agencies, if any, ought to regulate in this space and what regulatory approaches they would propose in light of the congressional policy framework. Only after setting out such a framework and getting input back from the executive branch should Congress provide detailed and narrow regulatory authority to one or more federal agencies.Such a process might be longer and more involved than usual. But it is particularly important where, as is true of crypto, there are economic, national security, and innovation imperatives that cut in a range of directions. Moreover, given the speed of evolution in the crypto industry, taking a careful, more deliberate approach to regulation, including getting significant, detailed buy-in from Congress, seems like a better path forward.To be sure, any regulation will have to address the real problems of money laundering, sanctions evasion, terrorism financing, and other criminal behavior we’ve seen in the crypto market, as well as the implications of this new technology for the traditional nation-state monopoly on monetary policy. Many of these challenges can be seen in the Treasury Department’s recent decision to sanction the virtual-currency mixing service Tornado Cash for its use in money laundering and sanctions evasion. A vigorous debate has erupted over whether the use of property-based sanctions is consistent with the law.Ensuring that crypto innovation takes place in free economies and creates more financial inclusion, rather than being hijacked by authoritarian nation-states that seek to control their own people and export repression abroad, is critically important. The open, rules-based, private-market system built by the United States and our allies is the right home for this innovation, not the lands of digital authoritarians and human rights violators.It is more critical now than ever — as the crypto industry works through the correction — that we embrace and encourage its development as a transformative capability with the potential to promote important U.S. economic and national security objectives. Of all the areas in which the government might regulate, this is one where a strong bias in favor of innovation and against rash action is key.Jamil N.

It reveals how the earliest single-celled organisms swimming about in a sea of molecules began to compete—not intentionally but through the process of natural selection. Those that managed to thrive in their environment were more likely to propagate their genes, meaning their offspring would represent a higher percentage of the gene pool and would, in turn, have a higher chance of spreading their own genes through the same cycle.At its core, natural selection can only occur if four fundamental conditions are true: First, an organism must be able to pass on its genes (“heredity”). Second, that reproductive process must over time introduce differences into the gene pool, such as through mutation (“variation”). Third, the environment in which the organisms live must have limited resources necessary for survival (“scarcity”). Fourth, there cannot be any higher authority dictating how it plays out (“no oversight”). The rules of the game are the rules of physics, chemistry, and biology, and nothing but the interactions of organisms without a governing body determine who wins the battle for survival. This fourth condition is not often cited as a prerequisite for natural selection (whereas the other three typically are), but I believe it to be just as important.In the human-made digital world, there are also “organisms”. Just like all other living things, they run on hardware (computers instead of bodies, made of transistors instead of cells) and execute their own software (machine code instead of DNA).And furthermore, there have long been analogies in the digital world to the first two prerequisites of natural selection. Heredity is achieved every time executable code is copied. And variation takes place every time executable code is modified, be it by a human, a computer, or another external force.Yet now, seemingly for the first time, the third and fourth conditions—scarcity and no oversight—exist as well. The advent of blockchain technology permits digital assets to be limited in number and to have their distribution enforced by the ecosystem rather than any single gatekeeper. While most of the focus on Web3 today views it as a technology of interest in its own right, there is a different perspective that is worth exploring: that it is a means to an end, a platform for enabling other phenomena to develop. Just as the scarce resources needed to sustain life are the mechanism that allows lifeforms both to propagate and to compete, it is theoretically possible to use the blockchain in the same way: to allow software both to propagate and to compete.I want to focus for a minute on that fourth requirement of natural selection, the no oversight piece, which we should just call decentralization. Just as the “invisible hand of the market” is simply the emergence arising from many individual self-serving components (i.e. buyers and sellers) interacting, life too is an entirely decentralized phenomenon. There is no authority dictating who survives and thrives. It is the environment. It is the collective emergent outcome of all interaction within that environment.In the Web3 digital world, the environment is called the blockchain. And by satisfying the four requirements for natural selection mentioned above, one could theoretically recreate the type of collective emergent outcome we see in biology.By establishing a core set of rules (enforced through smart contracts, for instance), software can take the form of organisms in this new world (let’s call them Cryptorganisms for the purposes of this discussion) and effectively compete for the scarce resources available on the blockchain. Each instance of software can be, like any living thing, self-serving and seeking to survive and reproduce. And as each genealogy of software develops, it improves not just in isolation but in its desperate attempt to out-compete all of the other software in the environment.(A quick aside: If you’re enjoying this article, please consider subscribing to my free weekly newsletter, Z-Axis, by clicking here!)It’s worth exploring one possible real-world example of this Blockchain Darwinism. This is intended purely as a thought experiment, a starting point.Imagine a newly minted digital asset I’ll call Charliecoin (after Darwin, of course). Like most cryptocurrencies, Charliecoin is limited in supply. While Charliecoin can be traded or transferred, it cannot be bought, sold, or converted to another form.Each day, new Charliecoins are minted, but the quantity of the new supply is entirely unpredictable. One day, 72,000 new coins might be minted. Then for a week, there might be none (a drought of sorts). This would simulate the unpredictable conditions of a hostile habitat where the availability of life-sustaining resources fluctuates erratically.Anyone can create Cryptorganisms, which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that have smart contracts conforming to certain rules. These rules represent the biological rules of the system. For instance, they specify how many Charliecoins a Cryptorganism needs to survive so that it doesn’t “die”.On top of that infrastructure, gaming mechanics can be built. Developers can define ways for Cryptorganisms to interact with each other. Perhaps one such “game” permits two Cryptorganisms to battle for a winner-take-all wager of some Charliecoins. Perhaps another permits two Cryptorganisms to “reproduce” and defines the (somewhat random) process by which their offspring NFT gets defined.Two financial incentives could exist for human “players” to participate in the development and growth of the ecosystem. First, a holder of a Charliecoin can earn actual money (whether in the form of cash or other cryptocurrency) for every day they hold it; therefore, there is a driver for growth of one’s Charliecoin stash which, by virtue of getting consumed to sustain “life”, will otherwise eventually be depleted. Second, a developer can earn actual money (again, either cash or cryptocurrency) every time one of their “games” is played between two Cryptorganisms; therefore, there is a driver to continue innovating on top of the platform.Writing about this idea made me think of the phenomenon of robot combat TV shows that emerged in the late 90s, like Robot Wars and Battlebots. What I find interesting about this concept is that it enables a type of “Game of Life” platform to exist that does not actually allow human beings to compete directly. Instead, they must innovate on the abilities of software (in the form of Cryptorganisms) to be their proxies for competition.And what would come out of this endeavor? Perhaps nothing more than an entertaining way to watch two robots engage in semi-autonomous combat. Or, perhaps, by watching this world unfold on the blockchain, it will help us move just a little bit closer towards a broader understanding of how life came to exist and evolve in the real world.P.S. I used the phrase “Game of Life” earlier. This whole concept is, in many ways, inspired by the work of John Conway and his Game of Life. In Conway’s version, there are zero players, and the game evolves organically without human intervention. In this version however, the game only evolves through human intervention.If you enjoyed this article, please consider subscribing to my free weekly newsletter, Z-Axis, by clicking here!","tags":["Web3","Cryptocurrency","Blockchain","Blockchain Technology","Startup"],"author":"Nir Zicherman","creation_date":"2022-07-25"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@NOW_Blockchain/airdrop-ambassador-program-x-engage-io-5a7445137c4b","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Greetings NOW followers,","title":"Airdrop \u0026 Ambassador Program x Engage IO","detailed_content":"HOW TO JOIN \u0026 HOW IT WORKS?First, you need to join our Discord, all of the tasks and rewards will appear on our Discord server.After that, you can connect your Twitter account to our server, simply navigate to the #🤖・commands channel and type the command /set twitter, followed by your Twitter ID to link your account and start and earning points.Stay updated with daily tasks: We post engaging tasks on Twitter daily.

Can web5 be the answer?","title":"I’m not a robot (but, are you?)","detailed_content":"It’s 2022 and we are living in the opening scene of a dystopian Black Mirror episode.The line between what is real and what is fake has already blurred. The line between who is real and who is fake is now rightfully getting much more attention. It’s all over the daily news:Sure, while it’s still easy to tell it is not actually Björn shimmying on stage, it is becoming increasingly impossible to tell the humans from the robots. I mean, what will happen once machines become better at us at correctly identifying the three images of the 9-square grid image that contain traffic lights? Then what?As actual humans, we better protect ourselves before the bots learn how to optimize for their own rights and self-interest.Whether bluffing in an online poker table, taking on a troll in an online forum, or chasing an avatar on your Peloton, I think we have a right to know with certainty if our adversaries are man or machine.Where is the line?Bots beings bots is no issue. It goes wrong when bots masquerade as human life forms. It’s iffy, but still not too creepy, when an artificially intelligent chatbot answers basic customer support questions. But when algorithms deliberately misrepresent themselves as an actual human, without disclosure — this crosses a bright line.Consider that researchers at UC Berkeley and Lancaster University have learned that fake human faces can be reliably constructed to be seen as more trustworthy than actual faces.As humans, we are heavily influenced by “social proof” (hat tip AileenLee) — the intuitive behavior that when we see others doing or saying something, we give it (sometimes unwarrented) credence — by outsourcing the due-diligence to others.Social proof is powerful, and explains why Brits love to join a queue, even when they have no idea what it’s for.Social proof is why eBay auctions with more bids attract new bidders (start your auctions at $0.01, people), why startups with existing investors more easily get follow on investors, and so on.Social proof works well when the proof is from real humans. But it is a social disaster when huge numbers of bots parrot a false narrative to manufacture artificial confidence by manipulating our instinct to trust the wisdom of crowds.If so many people are saying so? It must be true.In March, the BBC reported a discovery that 75 Twitter accounts managed by the Kremlin use a so-called “astroturfing” playbook where legions of bot accounts amplify constructed narratives through a coordinated network of millions of fake accounts retweeting fake news: “75 Russian government Twitter profiles which, in total, have more than 7 million followers. The accounts have received 30 million likes, been retweeted 36 million times and been replied to 4 million times.”Let’s be realistic though. We can’t expect the bots to identify themselves as such. Instead, it will have to be the other way around: we must find a way for humans to authenticate as human, and demonstrate proof we are actually real.As a European resident, I benefit from the culture, policy, and technology that is invested into protecting personal privacy. Legislation like the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) protects consumers like me from unwarranted data collection and over-reaching tracking, and offers defense against a tsunami of invasions of personal privacy both online and off.European legislators believe humans have a right to own their own privacy, and have even made law “the right to be forgotten” which provides humans a legal mechanism to be deleted from databases and delete all personally identifiable tracking data.I agree with the principle that individuals should have full control over their personal identification and their own privacy — revealing what they choose to in exchange for convenience, personalization, or relevance.While humans have the right to protect personal privacy, we’ve also learned that humans acting anonymously creates toxicity in our lack of accountability. One need only browse social media to see trolls emboldened by their anonymity as they post from their parents’ basement. Newsweek describes anonymous trolling as the “online disinhibition effect.” Yet, online bullies so-often stand down and de-escalate in non-anonymous face-to-face interactions.Anonymity in public forums (Reddit, Twitter, YouTube) has clearly accelerated social polarization where humans take extreme positions in order to maximize attention, earn social currency, and ultimately manipulate the social narrative. And, while we think anonymous humans act badly: the bots are much worse.Online forums which encourage non-anonymous participation has the modulating effect: amplifying actual human voices, while sidelining and discrediting the anonymous fringe. Yelp, in it’s earliest days, deliberately seeded local communities with real locals, initially paying freelance writers to post real reviews in their own voices, using their actual first name and last initial. The subsequent community that joined, followed their lead, using their own personal names as their handle, and being thoughtful with a more nuanced critique. Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms also utilize authentication (example: blue tick on Twitter) to various effect — offering credibility to authenticated human contributors, which in turn counterbalances the hyperbolic content contributed by those who hide behind anonymity. Tl;dr — being non-anonymous results in more moderate behavior.We didn’t use to worry too much about infiltration of fake humans into our lives. The technology wasn’t there, and our intrinsic ability to detect fakes was until now, mostly good enough. But, the technical barriers to creating unlimited fake human profiles online are gone. The cost to creating millions of fake digital profiles is negligible, while the possible destruction such profiles can cause has become suddenly unfathomable.Skeptical? Look no further than the risk of even perceived voting fraud, let alone the devastation of actual voting fraud.We suddenly face a toxic cocktail concocted of very alarming ingredients:This might not end well.At the very least, we must find a way to securely, privately, and non-anonymously create a trustworthy credential that authenticates each of us as human.Ideally a non-anonymous human authentication with fully controllable individual privacy settings secured by a trusted neutral party.Wait, what? There’s a lot to unpack here, so let’s take it one concept at a time.At financial institutions (banks) everywhere around the world, there are common and often legally required fraud-abatement practices called KYC (“know your customer”) whenever customers open new accounts. The process involves passports, drivers’ licenses, utility bills, birth certificates, and a combination of other official documentation assures the bank that (a) you are a real person, and (b) you are who you say you are. Banks require this authentication to manage their risk.These same KYC principles are needed for online platforms and services.Welcome to New Social Media Corp. To activate your account, either scan and submit four forms of ID, or simply authenticate with your HumanID.Consumers should only have to share and provide personal information that they choose to — and will generally want to share only as much as is needed, but not more.Imagine a hierarchical graduated pyramid of personal information starting at the lowest level (“Level 0”) — which asserts you are an actual unique human being — gradually cascading to age, gender, nationality, home address, billing information, tax ID, medical conditions, all the way to (gasp!) genetic code (“Level 999”).For example, upvoting posts on a public forums on a might only require “Level 0” authentication (twixbar2967 is an authenticated human being) while getting a quote for car insurance might require “Level 17” (fordfan4957 is 32-year-old male with a high school diploma, married, living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, one speeding ticket, two fender benders, 14 years of driving experience).Fully controllable individual privacy settings means that while the data has been authenticated as real by the 3rd party, the access to the content is controlled by the individual who reveals it only for his/her personal benefit — and only at their own discretion.This is perhaps the hardest piece of the puzzle to crack. Who on Earth is trusted enough to play this role? The big four accounting firms? The Swiss government? Big tech? None of the above?This is where the power of blockchain technologies may really meet its promise — as a public and unalterable ledger can act as a single source of truth. Take away the need for a trusted 3rd party at all.And just this week, tech pioneer\nJack Dorsey\n(Twitter, Block) announced his so-called “web5” ambitions along exactly these lines.The announcement website makes it plain: “The web democratized the exchange of information, but it’s missing a key layer: identity.”I welcome such an unalterable record that can protect my rights as authenticated human over the rights of the non-authenticated, while protecting my personal privacy, and putting me back in control.We need this.There are so many doubts and questions. It’s really early to predict where this goes. But, the need is clear, and the technology exists.What’s now needed is great execution of a set of neutrally governed systems which will truly puts the users (me and you) back in control of who we are and what we share.I guess that makes me a human endorser of web5.I’m not a robot.Thank you for reading. I’d love to hear your thoughts. Is web5 the answer? Better ideas? Comments welcome: Humans only.Follow me? Don’t really care if you’re a bot.","tags":[],"author":"Brad Porteus","creation_date":"2022-06-22"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@gaingain/how-to-make-600-daily-on-pump-fun-consistently-not-clickbait-304ecff5e3b8","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"In recent weeks, I have been using a platform that allows for considerable profits even with a small initial investment. Today, I want to…","title":"HOW TO MAKE $600 DAILY ON PUMP.FUN CONSISTENTLY(not clickbait)","detailed_content":"Pump.fun is a dynamic platform where cryptocurrency tokens can be launched and traded, but navigating it requires a certain level of understanding and strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how it works and some tips on how to use it effectively.At its core, Pump.fun operates by listing “Bump orders.” Each time a token is bought or sold, it gets bumped to the front page. This rapid movement can create a chaotic and overwhelming experience, making it difficult to track or invest in tokens solely based on their visibility on the homepage.Instead, a more strategic approach involves sorting tokens by their creation time. This allows users to identify newly launched tokens, which are typically listed sequentially with the most recent launches at the top. Many of these tokens may not see significant activity immediately but monitoring them can offer early investment opportunities.The platform’s structure can encourage rapid buying and selling, often leading to significant price fluctuations. Understanding the developer’s initial investment (dev buy) is crucial as it can indicate the level of confidence the creator has in the token. Tokens with unusually high initial buys from developers might be riskier, as they can lead to substantial sell-offs.When trading on Pump.fun, setting a high slippage (around 50%) is advised to ensure transactions go through during periods of high volatility.However, this also means you might pay more than intended due to price changes during the transaction.While Pump.fun offers mechanisms that reduce the risk of ‘rug pulls’ — where developers abruptly withdraw all funds from a project — caution is still necessary. The platform ensures liquidity is locked and controlled by the system, not by the developers, which prevents them from draining the funds. However, investors should still perform due diligence and monitor the token’s activity closely before investing.To successfully invest on Pump.fun, consider the following steps:Why do I say this? Based on countless trading experiences, 99% of projects will experience a significant drop after hitting Raydium, possibly falling by 50% or more.It’s advisable to secure your initial capital and some profit before that happens. If you have a lot of confidence in the project, you can consider buying back in at a lower price after it launches on Raydium to maximize profits.The trading bot I personally use is “Photon” and using my referral link can save you 10% on transaction fees.https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/@gaingainA common strategy to gain an advantage on Pump.fun is through the use of trading bots, such as the Photon bot. These bots are designed to automate the trading process, enabling users to enter and exit trades more swiftly than manually navigating the platform. The bot can be particularly useful for keeping up with new launches and reacting quickly to market changes.2. Real-Time Monitoring: Unlike the native Pump.fun interface that updates every five minutes, trading bots can monitor changes by the second. This capability is crucial for capturing the most accurate market movements and responding instantly.3. Transaction Execution: When you decide to buy a token, simply set your desired amount and execute a “quick buy” through the bot. This process bypasses slower manual entries and helps secure your position at an optimal price.To start trading, you’ll need to fund your bot’s wallet. This is usually a straightforward process where you transfer cryptocurrency (like Solana) directly into the bot’s wallet. Once funded, there are several settings to adjust:While bots can enhance your trading capabilities by executing orders quickly, they are not a guarantee of profit. Effective use of trading bots requires understanding the market, knowing when to enter or exit a position, and accepting the risks associated with high-speed trading. It’s also vital to avoid impulsive decisions based on the bot’s speed and to ensure that each trade aligns with a well-considered strategy.Gaining significant returns on investments in platforms like Pump.fun involves more than just quick trades. It requires a deep understanding of the projects you invest in to avoid losses. Here’s how seasoned traders do it using pre-launch groups to identify promising tokens before they hit the market.Pre-launch groups, typically found on messaging platforms like Telegram, are communities where information about upcoming token launches is shared. By joining these groups, investors can get early access to buy links and other crucial launch details. However, merely joining these groups isn’t enough. Here’s a more effective strategy:With the prevalence of scams in the crypto world, it’s crucial to be vigilant. Here are some tips to help you identify whether a pre-launch group and its associated token might be worth the investment:Even with all the right tools and information, investing in crypto projects involves inherent risks. Here are some best practices to follow:For example, suppose I decide to use 10 SOL to practice trading on Pump.fun. I would only invest 0.5 SOL in each project and would cautiously invest in those that seem reliable after analysis.This approach significantly increases the success rate, and as long as a few projects are profitable, the earnings will cover the initial 10 SOL.Navigating Pump.fun and leveraging its features requires a blend of strategic planning, technological assistance, and cautious optimism. By understanding the platform’s mechanics, utilizing trading bots for efficiency, and engaging with pre-launch groups for insider knowledge, traders can significantly enhance their chances of making successful trades.However, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency trading on platforms like Pump.fun demands vigilance and a disciplined approach to risk management. It’s crucial to perform due diligence, stay informed about market trends, and assess each project thoroughly before investing. Remember, while the potential for substantial gains exists, so does the risk of significant losses.Ultimately, success on Pump.fun comes down to combining technology with smart trading practices and continuously adapting to the fast-paced crypto environment. By following these guidelines, traders can navigate Pump.fun more confidently and potentially achieve consistent profitability in their trading endeavors.","tags":[],"author":"Gain Gain Crypto"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@ashonweb3/ram-and-rams-on-eos-informed-inscription-conversion-0f647fd16353","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Tweet","summary":"There are just over five days remaining to convert your RAMS inscriptions (or have them automatically destroyed, releasing RAM back to…","title":"RAM and RAMS on EOS — Informed Inscription Conversion","detailed_content":"There are just over five days remaining to convert your RAMS inscriptions.

This is not financial advice, do your own research.EOS RAM is an EOS system resource that is used to store data on the blockchain. It is sold on the EOS RAM marketplace and is priced based on the Bancor liquidity algorithm. On December 17, 2023 an msig proposal was passed to stop RAM inflation on EOS, making it a finite resource at 390GB. The EOS community has been cumulatively experiencing the full range of emotions due to the changes that have been occurring over the past several months (the RAM price chart).There are some major changes to EOS tokenomics being proposed and one of the major focal points of this proposal is a large allocation to the EOS RAM market. You can read more about the tokenomics proposal in this article.Some high level (RAM-relevant) takeaways from this proposal:\n- 35M EOS to be used to purchase RAM from the system’s Bancor pool to support or fund various EOS Ecosystem initiatives.\n- 315M EOS to be lent out to professional market makers who will acquire RAM from the Bancor pool and the open market.In order to make an informed decision on whether or not to convert your inscription to RAMS tokens (releasing the RAM to the DAO) or to reclaim the RAM to your account (and burn the RAMS tokens) it is important to consider the following information.Who is the RAMS DAO?\nThe RAMS project was incubated by EOS Labs.Current RAMS holders can be seen here. Notable RAMS Whales include EOS Network Foundation (admin.grants) and EOS Labs (eoslabs.eco).RAMS DAO multi-signature group consists of: EOS Labs, BP Defibox, BP EOSNation, Labs member rams.base and Labs member Startship.eos.How much RAM?\nIf all RAMS tokens were created, then the RAMS DAO would manage 46GB of RAM (out of the finite 390GB supply on EOS). You can check the RAMS DAO account information here to see how much RAM the DAO currently manages.RAMS Token\nRAMS serves as the governance token of the RAMS DAO.

Communication is poor, basic functions are not smooth, expensive mistakes are easily made and trust is easily lost.We have about a year before the next bitcoin halving/ bull cycle in which to alleviate this pain.To that end, I’m writing a series on the crypto product areas I think are in most urgent need of attention.This one will focus on decentralized applications (dApps).Let’s get into it.Usually the most important CTA on any dApp is the Connect Wallet button.But with the constant stream of news about crypto scams and hacks, people are understandably anxious about losing their assets by accidentally connecting to the wrong dApp.Currently, no dApp that I’m aware of does anything to help allay that fear and instill trust.Let’s improve this situation by communicating some information about the platform that might help people feel safer about connecting.Such as:There could be other things you might want to flex here but you get the idea.Other things:Another easy one that surprisingly few dApps offer is support for a variety of different wallets.While Metamask is by far the most popular wallet for ERC20 tokens and all the other tokens that reside on EVM compatible chains, there are others.And the list seems to keep growing. Even Robinhood is now getting into the non-custodial wallet game.Rainbow offers a nice configurable plugin for a Connect Wallet button which pops up a modal that has all the wallets.Out of the box, this is far better than the standard offering you usually see of Metamask, WalletConnect and maybe one or two others.But I would recommend customizing it for the needs of your target audience and to match the style of your dApp.Like other banking and finance apps, dApps that facilitate transactions provide a confirmation screen which summarizes the details of the desired action and asks the user to confirm.More often than not, these screens completely miss the mark.Unless you’re a crypto developer, you probably don’t understand jargon like GWEI and Royalties.These terms are confusing at best. At worst, they make users feel like they’re getting mugged by hidden fees.Include the specific action in the title, put the most important information at the top and include the maximum amount of detail underneath.We don’t need to eliminate the jargon completely, but use this opportunity to educate people on crypto terms.The example above is specifically for sending crypto and includes details that are specific to that action. But confirmation screens are used for a HUGE variety of tasks, not necessarily even financial.It may just be a signature required to change a minor thing or to grant additional permissions to the dApp.The details on the confirmation screen must be tailored to the task.Do not show “Amount: 0, Gas: 0, Royalty: 0, Total: 0” if the action is to update permissions.Once you confirm the transaction, that’s often where things really go downhill. We expect crypto payments to be nearly instant but depending on the chain, they can be quite slow.The amount of information conveyed on a transaction status screen varies a lot between different dApps.Sometimes this is for technical reasons. An increasing number of crypto platforms do not actually custody assets themselves, but instead use custodial services like Fireblocks.Fireblocks does not currently relay any on-chian transaction data through their API other than transaction status (pending, cancelled or complete). And even that info is not in a format that updates automatically (you need to refresh the page to see if the status changed).Lame.However, there are innovative solutions to this problem. For example, BitPay built a monitoring client that senses any blockchain transaction on one of their wallets and relays all the data in a webhook. And it’s open source.This is not a small piece or work, but even dApps using third party custody services like Fireblocks could implement it in order to show users a detailed transaction status.So basically, no excuse.Remember how much info was conveyed when you downloaded a file over dial-up internet on Windows95?TMI? I actually don’t think so.If your transfer status screen is a half-ass effort, you need to fix it immediately.I have seen the help desk messages that people write when they are feeling that pit deep in their stomach when they think they may have lost their funds. And they are not okay.dApps do not typically have help desks.All the more reason to get this right.There should never, ever be any doubt as to what’s happening with a transaction.Transaction status may include:On February 19th, Twitter started blowing up with claims that people were getting their NFTs transferred out of their wallets without permission or sold for very low prices.The exploit coincided with with an OpenSea contract migration, wherein they sent out an official email with instructions for NFT creators on the platform to manually migrate their collections.Apparently, the exploiter basically copied OpenSea’s email template and sent it out with a link to a spoofed website with a malicious contract.At the time though, no one understood what was happening.Fearing the worst, NFT influencers started circulating threads on how to disconnect your wallet from OpenSea and revoke token approvals, something most people had no clue how to do.Some were going a step further and saying that any wallet that had ever been connected to OpenSea was at risk and that everyone should create a brand new wallet, pay the gas (which of course was insanely high at that moment), and transfer everything they had.Luckily, the extent of the damage was pretty quickly identified.It was bad, but not as bad as people had feared.I’m not sure how many events like this its going to take for us make the disconnect button a standard feature of all dApps.Security imperative 🔐I said “empower users” above because this not solely about user experience.There are principles at stake here that will be won or lost in the details.Easily disconnecting from dApps (AKA revoking access to your data) is one of the great promises of Web3 and represents a core ideological tenant of the movement.As more and more data becomes tied to blockchains, more and more dApps will be built to facilitate access to that data and do interesting things with it.This in turn will grow the amount of data on chain and power the next wave of the internet.But only if people can trust the system.And we have a lot of work to do on that front.___Thanks for reading until the end.

From a technical standpoint, it will explore the “what” of LayerZero V2, including its design, security, and trust assumptions. From a discussion standpoint, it will also attempt to rationalize the “why” of LayerZero through a general analysis of the core principles of the protocol and an exploration of the ramifications of V2 on other interop solutions.Here is an outline of the article:What Is LayerZero?How Does V2 Work?LayerZero and the MarketClosing ThoughtsDepending on who you are — your job, your portfolio, your education, your predilection for memes — how you understand LayerZero will likely differ. It’s the same way with most crypto primitives. For instance, a financial manager, an Uber driver, and your grandmother will likely have different definitions for what Bitcoin is. In that example, Bitcoin is probably something akin to digital gold, an investment, or darknet money that is used by criminals, respectively.With that in mind, having a single definition for LayerZero seemingly defeats the purpose. Here are a few different ways to explain LayerZero, curated to a few of the most likely readers of this piece:For the whitepaper enthusiasts:Utilizing an immutable endpoint, append-only verification modules, and fully configurable verification infrastructure, LayerZero provides the security, configurability, and extensibility necessary to achieve omnichain interoperability. LayerZero enforces strict application-exclusive ownership of protocol security and costs through its novel trust-minimized modular security framework designed to support all blockchains and use cases universally. Omnichain applications (OApps) built on the LayerZero protocol achieve frictionless blockchain-agnostic interoperation through LayerZero’s universal network semantics.For the nerds:LayerZero is a verification agnostic transport layer that enables smart contracts on different blockchains to interoperate. It is a fully connected mesh network not bound to any infrastructure or blockchain. LayerZero is an “omnichain” protocol enabling developers to build unified applications with modular security parameters.For the web3 developers:LayerZero is an immutable, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol connecting previously siloed blockchains. Using LayerZero, developers can send arbitrary messages across chains while preserving complete control over their application’s security. LayerZero enables developers to create and configure unified applications, tokens, and data primitives, regardless of chain. This concept of unified cross-chain development is encapsulated in the word “omnichain” and is what LayerZero envisions the future of crypto moving towards.For the technology enthusiasts:LayerZero is to blockchains what TCP/IP is to the internet. Where TCP/IP allows different computers running different operating systems on different networks to communicate (resulting in a connected internet), LayerZero enables smart contracts coded in different languages on different blockchains to communicate. This allows developers to create applications that exist universally across blockchains.For your TradFi friend who you thought understood but clearly didn’t:Imagine your Windows computer couldn’t send an email to your boss’s Mac, or your Android phone couldn’t send a text message to your mother’s iPhone. We take this for granted, but it’s all powered by a communication protocol named TCP/IP that glues the Internet together. LayerZero is that communication protocol, but for blockchains. Before LayerZero, Ethereum couldn’t communicate with Bitcoin, and neither blockchain could communicate with Solana. With LayerZero, developers and users can interact with applications and tokens that exist on many blockchains through a single protocol, similar to how Mac, Linux, and Windows users can all communicate across the same Internet (early alpha: LZ + Solana, coming in 2024).For the dinner table at Thanksgiving:LayerZero is like the Internet, which opened up communication to the world — email, social media, zoom calls, etc. LayerZero will do that, but for crypto — meaning finance will be open, with anybody able to move value, take out loans, trade assets, etc, without going through an intermediary like a bank or a potential censor like a government.It is important to remember why we are here — to build an open and just digital economy for all people, for all time. Crypto is a space that should be permissionless, allowing anyone to interact with applications. Crypto should be censorship-resistant, facilitating the movement of data packets without judgment. Crypto should exist forever, leaving behind systems that are immutable and provable, unchanging. In general, it is pertinent that the protocol to connect crypto is designed to combat corruption so that whatever we are building in this space may stay parallel to the legacy system rather than become part of it.LayerZero’s design mirrors these core principles.Endpoints (the interface for interacting with LayerZero) exist as immutable smart contracts on each chain LayerZero supports. These are non-upgradeable and cannot be changed by any party, providing a safe and predictable interface to interact with. Every piece of core protocol code is non-upgradable. Neither LayerZero Labs nor anyone else besides the owner of the omnichain application has the ability to change an application’s security configuration (unless Defaults or a delegate is selected to do so).Individual messages can only be executed once all previous messages have been verified, meaning no individual message can ever be censored on any pathway. There is no ability for the LayerZero protocol to selectively deliver messages once they’re successfully submitted on the source chain. If a transaction is successfully submitted on the source chain, it is guaranteed to be delivered to the destination chain.LayerZero is a pure protocol. Anyone can run the infrastructure that verifies and executes messages sent via LayerZero. If every developer and infrastructure provider stopped performing services, anybody could come in to join the protocol and pick up right where they left off. Furthermore, anyone may build on top of LayerZero and interact with those applications.The core design of LayerZero V2 can be bucketed into three categories: protocol, standards, and infrastructure.Protocol → These aspects of LayerZero protocol remain the same across every supported blockchain. In the V2 whitepaper, the protocol of LayerZero is what is deemed “intrinsic” — these are the contracts that will last forever (immutable), that anybody may build on top of (permissionless) and that enforces how transactions are ordered (censorship-resistant). The protocol comprises two entities, Endpoints and MessageLibs.Standards → These enable the concept of “unified semantics” — where an application/token works the same across every LayerZero-supported blockchain. Unified semantics enable developers to easily build interfaces that interact with applications across tens of blockchains without having to rewrite code for new environments. LayerZero standards include how omnichain smart contracts are written, how data packets are structured, and how logic is composed. Anything a developer might need to launch an omnichain product from scratch can be found as audited, reusable, and battle-tested standards.While these design patterns may not seem like a big deal, design patterns are the legos for building omnichain applications and help developers create slick user experiences. For example, tokens can be bridged and swapped through a composed AB in a single transaction that only requires gas on the source chain.Infrastructure → The infrastructure layer of LayerZero is built to be permissionless: anybody can run the entities necessary to both verify and execute transactions. The infrastructure stack is also built to be completely modular — applications can choose what type of verification method it wants to use, along with what entities they want to pay for execution.The goal of V2 is not to completely overhaul a system. Instead, it is to take the V1 design and emphasize focus on the core principles of LayerZero: permissionless, censorship-resistant, and immutable.The following five changes from V1 to V2 improve the developer experience and harden LayerZero’s core principles.V2 vs V1 highlights:Let’s expand on X/Y/N and Security Stacks, as these are probably the most important concepts to understand when building on V2.X of Y of N allows an application developer to designate a quorum of DVNs to check the integrity of a cross-chain message before signing off on a message’s validity. For example, “1 of 9 of 15” requires consensus from the following DVNs for a message to be verified:Regarding the required signer aspect of X of Y of N — this allows applications to harden their verification significantly by running their own DVN and requiring themselves to sign off on each transaction. That way, even if other DVNs collude to sign a malicious transaction, their application would be safe.X of Y of N is the core of the Security Stack, allowing applications to select, combine, and/or remove DVNs to verify messages however they deem fit. This lets applications improve security as new verification methods enter the market or reconfigure DVNs if risks arise.Security Stacks should generally be configured based on a project’s use case. For example, a cross-chain lending dApp may configure its Security Stack to the most decentralized set of DVNs possible and set a high number of blocks for confirmation, while a financial institution building an ecosystem of subnets may choose to run its own DVNs in its Security Stack with very minimal confirmation time. For inexpensive use cases or testing, developers can set a 1/1/1 quorum. However, if someone were to build an application that moved millions in value across chains sporadically, a quorum of 5/20/25 DVNs might be used.Security Stack flexibility benefits the developer because it future-proofs an OApp by not locking it into a single verification method. If, for example, a DVN were to go down due to a hack or government subpoena, an OApp could change its Security Stack to require a signature from a different DVN.This unbiased stance on verification is a design choice that differs from most other messaging protocols, which often offer only a single security configuration. Outside of IBC, Hyperlane, and a few others… most cross-chain protocols adopt a shared approach to security, continually updating a single, monolithic end-to-end security model (like a validator set, oracle, middlechain, etc) to include new chains.A one-size-fits-all approach to security will often lead to applications under or overpaying for security. For example, an omnichain NFT project has much lower security needs than an omnichain money market. However, if both are built on a middle-chain-enabled cross-chain protocol, they pay the same amount for security. In addition, using a single monolithic protocol leads to a one-size-fits-all approach to extensibility, as each verification method may only support a limited number of chains. With a modular set of DVNs, LayerZero allows developers to configure security parameters that best suit their application rather than forcing them to fit an application into a rigid, monolithic architecture.In building out Security Stacks, a diverse range of opinions is expected regarding the security of an application. There will be some proponents that say a Security Stack with just one DVN is enough (those would be developers currently building on single middle-chains), while others might say that anything less than a 1 required, 4/5 Security Stack is insecure. Whatever might be said, LayerZero protocol is unopinionated — it is only the transport layer and will stay verification agnostic.With Security Stacks, LayerZero is the antithesis of vendor lock-in, as it allows developers to choose, modify, and combine different types of verification methods based on their specific use case.For this example, let us assume that an application (OApp) has configured its Security Stack on the LayerZero Endpoint for both the source and destination blockchains. It has also selected its preferred version of MessageLib.Step 1a: Sending the MessageStep 1b: Encoding and Emitting the Packet:Step 2: Verification by DVNs:Step 3: Receipt and Execution:LayerZero is a big idea — anything that can be programmed as a smart contract on a single chain can now be natively programmed across multiple chains (which leads to far more expressive applications being built than what currently exists on the single-chain market).Since inception, many products have been built on LayerZero, including borrow/lend dApps, cross-chain identity dApps, bridges, NFT marketplaces, enterprise projects, NFT projects, meme tokens, and data products. Over 40,000 OApp contracts are deployed on LayerZero V1, 100s of teams are using LayerZero to power OFTs, and dozens of teams have built full-scale applications as groupings of OApps.For developers, LayerZero composability extends DeFi beyond single-chain limitations, paving the way for a more interconnected and versatile financial ecosystem. With LayerZero, the scope of applications built in DeFi expands as developers leverage more assets and blockchains. Furthermore, with the ability to run a DVN, application developers can harden security by decreasing reliance on other parties.For users, V2 simplifies cross-chain transactions, allowing them to interact with multiple blockchains without even knowing — as they only have to pay for gas on the source chain. This streamlined experience can be adopted across every DeFi vertical — from DEXs to yield farms to NFT marketplaces — reducing the complexity for end-users. The endgame for retail DeFi is to completely abstract the chain away from users, and LayerZero OApp and OFT contracts are tools to facilitate this.To give a concrete idea of what can be built with V2, here are a few examples of applications leveraging LayerZero V2…There is no such thing as a perfect system. Anybody claiming to have created something perfect in crypto should be met with scrutiny, as blockchains themselves are inherently limited to a core trade-off between speed, scale, and security.This section discusses the trust assumptions, or security considerations, that a developer may encounter when building on top of LayerZero. Not all of these are protocol risks — many are practical risks that address social or application-level security. That being said, in good faith, we will address all types of trust assumptions here.(Editor’s note: No pictures from here on out. Only niche interop analysis.)Smart Contract Risk: Endpoints and MessageLibs are the basis for cross-chain communication for LayerZero. If these contracts contain a bug, then the core protocol is at risk.Malicious Developers: Developers are responsible for setting their own Security Stacks. This allows them to point to malicious DVNs and/or change a configuration at a whim if a governance or internal security process is not set up to prevent them from doing so.Diversity of DVNs: While the protocol is unopinionated, the DVNs verifying messages are not. Therefore, if there is a limited set of DVNs and applications choose to not run their own DVNs, then messages sent across the network might be censored in some way, similar to how some Ethereum validators do not include OFAC-sanctioned transactions.DVNs and Good Faith Attestation: Similar to the above bullet, it must be noted that there is a trust assumption that DVNs will not collude.Executor x Liveness: In theory, anybody may execute transactions in V2. Liveness should never be an issue, as an end-user or application can manually execute transactions on LayerZero Scan if the configured Executor goes offline. However, if, in practice, configured Executors go down frequently, there are short-term liveness concerns for applications building on LayerZero.Defaults: When developers begin experimenting with LayerZero, they can opt into LayerZero Labs’ default Security Stack or set their own Security Stack. The default Security Stack is set by and can be changed by LayerZero Labs at any time. Any application that abdicates its security choice to LayerZero Labs’ defaults, therefore, abdicates its security to a centralized third party. The current default setting is Google Cloud and LayerZero Labs.Endpoint Deployments: LayerZero Labs is the only entity that can deploy canonical, socially accepted endpoints. If LayerZero Labs were to shut down, that would stop the current iteration of LayerZero from extending to new chains.The cross-chain world is filled with bridges, liquidity networks, and token standards. Here’s a brief outline of where LayerZero fits.Much like Bitcoin is built on the idea of self-custody (ownership over the security of your commodity), LayerZero is built on the idea of Security Stacks (ownership over the security of your application).In V2, any entity that can verify a message — be it a native bridge, third-party bridge, validator set, oracle, multisig, light client, zk prover, etc. — may be used as a DVN by an application building on top of LayerZero.This section of the article will make the case that many of the most popular third-party bridges are actually just decentralized verifier networks (DVNs) that can be used as Adapter DVNs built by application owners to verify messages in V2.In other words, many existing bridges will likely end up as DVNs competing to verify messages inside LayerZero.For more context, third-party bridges are cross-chain protocols competing against each other to build the most robust, industry-trusted mechanism for verifying messages between certain subsets of chains. Examples of third-party bridges include CelerIM, Axelar, deBridge, CCIP, Synapse, Wormhole, Router, IBC, etc. The designs for third-party bridges often revolve around shared security and can be generally bucketed into three categories. Middlechains like Axelar and Synapse validate messages as a hub and emit messages to spokes. There are guardian third-party bridges that attest to the validity of messages through reputational multi-sigs — like Wormhole and Avalanche Bridge. You can think of them as oracles or attestation services that sign off on cross-chain messages for a fee. The last type of third-party bridge is of a somewhat more vague bucket, which we call trust-minimized systems. These involve either zk proofs, light clients, or optimistic proofs, which can be boiled down to only having to trust one thing: math, chain consensus, and a single honest watcher, respectively.No third-party bridge has quite cracked the code on the “best” form of security. Middlechains compete to build the most unhackable hubs. Guardians compete to bring in the most reputable players in crypto to attest to cross-chain transactions. Trust-minimized systems use the finest tools that math, blockchains, and game theory have to offer.While each of these entities can send/receive arbitrary data across chains, that is not what third-party bridges are exceptional at. These third-party bridges are actually excellent at verification — at proving that this message happened over here and can be sent over there.With the new V2 design, these third-party bridges, as DVNs, get to focus on what they do best — signing off on valid cross-chain transactions — and applications select the third-party bridges they want based on use-case preferences. This design should be a win-win, as third-party bridge designers no longer need to worry about execution and/or transmission of cross-chain messaging, and applications are no longer locked into a single verification method when building something that exists on multiple blockchains.By allowing third-party bridges to do what they do best (verify things), LayerZero can focus on the main idea: unified semantics — allowing developers to compose contracts in the same way, regardless of chain. Every data packet sent and every endpoint interacted with on the LayerZero protocol is identical. LayerZero is built to allow developers to pick and choose from every type of verification method available on the market. It is a permissionless, censorship-resistant, and immutable structure that can be filled with any type (or combination) of verification method. This is powerful, as it future-proofs LayerZero against advancements in verification techniques while allowing for universal blockchain composability through a standardized messaging design.Any type of liquidity network can be recreated on LayerZero.Another bucket of “bridges” are cross-chain protocols that allow for the transfer of tokens across chains. These are called liquidity networks. Examples include Across, Hop, Portal, Connext, Stargate, Allbridge, DLN, UniswapX, Hyphen, Catalyst, and cBridge, among others. Most liquidity networks are designed around a basic intent structure: a user has asset X on Chain A and wants asset X on Chain B. A liquidity network matches an intent with a solving mechanism that is either onchain (liquidity pools/wrapped assets), offchain (often dubbed relayers), or a mixture of both. These solving mechanisms essentially take the user’s token on Chain A and unlock/fill the same amount of tokens on Chain B. They charge a small fee for this service. The competition amongst liquidity networks can be found in bridge price execution, fees, number of tokens offered to users, and transfer time.Something interesting about liquidity networks is that the verification method used underneath the liquidity network is somewhat arbitrary. Like how multiple AMMs can be built on top of Ethereum, many liquidity networks can technically be built on the same verification network. UniswapX emphasizes this point — it spent an entire whitepaper only talking about the liquidity aspects of the protocol (fillers, dutch-auction, optimistic execution, etc.) while not naming the underlying verification network it might use! All the whitepaper says is that a “settlement oracle” is necessary, which could be “a canonical bridge… light client bridge, or a third party bridge.” Anything passing a message between chains can be the settlement oracle here! This character trait is not unique to UniswapX. Other liquidity network designs like DLN and cBridge and Wormhole’s Portal and Catalyst could likely use other third-party bridges (aka DVNs) for settlement.What these liquidity networks need is not necessarily a single third-party bridge — rather, they need a verification method they can trust depending on the chain pairing and use case. With V2, LayerZero could theoretically support each liquidity network for messaging (settlement) while allowing them to choose unique verification methods (Security Stacks).LayerZero V2 offers a single messaging framework for many different types of liquidity networks to be built using different Security Stack configurations. This broadens the scope of what can be made and should result in fun experimentation. For example, a cross-chain AMM might select a Security Stack based on trade size, with the idea that different trade volumes will be settled by different Security Stacks (essentially bridge aggregation through Security Stack optionality).The modular blockchain thesis, the L2 scaling thesis, the omnichain thesis — all of these ideas require universal token and contract standards so that the world of 1000s of chains can operate without fragmentation and context switching depending on each new chain/asset/VM pairing. Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs) and Omnichain Applications (OApps) aim to be those standards — extending developer capability without compromising security.With V2, LayerZero should have a good chance of becoming the single framework for cross-chain tokens and governance, as it offers a universal messaging solution with a modular verification layer.In other words, a token or governance setup can use ANY type of verification method — or combination of verification methods — to move data to a destination chain using V2, with the only trust assumption being the sanctity of LayerZero Endpoints (a trust assumption that cannot be escaped with any other solution, either).Overall, the case can — and maybe should — be made that OFTs and OApps become the de facto contract standards for all tokens and contracts moving forward for teams building on LayerZero-supported chains. Here are a few reasons why:LayerZero’s architecture — modular at the verification level while static at the transport layer — strikes a crucial balance of current performance and future-proofed design.The technology is here for us to build an open and just digital economy for all people, for all time. As an industry, crypto has to work together to bring that vision to fruition. By nature of that shared goal, our technologies must be permissionless.For that vision to succeed, this philosophy must be upheld at every level of the stack. LayerZero defends these values down to the packet level.When features are mutable, values can always be changed. Promises aren’t permanent. Decisions aren’t durable. Upgrades are risks. Eventually, systems are corrupted.Permanence and provability must be hard coded.That’s why LayerZero is here. That’s why LayerZero exists.LayerZero is built so you don’t have to trust others. It’s built so you can trust yourself.For more information on V2, check out this thread, read this article, or check out our docs.To learn more about LayerZero in general, check out the website.

Considering the perks and security features of adopting blockchain technology, many industries have started adopting it.But a fact here is, that the term blockchain is known only among the tech people that too only the name. The rest of the people are not even aware of blockchain. Probinar took it as a motto to share knowledge about this outstanding technology with people all over the globe. By learning this technology, many perks can be reaped in the future that can be discussed further.Now, let’s take off this article with…Blockchain is a digital ledger that is used to store and maintain data securely. It is a distributed ledger where multiple parties can access the blockchain at a time. The core benefit of blockchain is that it is very hard to change or alter the data stored within it. It needs full approval from all the participants of the blockchain to grab data. The term blockchain exactly describes the collection of data(blocks) joined together to frame a blockchain.Multiple blocks collected together form a hash and connecting hashes frame a block. Several transactions or data entering a blockchain will be converted into a digital code with encryption and decryption techniques, checked by the validators, and stored in a block. Several blocks connected frame a blockchain.The following are the major benefits that come along with leveraging blockchain technology for your business.Not only these, as per this article’s title, we shall discuss…Learning about blockchain is crucial for several reasons, from career advancement to fostering innovation. Here are some key points why should you consider gaining a solid understanding of blockchain technology.Blockchain is not just a buzzword; it’s a thriving industry with a growing demand for skilled professionals. Companies across sectors such as finance, healthcare, supply chain, and technology are actively seeking individuals with blockchain expertise. Job roles like blockchain developer, blockchain engineer, smart contract developer, and blockchain consultant are gaining prominence, offering lucrative salaries and career growth. By learning about blockchain, you position yourself to take advantage of these emerging opportunities and future-proof your career.Blockchain technology has the potential to transform traditional business models and create new ones. Entrepreneurs and innovators are leveraging blockchain to build decentralized applications (dApps), launch cryptocurrencies, and develop new financial products like decentralized finance (DeFi). Learning about blockchain allows you to tap into this spirit of innovation, enabling you to conceive and develop ideas that can disrupt existing industries or create entirely new markets.One of the core features of blockchain is its security. Transactions on a blockchain are recorded in a tamper-resistant and transparent manner, ensuring data integrity. This security aspect has applications across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and government. By understanding blockchain, you gain insights into how to create secure systems that protect sensitive information. This knowledge is invaluable in a world increasingly concerned with data breaches and cybersecurity threats.Blockchain introduces the concept of decentralization, reducing the need for intermediaries in various processes. This decentralized approach fosters trust among participants, as transactions and data are verified by a distributed network rather than a central authority. Learning about blockchain can help you understand how to build trust in systems, which has applications in areas like voting systems, supply chain management, and peer-to-peer transactions.Blockchain has fundamentally transformed the financial industry with the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding blockchain allows you to navigate this new financial landscape, including concepts like digital wallets, smart contracts, and decentralized exchanges. This knowledge is not only useful for personal investment but also for developing financial products that cater to the growing demand for decentralized finance (DeFi).As blockchain technology continues to evolve, its influence will extend to more aspects of our digital lives. From digital identity to decentralized cloud storage, blockchain applications are expanding rapidly. By learning about blockchain, you stay relevant in this digital era, ensuring that you are equipped with the skills and knowledge to adapt to new trends and technologies.As we discussed earlier, blockchain education is beneficial, whereas learning blockchain with Probinar is highly beneficial.

The paper provides a potential way of powering web3 by virtual of tokens that are attached and used to establish unique identities on the web. That sort of thing is critically important for web3 as I discussed here. But read the paper carefully and there is worrying element with regard how it might use those identities in practice.It starts with the common issue that many who push for blockchain solutions to things worry about … decentralisation.The reason this is a concern is that the whole point of establishing unique identities is so that governance is not subject to coordination. In blockchain circles one such concern is the 51% attack where a single entity controls the majority of the ‘votes.’ But there is more than that:To do this the authors propose “a protocol [that] could examine the correlations between SBTs held by different Souls and discount votes by Souls (pooling them as only partially separate) if they share a large number of SBTs.” What do they mean by this? There isn’t much discussion but what they mean is plain for all to see in the mathematics left in an appendix to the paper.Suppose you have three people who are part of a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). They are deciding on something and they could vote on what to do based on quadratic voting that has some nice properties (but that isn’t critical to the story). They show that three voters — Abdu, Shou and Belle — can vote for good outcomes if they do so independently.But what if some of the voters have something in common, such as where they work?They don’t take the extreme approach. Instead, the authors argue that a “simple approach, which we call “clustering,” would put two co-workers “under the same square root” in the quadratic formula to offset their tendency to already coordinate.”There is a lot going on there. Basically, the move is away from one person, one vote to taking the votes of people who are presumed to have some common interest — in this case, where they work — and then putting them together to weaken their force. In other words, their votes count for less!And it is not just one dimension but potentially a whole lot of dimensions that could determine your power in voting before getting a chance to vote.Now I’m not going to necessarily equate the authors’ motives with voter suppression tactics that are used except that they really seem to be that. I mean what else do we call limiting the voting power of people with certain affiliations and characteristics?Why are the authors led down this dark path? The reason is that something like quadratic voting can really be exploited when people coordinate their actions. In that way, they can get together pre-vote, work out a plan that is good for them as a group and obtain that outcome via coordination which is better for them than what is likely to arise if they all vote independently. One way to deal with that is not to use quadratic voting. The other way is to adjust this. It is that path that the authors lean into.But there is a reason that we don’t like fiddling with characteristics and affiliations this way — it makes some people more equal than others. And who is to say how this should occur? The whole point of voting on stuff is to surface what we don’t know and that is more valuable precisely when we can’t have the knowledge to presume that we will know what an outcome will be. This is a slippery slope towards exclusion which would surely be anathema to the whole exercise.The authors seem enamoured by the autonomous part of DAOs rather than the need to engage in policing explicit collusion or coordination — i.e., vote selling. Indeed, almost as an afterthought in the appendix, the authors discuss “pairwise matching” which is based on the idea of one of them that monitors the network for specific attacks. They realise its advantage in that “it has the important advantage that it does not require an extrinsic source to specify who is coordinating and who is not; instead, this information is extracted from the contribution values themselves.” There are dangers here but it is akin to policing voter fraud rather than pre-emptively discounting the votes of some people.","tags":[],"author":"Joshua Gans","creation_date":"2022-06-13"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/yield-guild-games/yield-guild-games-treasury-update-april-1-2024-3b3d6c017f77","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The following is a summary of the Yield Guild Games (YGG) Treasury Update, which follows up on the February 2024 Community Update and…","title":"Yield Guild Games: Treasury Update — April 1, 2024","detailed_content":"The following is a summary of the Yield Guild Games (YGG) Treasury Update, which follows up on the February 2024 Community Update and outlines the status of Yield Guild’s treasury of assets as of April 1, 2024.Yield Guild Games (YGG) has undergone an evolution from being the first and largest web3 gaming guild to the first web3 protocol enabling the formation and growth of onchain guilds. Through its partnerships across games, web3 infrastructure projects, and guilds, YGG addresses a primary challenge of the gaming industry — targeting high-value players and driving community engagement.With over 100 web3 partners, eight regional guild partners, and two user acquisition products, YGG continues to build an ecosystem where great games and communities intersect. Supported by the Yield Guild Games Association (Yield Guild), which has maintained a carefully managed treasury, YGG has created a sustainable environment where players can have access to premium assets enabling them to build their onchain reputation and earn rewards.As of April 1, 2024, Yield Guild’s treasury holds US$67 million worth of assets, divided into three categories: Token Positions, NFT Gaming Assets, and Network Validators.Token PositionsToken positions make up US$62.6 million, or 93.5% of the treasury. Vested tokens make up US$43.2 million, further broken down to US$17.1 million in stablecoins and large-cap tokens, and US$26.1 million from tokens of games and partners. The remaining US$19.4 million is in unvested tokens, SAFTs and SAFEs.NFT Gaming AssetsYGG holds US$4.0 million in vested assets and US$405,000 in unvested NFTs.Network ValidatorsYield Guild has 56.1 million OAS tokens, valued at US$5.3 million, staked on the Oasys Network. The Association also has 1.0 million RON tokens, valued at US$4.1 million, staked on Ronin. Lastly, Yield Guild staked 548,000 XPLA tokens valued at US$157,000.“On the back of a long bear market, we are very happy with our strong position in terms of both vested tokens as well as our position with gaming tokens and NFT gaming assets,” said YGG co-founder Beryl Li. “Our position has benefited greatly from our proactive role as a validator for three important networks in the web3 gaming space. In total, we have earned in excess of US$3.0 million in validator rewards. We are really looking forward to strong growth in the year ahead as more of our partner games come online and the YGG community drives gaming adoption forward.”With a strong treasury, YGG has over 20 months of runway for business operations, extending into 2026. In the next 12–18 months, projects will launch with Yield Guild holding assets in these games and services.Yield Guild has been able to defend, maintain, and grow its position even during the bear market, with the treasury reflecting this success. The Association is poised to leverage its position as new games launch in 2024 and 2025. The Yield Guild treasury will continue to be used to make strategic partnerships, build an onchain guild network, and further improve questing products.View the full Yield Guild Games Treasury Update here.","tags":["Cryptocurrency","Blockchain","Gaming","Games","Web3"],"author":"Yield Guild Games","creation_date":"2024-05-02"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@goranetwork/understanding-verifiable-credentials-on-algorand-with-goplausible-and-gora-cd9b460d8f12","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) sets standards for the web, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials…","title":"Understanding Verifiable Credentials on Algorand with Gora and GoPlausible","detailed_content":"The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) sets standards for the web, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). These act as verifiable information packages about a subject (holder) with identifiers, attributes, properties, and credentials. Those follow an Issuer-Holder-Verifier model, which may differentiate a little in blockchain deployments since verification in the decentralized world makes use of features like cryptography suites and delegated logic (Smart Contracts).\nVCs are increasingly used in education, E-Governments, healthcare (EHRs), and many more.Why are VCs Important? Because of its broader acceptance; W3C VCs are acceptable by a wide variety of digital services and systems (banking, health, governments, tourism, transportation, etc). The future of identity and credentials is 100% digital and eventually decentralized since blockchains are the most fit-for-purpose solutions addressing identity and credential-specific requirements like provenance, tamperproof-ness, trust establishment, verifiable timestamping, privacy, and more.Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are essentially digital versions of real-world credentials like diplomas, certificates, permits, or licenses. They offer a secure and verifiable way to manage these credentials mostly in an inclusive and decentralized way. Here are some of the key features of Verifiable Credentials:How are VCs Stored?VCs storage is defined by two major factors:Given these two decisive factors, VC storage may be implemented by one of these approaches:Verifiable Credentials provide a secure and private way to manage digital credentials. While the core information is stored securely in your digital wallet, the blockchain serves as a trusted record-keeping system for verifying their authenticity.Verifiable Credentials and NFTs:It’s important to understand the distinction between VCs and NFTs. VCs are not NFTs themselves, the NFTs here are a tool that can be used to represent or link to VCs. This misconception is quite common. NFTs can be part of the VC system but are not mandatory. In the case of GoPlausible VC system distribution and Gora verifiers, NFTs are part of the Verifiable Credentials microsystem which is called #PLAUS within the PLAUSIBLE protocol context. Verifiable Presentations (VP) as well can also be used with NFTs.NFTs are linked to Verifiable Credentials in a well-known structure named Linked Data and are not mandatory in Verifiable Credential scenarios, but since the Web 3.0 community leans toward NFTs as means of non-fungible data blocks and also because NFTs are cool and fun, those are used within the PLAUSIBLE protocol to present Verifiable Credentials. Gora verifiers, although supporting the NFTs for DIDs and VCs, do not necessarily require them to operate (e.g contract based NFTs or even non-NFT VC implementations are as well supported by Gora thanks to cutting-edge multi-chain data layer I/O Gora has created.Verifiable Credentials are not “minted” or “mintable” because those are not tokens. However, it is NFTs within Verifiable Credential systems that are minted and mintable during the VC operations. In many VC operational scenarios without NFTs, no minting occurs at all (smart contract-only micro-credentials for example).Gora’s Role in Verifying VCs and the Partnership with GoPlausible:Gora, in collaboration with GoPlausible, has implemented the tech stack to verify issued VCs in the Algorand blockchain. This verification occurs by checking the validity, authenticity, and assertions of the DIDs, VCs, or VPs separately from the GoPlausible and PLAUSIBLE protocol, using one of these two types of verification approaches:GoPlausible has been collaborating with Gora on several fronts for quite some time now and one of those is the implementation of DID and VC verification by Gora (as of separation of concerns required in ID and Credentials ecosystems) to achieve a 100% separated yet integrated and interoperable service under Gora to verify DIDs and VCs independently.\nThe air-gapped registration, distribution (happens on the GoPlausible side), and verification (happens on the Gora side) guarantee the security, integrity, and authenticity of W3C identifiers and credentials ecosystem on the Algorand blockchain as well as advocating the spirit of collaboration and #togetherness in the Web 3.0 ecosystem.According to Gora’s innovative multi-chain efforts, GoPlausible is confidently planning on harnessing Gora nodes for future expansions to Multi-chain and other Web 3.0 ecosystems because of the proven and reliable technology delivered by Gora.Verifiable Credentials costs:Ownership security and anonymity:While Verifiable Credentials are hard linked to a recipient’s Algorand account, losing control or access to the wallet containing that account (through hacking or other means) doesn’t necessarily mean losing the VC itself.Here’s why:However, losing access to the account does create some problems:In summary, while losing a wallet or account access doesn’t directly erase or change the VC, it limits your ability to demonstrate its ownership (till you regain control using one of the remediation methods mentioned earlier).None of the PLAUSIBLE and Gora protocols are concerned with the security of Algorand accounts as they both just work with Algorand wallets for accounts and signatures and rely on their account security as both are interop protocols only. So in terms of security, seed phrase, account recovery, and other account and private key-related concerns, wallet providers are the sole resource and source of action.These being clearly stated and regarding Verifiable Credentials, the good news is that soon and by the emergence of SSI (self-sovereign Identity) service by GoPlausible and Gora, if the private key (or its seed phrase) gets compromised in any way, then by acknowledging GoPlausible there are ways (using real identity verification through KYC, KYB,…) that will lead to revocation and re-issuance of all credentials to new accounts but the process include fees and presentation of at least one of verified ID documents included under SSI (e.g. there may be an ID card, Driving license, passports,…) with user’s picture and the actual user being in possession of the device requesting this (Camera for face verification will be activated).Blockchains are not just about anonymity and crypto trading in the shadows! One of the main advantages of blockchains is real-world usage scenarios and utilities for which users need to present real identity and credentials (for example, you will not be able to obtain a driver’s license, a diploma, or a passport anonymously). That being said, Verifiable Credentials are designed to preserve privacy to the most possible extent through features like ZK proofs, selective encryption, and selective disclosure, all coming soon to the Algorand DID and VC ecosystem very soon by GoPlausible and Gora collaborations.About GoPlausibleGoPlausible is a decentralized protocol on the Algorand blockchain that provides tools for the issuance, registration, and distribution of W3C-compliant DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and smart utility NFTs in a permissionless and user-friendly manner. GoPlausible aims to expand transparent Web 3.0 services to Web 2.0 through the innovative development of new features in Identity, Credentials, Authentication, Authorization, and Smart utility NFT domains in accordance and compliance with living web standards.\nFor more info visit: https://goplausible.com/About Gora NetworkGora Network is a next-gen decentralized Oracle platform that provides secure and reliable access to real-world data for blockchain-based applications.

The record of which wallets have which tokens is available for all to see on Bitcoin, Ethereum and anywhere else. You may not know who actually owns the wallets but there is a record there.Which brings me to Twitter. Twitter is a public record of messages associated with an account. You don’t know for sure who owns an account (unless they are verified) but you know that the account has given permission for certain messages to be listed in the ledger. Unlike blockchains, those messages are revocable from the ledger itself. But like blockchains, any message that was once part of the ledger can usually be recovered and so it is hard to remove messages completely once they have been public.Which brings me to Elon Musk. In one of the many statements he made upon agreeing to buy Twitter, Musk wrote:The key phrase is “authenticating all humans.” That could actually mean pretty much anything so I am going to do what any sensible commentator would do in this situation which is to write what I think that means, why it is valuable and, therefore, assert that this is what Musk has in his mind all along.Which brings me to Paul Graham. Graham was the founder of Y-combinator and wrote a very short essay in 2009 on “why Twitter is a big deal.” Here is most of it:You can see the relationship to my previous statement that Twitter is a public record with messages associated with accounts. The messages themselves have records and so are easy to point to by others. That is the heart of communications protocol.Communication protocols work best when you can authenticate when a message comes from a specific person. This is why email and phone spam have threatened previous protocols; phones are pretty much useless but email was recovered. They are the bots taken over which is something Elon Musk, at least, is worried about on Twitter (although one wonders whether that is really a ‘famous’ rather than ordinary people problem there). At times, the same issues have been obvious to Apple (hence, iMessage’s success) and Facebook which at an earlier time wanted to use its own email service to solve that problem.Twitter, being a public record, offers a potentially easy way of authenticating people. You often see people use it with messages like this:This was a service called Mirror that I set up an account on. I was then able to associate that account with my Twitter identity. That still doesn’t verify if either of them is associated with me in the real world but it starts to get at something. It is one of the methods proposed in the soulbound token paper I discussed last week.Herein lies the authentication that Musk might be talking about. If people could have their Twitter accounts verified to be associated with a real human, then by virtue of the Twitter public ledger, that could be used to associate that Twitter account and, by consequence, the human behind it with all manner of other accounts. If you can do that, you can get all of the web3 benefits from identification that have been outlined as well as providing a layer for all manner of identification.Of course, there are many who might not want that. I am not going to argue the pros and cons here. My goal was just to point out the possibility inherent in what Twitter is. It has already started to be used in that way but one can imagine that paired with other blockchain-like technologies it could go further. Is Twitter the best way to achieve all of this? I don’t know. What I do know is that it is there are a few hundred million people who are happy to use it which gives it a considerable headstart.","tags":[],"author":"Joshua Gans","creation_date":"2022-06-06"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@chaincom/a-beginners-guide-to-web3-865efb957354","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Tweet","summary":"Web3, simply put, is the next generation of the internet.

It’s a departure from the way we’re used to experiencing the online world. Unlike the traditional model, where central authorities like tech giants or governments have a strong grip on how things work, Web3 is all about decentralization. This means power is spread out across a network of users, making decisions more transparent and resistant to control.Think of it as a shift from a top-down structure to a community-driven one. In the world of Web3, users have more say, ownership, and control over their online interactions. It’s like a digital democracy where everyone has a voice.This guide is your gateway to understanding this exciting new digital landscape. We’ll break down the core principles of Web3, demystify complex terms like blockchain and dApps, and show you how these concepts are being used in real-world applications. By the time you’re done, you’ll have a solid grasp of what Web3 is all about and (hopefully) get you acclimated to the new era of the internet.Demystifying Web3Web3 Defined: Often categorized as the decentralized internet, Web3 represents a departure from the centralized platforms (Web2) that currently dominate the digital space. Centralized entities like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have significant control over your data and autonomy in Web2. In contrast, Web3 seeks to decentralize and democratize that control, empowering individual users.Blockchain \u0026 Its Significance: The blockchain is the backbone of Web3. It’s essentially a digital ledger where data is stored in ‘blocks’ and is chronologically ‘chained’ together. Every entry is transparent and immutable, which means it’s tamper-proof. The decentralized nature ensures data integrity without relying on a central authority.Tips: As you embark on your Web3 exploration, focus on mastering the foundational concepts. Familiarize yourself with the history of Bitcoin and blockchain, its different types (e.g., public, private, consortium), and its real-world applications.Setting Up Your Digital WalletThe Role of Digital Wallets: Consider your digital wallet as your Web3 passport. It’s where you store digital assets like cryptocurrency, interact with dApps (decentralized applications), and authenticate transactions. Unlike traditional bank accounts, you have full custody of your funds, signifying both power and responsibility.Wallet Varieties: From browser extensions and mobile apps to physical hardware devices, wallets come in various formats. Each has its advantages and is tailored for specific use cases.Tips: Your wallet’s security is paramount. Whether you’re opting for MetaMask (a popular browser extension) or a hardware wallet like Ledger, always ensure you’re obtaining it from a legitimate source. Store your seed phrase (a recovery tool) securely, preferably offline, and guard it as you would your most prized possession.Interacting with dApps, Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges, and Web3 Gaming PlatformsWhat is a dApp?A dApp, or decentralized application, is a software application that runs on a blockchain network. This means that dApps are not controlled by any single entity, but rather by the network of users who participate in it. This makes dApps more transparent and resistant to censorship than traditional applications, which are typically hosted on centralized servers.How do dApps work?DApps are built on top of blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. When a user interacts with a dApp, their actions are recorded on the blockchain. This means that all transactions are visible to everyone on the network, which makes it difficult to fraud or censorship.What are some popular types of dApps?There are many different types of dApps, but some of the most popular ones include:Why are dApps important?DApps have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet. By removing the need for centralized control, dApps can make the internet more transparent, secure, and accessible to everyone.Like any new technology, there are some risks associated with dApps. For example, dApps are still in their early stages of development, so there is a risk of bugs and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, dApps can be complex and difficult to use, which can make them inaccessible to some users.Despite these risks, dApps have the potential to be a major force in the future of the internet. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see more and more dApps being created and used.Exchanges and Token Trading in the Web3 EcosystemDigital asset exchanges play a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency and Web3 landscape. These platforms enable users to trade or “swap” their digital assets, either for other tokens or fiat currency. Broadly speaking, exchanges fall under two categories: centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX). Each has its unique set of advantages and disadvantages, primarily revolving around custody, user interface, and functionality.Centralized Exchanges (CEX):Examples: Binance, Coinbase, KrakenDecentralized Exchanges (DEX):Examples: Uniswap, Sushiswap, PancakeSwapGaming in Web3:Platforms like Decentraland and Axie Infinity have burst onto the scene, transforming traditional gaming paradigms. Not only do they offer a virtual playground, but they also provide an economic incentive for players. This shift is evident in the different models these platforms embrace:Tips: Always conduct thorough research before interacting with a new dApp, exchange, or gaming platform. Be wary of platforms promising unrealistic returns or those lacking a transparent development team and community feedback.Additional Tips and InsightsSecurity: Web3’s freedom comes with increased responsibility. Phishing attempts are rife. Always double-check website URLs, never share your private key or seed phrase, and utilize two-factor authentication when available.Gas and Transaction Fees: Primarily on the Ethereum network, transactions require a fee called “gas.” This fee can fluctuate based on how busy the network is. Having a grasp of gas fees is essential to avoid excessive payments or insufficient payments, both of which might result in transaction delays.Understanding Networks: Different blockchain platforms (like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana) have multiple networks. Ensure you’re on the correct network when executing transactions.Community Engagement: Tapping into Web3 communities can be invaluable. Platforms like Reddit, Discord, or even ‘Crypto’ Twitter have myriad channels dedicated to specific dApps, games, or general Web3 discussions.Closing ThoughtsWeb3 is not merely a technological evolution; it’s a societal and philosophical shift. It promises a more inclusive, transparent, and decentralized digital future. As with any transformative journey, it requires vigilance, continuous learning, and an open yet discerning mind.As you navigate Web3, prioritize understanding over investment.

Mostly this is, as I argued previously, because (a) it uses lots of electricity and (b) that people don’t think this is a good use for that electricity. But, recently, the focus has been on the type of electricity. For instance, Elon Musk, who previously embraced Bitcoin as a payment option for Tesla, backed away given the ‘brand confusion’ associated with promoting environmental friendliness when Bitcoin was not.Musk’s view is that it is not the electricity per se but the type of electricity that is at issue. At a conference in 2021, he remarked:In other words, if Bitcoin runs on renewables (solar, wind, geothermal) it will be back in Tesla’s good books. The intention is to make Bitcoin non-carbon polluting. But will such a shift actually do that? Or will it just look like it is doing that? There’s a difference.Let’s begin by looking at some Bitcoin electricity facts. This week Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok released the new chapter of their economics textbook on Cryptoeconomics (it is a great introduction to the whole sector by the way). They provide a brief overview of the “energy problem.”Bitcoin is costly as a payment system. But Bitcoin actually isn’t used that much so the total cost is surprisingly small by comparison to other things. That’s all very well, but if Bitcoin reaches the heights its advocates are hoping for, those costs will rise so this isn’t something to be complacent about.There are, however, two important aspects to Bitcoin’s energy usage that are worth noting. First, it is highly space agnostic. What I mean by that is that the Bitcoin network is global but it does not matter where Bitcoin mining and hence, electricity usage takes place. You only need a half-decent connection to the Internet to run such an operation. Other than that, you can do it anywhere. That means that Bitcoin mining will move and concentrate where on the planet energy costs are cheapest. If Bitcoin was actually a bigger thing, this could have the effect of causing electricity prices around the world to equalise. In terms of its use of renewables, the good news is that the opportunities are worldwide. The bad news is that this will be driven purely by cost considerations.Second, medium and long-term Bitcoin energy usage is highly unpredictable. If you look over the past year, the hash rate (that is, the amount of computational effort devoted to mining bitcoins) has been highly variable but it was distorted when mining facilities in China were shut down.A better view is over the life of bitcoin. Note that the hash rate rises and falls with Bitcoin’s price. The correlation is far from perfect but makes intuitive sense. The reward to mining are bitcoins you might earn so it makes sense that if the value of the prize gets higher, it will pay to devote more assets (computing capacity) to Bitcoin and to run those assets more intensively.The relationship isn’t perfect because (a) the number of bitcoins earned through mining has been ratcheting down over time and (b) the difficulty of the computational contest is ratcheting up over time. Both of these make mining less attractive. In other words, the “work” in proof of work is designed to become harder both over time (naturally) and also the more lucrative to contest seems to be. (For a mathematical treatment, see this paper of mine with June Ma and Rabee Tourky).What this means is that Bitcoin energy usage is as predictable as the bitcoin price (i.e., not very predictable) although the automatic stabilisers built into the computational difficulty adjustment do play a role in smoothing this out.With this background, let’s evaluate the substance of Musk’s proposal — that the use of Bitcoin is tied to the share of renewables going into its production. Will this do anything to promote cleaner Bitcoin?It is hard to imagine how. Bitcoin mining can be conducted by anyone which makes it difficult to coordinate how energy is used and what energy is used. But suppose, contrary to facts, that Bitcoin mining was conducted by a single entity. Then they would have an interest in boosting the price of Bitcoin. Thus, if they thought that Musk and others were likely to adopt it at a sufficiently high rate, they would allocate mining resources to be powered by renewables. So far so good.But this is 1-level thinking. The real issue is what this does for global pollution. If Bitcoin were to dramatically increase its use of renewables — maybe to be totally renewable, this will change electricity usage across all of the uses of electricity. Make sure Bitcoin is solar-powered in, say, Australia, and the price of solar-generated electricity will go up while coal-generated electricity will go down. As demand has merely shifted around, so long as electricity users other than those for Bitcoin do not care about where their electricity comes from, then nothing really will change. The total volume of electricity pollution will be the same. All that will change is that Bitcoin miners can feel better about what they are using. That said, in the long-run, investment will be encouraged for renewables and discouraged for polluting electricity. But those effects take time to happen and Bitcoin itself is still a drop in the bucket there.In order to really work what you would have to do is build a solar facility dedicated to Bitcoin somewhere (adding to total electricity capacity) and use that. But that would only be the first step. After all, if you leave it cut off from other uses, you are actually making pollution worse because you are producing renewable electricity but not using it to compete with polluting electricity which is something we want to happen. If you built it on some remote location — say, out to sea, where the only other thing that can be built is a massive Bitcoin mining rig, then maybe you aren’t creating capacity that can be used for other purposes and that will be something pure. But this is an awful lot of work to get clean proof of work. Moreover, under current Bitcoin rules, this isn’t going to really work unless that whole endeavour is cheaper at the margin than other sources.And why won’t it be cheaper? Because Bitcoin computational demand, over the medium to long run, is highly unpredictable. That means you have to build capacity to handle the peaks and you don’t know what those will be and when. That means a ton of capital tied up in the independent but clean Bitcoin mining enterprise. That makes it very costly to achieve.The “let’s make Bitcoin cleaner” movement does not address any real problem with Bitcoin and does not address in an impactful way the broader issue which is that of polluting electricity generation. We know that what we need there is a proper climate policy and a carbon price and then we can worry less about electricity usage and let the market sort out the cleaner sourcing options.The only other way to address this is to move to something like proof-of-stake. That’s what Ethereum is doing but it doesn\u0027t seem like Bitcoin will ever be able to follow suit. The point is that there are more energy-efficient ways of running cryptocurrency networks but Bitcoin is not structured to take advantage of them.The point here is that holding up Bitcoin as something uniquely polluting and worthy of significant policy attention for this reason, is a big, fat distraction from real issues. It is a game unworthy of the so-called rationalists that make up much of the crypto community.","tags":[],"author":"Joshua Gans","creation_date":"2022-05-23"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@scottdebevic/why-you-dont-want-to-miss-this-memecoin-2e07a20f93a3","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Memecoins will be a big part of this crypto cycle.

Lottoday’s usage of smart contracts enhances this by providing a transparent and auditable framework for gaming operations. This means that individuals have access to every piece of code executed, and every transaction made, building trust among players and giving them more confidence to engage with the platform.While big projects in the industry benefit from collecting as much information about you as possible, either for advertising or other more profitable purposes, Lottoday prides itself on going against the grain and prioritizing players’ anonymity. This allows players to participate in games without revealing their identities, only identifying them by their cryptographic addresses, while minimizing the risk of personal data exposure or leaks.Fair play is the cornerstone of an enjoyable gaming experience, however, traditional platforms, and in recent times, even some more decentralized counterparts, have a well-documented history of altering rules or operations, dating all the way back to the birth of the first casinos in the 17th century, which inevitably hurts the players and overall experience.By using Smart Contracts, and implementing algorithms \u0026 rules that are transparently enforced and executed, and cannot be manipulated by any party, internal or external, Lottoday is able to provide completely fair results, no matter what game you’re playing.But as with any new technology, with all of the benefits that blockchain has to offer, there is also growing competition, along with nearly as many challenges that, when put together, end up determining who gets the biggest market share, and how fast mainstream adoption can be achieved.However, this is where strategic partnerships come into play, so let’s discover how Lottoday is navigating uncharted waters with the help of our partners!Every time a new block of data is added to the blockchain, some energy is used, usually referred to as a transaction cost or gas fee. This means that every time a player is participating in a game, buying a Lottery ticket, or even just making a prediction in a game, they pay a small amount as a fee. This cost can vary depending on the blockchain used, the amount of network traffic, the supply of validators, and the demand for transaction verification. If the platform uses a blockchain that is energy inefficient or has bad scalability, those costs can quickly add up, cutting into the users’ potential winnings.By partnering with ULTRON FOUNDATION, a TOP Layer-1 blockchain that supplies Lottoday with an energy-efficient, fast, and scalable solution as the backbone, we can provide players with some of the lowest transaction fees on the market, usually costing less than $0.0001per transaction, while still making games available on other major blockchains to increase accessibility.Attracting users to Web3 platforms also comes with its own unique set of technological challenges, especially when players have no prior experience with blockchain or crypto.This means navigating the complicated processes of setting up wallets, bridging, or swapping your assets.That’s why it’s not only important to have partners with strong technology, but also to build partners with large ecosystems. Ultron Foundation is well aware of this which is why it recently teamed up with Transak, launching a new feature on UltronSwap, that benefits Lottoday users as well. It simplifies the process of topping up your wallet by allowing you to purchase tokens directly with your existing traditional payment methods, eliminating the need for bridging assets across blockchain networks.With a big selection of benefits and a strategic approach to overcoming challenges, Lottoday is on its way to becoming the biggest Web3 gaming platform. Don’t wait any longer, experience the advantages of blockchain, and jump into Lottoday yourself.","tags":["Web3 Game","Predictions","Lottery","Blockchain","Web3"],"author":"Lottoday","creation_date":"2024-05-03"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@shantanugupta12/3-altcoins-to-watch-closely-this-bull-cycle-ec13790ac293","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"1.

After this week, it is safe to say that more and more people are with them. That said, as I argued, the reasons economists give for not liking Bitcoin don’t really stack up with their own usual ways of looking at things. Namely, it is not clear that it is driving illegal payments, its missing foundation makes it more like money, and in terms of wasting resources, economists usually look for market failures to evaluate that and, in the case of Bitcoin, it is unclear the market failures are there.Nonetheless, I left that discussion hanging in that I actually think there are some legitimate economic concerns about Bitcoin. But this requires us to look beyond the usual competitive markets framework and, instead, focus on one thing economists usually don’t focus on (irrational behaviour) and another thing they definitely do worry about (market power).In doing this, I am going to divide my analysis into two in order to answer the question of what economic service Bitcoin is providing. On the one hand, I will consider it as a store of value — digital gold if you will. On the other hand, I am going to characterise it as purely a game — a gambling game. Crypto enthusiasts aren’t going to like that. The reality is a mix of the two. It just serves my purpose to separate them out analytically as you will see. With that warning, let’s go to it and start by offending people as much as possible.Noah Smith wrote about the potential uses of Bitcoin. He considered four theories but, for some reason, however, he did not consider Bitcoin to be purely a gambling game. But to an economist, that is pretty much what it looks like. And games fall into the category of being potentially legitimate economic activity so it is an odd omission.To see Bitcoin has a game you have to strip away the surrounding language that it may be a payment instrument or a normal financial asset. (By the way, much of what we consider ‘normal’ financial assets trade in markets in ways that are very game-like too so this characterisation is not unique to cryptocurrency it is just that so many people want to view it as something more that they shy away from the obvious).The game is pretty simple and was first identified by John Maynard Keynes in the General Theory. You’ll have to excuse the 1936 sensibilities here but here is how Keynes described a common newspaper game:He found that this pretty much described the stock market. You put money in the market and you get more if you can correctly anticipate stocks that other investors will find attractive. Now part of that calculation may be best on what we often call ‘the fundamentals’ but that may just be a narrative. There is little reason why any old stock couldn’t be suddenly found and then become attractive — I’m looking at you GameStop.The fewer fundamentals there are to point to, the more likely it is going to be a pure gambling game. You aren’t guessing from a static set, however, but you are playing a game of timing — or more critically, a game of chicken.In the game frame, you put money into Bitcoin because you anticipate that others are going to do so and keep doing so. That causes the price to go up which is what players in the game expect. But the players also know that this process can’t go on forever. To ‘win’ at this game, you want to sell right as there are more people about to become sellers than buyers. There are plenty of people selling early — after all, without that the price can’t continue to go up. And there will be plenty of people who sell late. But you want to get to the peak. So each day, you make a calculation — “is today the day?” You read the tea leaves or more properly look at the mood of other players on Discord or Reddit. You always want to egg people on. There’s no sense in convincing anyone that it is time to sell. Hence, there is plenty of enthusiasm and even if things get bumpy those incentives remain. After all, if you have potentially held on too long, you want to convince others that things will bounce back.The thing is, playing a game is a legitimate economic activity. For electronic games (sans cryptocurrency) spending is in excess of $50 billion per year and growing. In the US alone, casino gambling tops $40 billion per annum. Those sound like small change compared to Bitcoin but this isn’t about market value — it is about how many dollars (on net) have been exchanged for Bitcoin. So for all we know it could be quite comparable. So lamenting Bitcoin is a little like lamenting Second Life. It’s not for everyone but that isn’t our call to make.Interestingly, the Bitcoin and crypto games get their own add ons. DeFi allows more complex trading strategies and hedging of various risks. NFTs allow you to speculate on off-shoot assets — each their own separate game of chicken — and each with their own narratives making them literally a digital beauty contest. All of this broadens the strategies and so adds to the complexity and, one presumes, potential enjoyment of it all.One reaction to this is that this might just be a ‘bad’ game. Some might argue that people could play a similar game without, say, all the electricity consumption. That may be true but one of the things that make Bitcoin work is that it is a global game free of regulation. It may not be able to get to that point without proof of work. And if there were a better game, there is nothing stopping someone from making it. (Of course, that is easier said than done and, as I will argue below, things aren’t quite as simple as that).More critically, it is a gambling game. Gambling, from casinos to financial markets, is regulated. They are regulated precisely because many people can be convinced that it is not a game but it is instead ‘investing.’ Thus, they are not aware of the zero-sum nature of it all. If people are not the fully rational, calculating agents that economists often assume, we want to regulate these games to protect people from themselves. We don’t want people to lose their savings. We don’t want to facilitate addictive behaviours. And we don’t want people to be vulnerable to fraudulent claims — and as I pointed out, the Bitcoin game is primed for claims without basis. Indeed, that can be the whole game. Thus, it is very important that people know when they are playing and understand the rules.Therefore, one reason economists don’t like Bitcoin is that it can be problematic when people are not fully rational. What to do about it is another matter but that is, at the very least, a basis for legitimate concern.Let’s now move to the other extreme interpretation that Bitcoin is a financial asset that acts as a store of value — that is, it is a digital version of gold (or at least the common idea of gold).I don’t want to get into the debate about whether Bitcoin (or indeed gold) is a good store of value (like being an inflation hedge or something). Noah Smith has doubts, Vitalik Buterin thinks in a broad way it may achieve that aim. The perspective I want to take is to presume it is functioning as a store of value and then evaluate what economic problems might emerge from that.There are two ways of thinking about storing value. One way is in terms of use. If you hoard toilet paper (as if *that* could ever happen), you are doing so because you have calculated your expected lifetime use of toilet paper and decided it is worth getting all of that shopping out of the way now rather than overtime. The point is that the reason you are doing that, storing rather than buying, is because of potential value in use.The other way is in terms of exchange. This could apply to toilet paper too but let me use a less messy example: gold. Gold has uses but it is a store of value because it is anticipated that you can use it to buy stuff you need in the future. So it has value in exchange. Of course, while you might normally think that something has to be useful to someone else to have value in exchange (like toilet paper), gold has the property that if enough people think it can be valuable in exchange, then it can be valuable in exchange for anything. So it is fungible. The problem with this value is that it relies more heavily on expectations and a kind of beauty contest like effect than simply value in use.The nature of these expectations supported store of value is that the more people you anticipate agreeing that it is a store of value, the better and, indeed, more valuable it is as a store of value. This means that any given candidate for digital gold has built into it a network effect. One consequence of this is that there is an equilibrium where no one values it. But at the same time there is an equilibrium where people value it.The critical challenge is that if people do value it, it may be difficult to shift them out of that equilibrium. Now that isn’t a problem if you are choosing between two equivalent things as potential stores of value. The fact that one wins out is OK because one was always going to win out.But what we want is for that store of value to be productively efficient. We want people to be storing stuff at the least possible cost. After all, if we all agree on what value is being stored, isn’t it better that we store it in a cheap thing if possible.The problem is that new ways of storing value might arise over time. For instance, it may be that proof of stake is a lower-cost store of value than proof of work. (This isn’t a given by the way.) But Bitcoin was a ‘first mover’ and so potentially has become a store of value ahead of other cryptocurrency innovations. Given this, how can we be assured that Bitcoin is now the most efficient use? If something else came along, would people switch?In economics language, the concern is that Bitcoin has monopoly power in that we cannot rely on competition to efficiently generate alternative stores of value given that expectations are somewhat ‘locked in.’ Hence, when economists say they are worried about the waste they should be saying they are worried about market power. What’s worse here is that there is no obvious regulatory way of dealing with any potential market power on the part of Bitcoin because no one is in charge.I should add that even this argument is suggestive rather than proven. People’s expectations are clearly not quite ‘locked in’ to Bitcoin. But they could easily get that way in the future. Then in twenty years, we might be asking whether it is the best system we could have and be frustrated that there is no way to answer that question let alone change the system if there is something better. That sort of situation makes economists nervous.Economists have been glib in their assessments of Bitcoin. There are actually legitimate economic concerns but they rely on consumer irrationality or market power arguments rather than simple distaste or even market failure. If economists are going to engage properly on their concerns, they need to articulate those concerns within standard and well-developed frameworks. At present, they look more like children saying “they just don’t like it” or conservative people saying “it’s not the way we do things.” That isn’t helping.","tags":[],"author":"Joshua Gans","creation_date":"2022-05-16"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-king-of-rwa-to-integrate-blockchain-in-ufc-fighter-gloves-showcasing-real-world-asset-195943f4f84d","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"The tokenization of real world assets has become one of the hottest topics in the blockchain space following the entry of Blackrock, a…","title":"VeChain “King of RWA” To Integrate Blockchain In UFC Fighter Gloves, Showcasing Real World Asset…","detailed_content":"The tokenization of real world assets has become one of the hottest topics in the blockchain space following the entry of Blackrock, a leading asset manager, and their recent announcement of intent to launch an ‘RWA’ initiative. The notion of tokenizing everything, from stocks to skyscrapers, has single-handedly transformed the mass perception of blockchain technology as a viable tool for economic transformation.VeChainThor, our blockchain, has long been heralded as one of the few protocols to actually deliver in this area, working with influential companies from automotive and major IT companies, to Walmart, PwC, DNV, BMW and more. Most recently, we joined forces with Boston Consulting Group and launched a new global initiative, the VeBetterDAO ecosystem, to deliver an impactful dApp ecosystem for both consumers and enterprises to tokenize real world activity and derive new kinds of value from individual behaviours.The ability to imbue physical objects with immutable digital identities has a myriad of applications, from authentication to provenance, consumer engagement and marketing to sustainability, auditing and much, much more.Whether preserving the value of a luxury product in a secondary market or helping businesses collaborate in seamless data environments, the value add of blockchain is no longer in question, and the Web3 revolution has begun in earnest, with VeChain as its pioneer.The UFC is one of the fastest growing sporting brands in the world. Our global marketing partnership, announced in 2022, not only helped VeChain gain visibility in 900 million households globally, but vastly increased our digital footprint across media channels, offered new channels for community engagement and growth, and has helped boost the adoption of the VeChainThor protocol, highlighted by the sustained, rapid growth in new addresses seen recently on the network, adding 1.2 million new addresses over the past year.While our partnership began under the pretext of marketing, we are excited to share that the relationship has grown further, entering a new phase of technological integration. During UFC300, a new set of fighter gloves will be unveiled that not only improve the safety and wellbeing of UFC athletes, but contain VeChain-powered NFC blockchain technology.At a global press conference on Friday 12th 2024, Dana White will unveil a new development to a global audience — the integration of VeChain’s blockchain technology with sporting apparel that enhances both athlete performance, and improves the fan experience, offering a means of authentication and enhanced brand/athlete engagement post-event.This development will take place on a global stage and showcase a tangible use case of blockchain to a largely non crypto-native audience. To mark the occasion, Dana White has minted an initial set of 25 exclusive gloves for distributions to a prestigious list of A-list talent, including Joe Rogan and others, placing VeChain’s technology in the hands of some of the world’s most influential people.As a leader in the ‘RWA’ field, having been actively developing solutions since 2015, our experience, enterprise prestige, and technological prowess places the VeChainThor blockchain in the optimal position to lead a new phase in blockchain adoption. Working hand in hand with enterprise leaders and leveraging our proven proprietary technologies, we continue to remain incredibly confident of our role as the frontrunner and deliverant of this new era of tokenization and blockchain mass adoption.For our use case with the UFC and their fighter gloves, post-fights, athletes will donate and give away their apparel. By including VeChain’s NFC chips, our blockchain technology can provide an immutable record of the event itself, including the action between athletes, as well as serve as an authentication tool and introduce new ways to engage with fans of the sport. One example is through bespoke content, dedicated to a single individual, or for unique experiences, marketing opportunities or special offers, such as discounts. It also ensures the legitimacy of the item if sold or traded, eliminating fraud — a common problem for secondary markets.Today marks another step in our aspirations to drive real world adoption of blockchain. The journey is getting ready to get even faster, with regulations and institutions entering the space. We remain excited about our crucial role in building that future.VeChain, headquartered in San Marino, Europe, is the curator of VeChainThor, a world-leading smart contract platform spearheading the real-world adoption of blockchain technology, and a proud pioneer in the field of real world asset tokenization (RWA), having worked with companies in the area since 2015.By leveraging the capabilities of ‘trustless’ data (information without intermediaries), smart contracts, and IoT technologies, VeChainThor has enabled enterprise solutions across a wide array of fields.VeChain now turns its attention to the greatest challenge of all — building digital ecosystems to drive sustainability and digital transformation at global scale.Learn more about VeChain on vechain.org","tags":[],"author":"vechainofficial","creation_date":"2024-04-13"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/meld-gold/gp12-meld-gold-x-algorand-targeted-defi-rewards-tdr-distribution-plan-5fa14463b9d6","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Plan Summary What is the program goal? 1.

Until there’s a meeting of the minds, blockchain UX is going to suck. ( Jargon definitions: Web 2.0 is “the web” today. Web3 is what’s coming with the advent of blockchain technologies. Detailed definitions of Web 2.0 \u0026 Web3.)Over the past 4+ years, I’ve been dragged kicking and screaming into the actually-pretty-magical world of Web3. I’ve worked, or tried to work, with a bunch Web3 founders in two categories: the crypto-natives and the pre-disastered.Crypto-natives have been living and breathing Web3 for years. They populate an enormous echo chamber of people speaking a language that most tech people can’t even understand, to say nothing of the general public.I totally understand the sense of wonder and empowerment that comes from knowing you are building the future. That you know things that only your fellow travelers truly understand. And that some of these things will not only spell doom for what came before but are going to change the world. Early Web 2.0 inventors felt this same way and for the same reasons.The beginning of Web 2.0 was a time of “new paradigms” and “new economies” and new financial metrics and all the rest. What could we possibly learn from prior software projects? And how could old-school retail or catalog possibly have anything to teach us about building the web?From that perspective, it makes no sense for Web3 founders to look to Web 2.0 practices for…well…anything. Breaking from old standards and valuing creativity is core to Web3 DNA: everything is a candidate for revolutionary redesign. If you’re a crypto-native reinventing enormous stuff like trust, money and digital identity, why wouldn’t you reinvent ‘user experience’ and ‘how to develop software?’ Why use old practices to invent something new?Actually, even though the web was a very different beast from the software of the 90’s, it turns out we could have learned quite a bit. Creating a clear understanding of who your users are and figuring out what they want and need (not just what you want to give them) turned out to be a prerequisite of software success. The tedious process of having users interact with designs so you could iterate them before they were launched — actually, before they were coded — turned out to save time in the long run. And time-to-launch turned out to not matter nearly as much as ease of use (have you ever heard of Friendster or Orkut?). There are examples everywhere of companies losing big because of bad UX.Check out these stats:When I talk to the crypto-native founders about the value of basic user-centered design principles, the obvious risks of having engineers design user experiences, and the fact that user experience and product make or break projects almost every single time, they semi-patiently nod. Meanwhile, their brains are churning out great reasons why they don’t need any help, at least not right now.The follow-ups I get are predictable:I understand these responses. I’ve heard them before. Hell, years ago, I said them myself.Let’s get this out of the way: sure, there are lots of Web3 projects that have failed, but having a failed Web3 project does not mean that you have experienced product failure. If you are Web3-fluent, you can jump out of the window of the burning wreck of your failed Web3 experiment and have 14 offers of funding before you hit the ground. And if your Web3 experiment failed, it’s probably not because another Web3 product had a much better UX…because as I write this almost none of them do.The Pre-Disastered founders are typically Web3 founders with Web 2.0 experience. These are people who are both experienced builders and invested in the potential and inevitability of Web3 (and not all Web 2.0 people have had time to do this).Pre-Disastered founders have launched products with users in the past. They have real-world experience using things like agile and have seen user-centered design processes in action. They’ve watched usability studies that have made them crumple and want to barf. They’ve had to create documentation and support materials to band-aid confusing features. They’ve complained about bosses who have prioritized new features over improvements. They’ve lived through the cost of not doing user-centered design.Some of the Pre-Disastered are UX and product people with impressive and deep resumes. Interestingly, I’ve found that most of them aren’t writing and talking about Web3. They’re staying off the grid and under the radar on purpose. Anonymity is all the rage with the Web3 elite, for security reasons and because it’s part of the culture.Good user experience and product designers don’t need Web3, so not many of them are exploring it (yet). Like leaping founders, they can exit a window and have 14 offers before they hit the ground from non-Web3 companies.Web 2.0 pros aren’t all grumpy, of course, but they all have a choice. Web 2.0 experts could take gigs where their experience is highly valued, or they could move to Web3, where experience is often seen as a flaw. When you’re in demand where you are, and the ‘new thing’ is technically intimidating, uses a whole new language, and seems super cliquey, why bother?Crypto natives hear about tried-and-true methods that result in better products (babies) and all they are seeing is “people who don’t know our tech and want us to slow down” (bathwater).Pre-disastered founders want to benefit from the experience, but they also face insane pressures to launch and profit.Meanwhile, Web 2.0 grumps are being told that Web3 is potentially more transformative than the internet (babies) but seeing a bunch of noisy hotshots getting money thrown at them to create ways to buy and sell pixelated GIFs for ridiculous prices (bathwater).We’ve seen this combo of inflated promise and hotshot founders before (pretty much daily since 2000). The tech is new. The startup scenario isn’t. (Pro tip: Expensive pixelated GIFs are to NFTs like selling books in 1999 was to e-commerce.)The result of throwing out the babies with the bathwater?I’ve presented one explanation for bad Web3 UX. It’s easy to whine about problems. So, what’s the fix?Product and UX pros who are thinking about Web3:Insights for crypto-natives who want experienced people to help you build better products faster:“Sometimes, you have to let it break.” — Larry Tesler*I’m optimistic the Web3 natives won’t be quite as blind as us Web 2.0 hotshots were. The baby-to-bathwater ratio is objectively higher. The gap between old and new is so much narrower than say between Web1 and magazine publishing and television programing circa 1996, or between traditional retail and catalog and Web 2.0.Old and new are going to have to learn from each other. And they will. Eventually. But I think it’s too early to try to win the hearts and minds of the crypto native founders. First, they have to fail for themselves.This is going to change rapidly (I hope). As it does, the chasm between the wisdom of the recent past and the speed of the future will narrow. For now, I’ve decided to help where help is wanted, even though I know early help from someone like me could be game-changing to any tech startup.More articles for UX people who want to learn about BlockchainMore articles for founders who won’t take my word for itTamara Adlin has been in the UX field for 25 years and co-authored the Persona Lifecycle books.

Echoes of Time, a test of skill and might…","title":"Timemaster’s Epoch","detailed_content":"Testing your skill in speed of completion, this new game mode pits you against the clock. There are 4 new adventures to explore in Inverdhen, and each can be run as a standard adventure, or the more enticing Echoes of Time.You’ll need an initial Sigil from Thornix Stonecarver to activate this mode, depending on the rarity you choose, but as long as you don’t die, you’ll be able to retry as many times as you like, until you succeed and move to the next tier.If you succeed in beating the clock, your sigil will be replaced with the next tier higher, allowing you to compete at the next level!As you progress through the tiers, you’ll find that monsters gain more health and are stronger overall. To really hit a home run in this mode, you’re going to need to use consumables. Fortunately there are a few new items in this update which you can use in your arsenal! Additionally securing yourself a blockchain weapon, will help you make light work of this increased threat!There are a total of 4 tiers for each of the 4 new adventures, starting with Bronze, then Silver, Gold and then Platinum. There is a weekly Time Chest for any player who completes any of the tiers in any of the adventures; however note that you can only win 1 Time Chest per week. The Time Chest will be awarded for the highest rarity adventure you complete within the week and the rarity based on the tier that’s completed.For example if you complete up to Gold Tier in Epic, and then move to Legendary and complete Bronze, you’ll be awarded the Bronze Legendary Time Chest.There are a total of 16 Time Chests, each with increasingly more lucrative rewards. May the RNG be with you!Additionally there’s an overall leaderboard to compete on, with the top 3 players in each rarity receiving an additional prize at the end of the week. The ultimate prize being the Timemaster’s Chest!You’ll need to complete a Quest in Inverdhen before unlocking access to Echoes of Time.The appearance of Armor has been updated, along with it’s effects.The property differences between each tier of Armor has been increased and plate armor vs leather armor has a greater difference depending on your playstyle.If you’re playing mostly ranged, you’re going to want to secure yourself some good quality leather armor, because plate armor, which is great at mitigating incoming damage, isn’t so optimal with ranged energy use.Additionally the new game mode Echoes of Time has a chance to grant rewards which can be taken to Thornix Stonecarver to create even more powerful armor.Finally, when armor breaks, it no longer breaks into Armor Remains, instead it functions the same as all other items that break. This change will help with resource demand in the marketplace.The variety of monsters has expanded to include an additional 24 new monsters! Some monsters have unique abilities which you’ll need to figure out the best way to counter. They might seem daunting at first, but with a little practice you’ll be owning them in no time. Other new monsters will gain additional abilities in the future.The monster population has been spread out across all adventures, with more variety added to every theme. Be sure to take extra consumables and maybe a teleport scroll if you’re revisiting a favorite adventure in this update.Monster damage output has also been revised with this update to better align with the armor and other changes.You’ll be able to unlock the Gem Disaggregator at Inverdhen, giving you the power to extract Shattered Gems from various items. See Thornix Stonecarver in Inverdhen for help with this.These shattered gems have multiple uses, one of which is used to upgrade armor with additional properties.Additionally you can use shattered gems to create a teleport scroll which takes you straight to Inverdhen if you’ve already unlocked it!Some items have been shifted around in Alchemy and Cooking, after their effects have been updated. These changes were made to better align Alchemy and Cooking to the most recent meta changes. You’ll find that fish are for restoring your health and energy, while potions are for buffing your combat.Experience values have also been adjusted to provide a smoother progression curve as you level up your skills, removing the progression curve hills that existed before.Additionally some items have been removed from Alchemy and Cooking to simplify the available recipes. See Old Item Removal and Old Item Swaps below for more information.Untethered Tonic, Spellbreak Potion, and Acceleration Potion have also been updated with a new name and effect (The marketplace listings have been cancelled for you). Untethered Tonic has been changed to Overload Serum, Spellbreak Potion to Bastion Brew, and Acceleration Potion to Precision’s Peak Potion.All Blockchain weapons now have basic effects added to them, in preparation for future expansion through the Weapon Upgrade system. We also added an effect to Emblem of the Ancients.The full list is as follows:Krong’Oul’s Last End Conductor, Shapeshifter’s Demise, Starcaller, Axe of Antagony, Cavalier Crusader, Glint of Asperity, Heartstriker, Incarnated Ravager, Mooncleaver, Night Shredder, Obsidian Defender, Pride of the Fleet, Reaper’s Toll, Silent Song, Sky Spire, Stormsong, Thunderstrike, Valkyrie, Wings of Surety, Axe of the Intolerant, Blade of the Ember Pact, Blood Eclipse, Breeze Bender, Conquest, Doomblade, Fortune’s Warblade, Ghost Reaver, Ice Wrath Cleaver, Long Reign, Obsidian Katana, Ritual Rapier, Silent Assassin, Silver Broadaxe, Silver Saber, Skeletal Warblade, Skull Breaker, Soul Infused Copper Warblade, Viper War Axe, Volcanic Broadaxe, Scathing Ruin, Wildone’s Axe, Refereum Sword, Godslayer and Emblem of the Ancients.Morphs have been upgraded to now stay morphed until you demorph, perform an action, or take damage. There’s no longer a limit to the distance you can travel while morphed, and there’s no time limit that you can stay morphed. Using doors or stairs also no longer demorphs you.The cooldown after demorphing is now always 5s, instead of being scaled to the distance you travelled.Overmorph Potion has also been updated. Once activated, it’ll allow you to instantly morph but at the cost of 50 energy. The effect can be used in town, and lasts for 20 minutes. The 5s cooldown after use still applies.We’ve been working towards a 2 stage integration with Enjin’s Matrixchain. The first tier is complete on our side, which is to allow sending and receiving of ENJ to the game and back. This process has taken far longer than expected because we discovered issues that needed resolving on Matrixchain before we could launch.This update will initially launch with sends/receives turned off, and once we’ve been able to perform further testing, we’ll enable and send out an announcement that it’s ready.Matrixchain also has network fees (whereas JumpNet had none) so be aware of that when you’re sending and receiving your ENJ. (Although they’re far less than they ever were on Ethereum). Additionally the withdraw fee from the game has been set to 0.03 ENJ and the 24 hour cooldown on withdraws has been removed. You are also able to unlink your wallet, however a fee of 10,000 Luneri applies. These fees are in place to discourage certain negative behaviors and to also help pay for ecosystem costs. They may be reviewed in the future but we believe they’re set appropriately.You’ll also notice that Shadowstones have been removed. We’ve completely replaced all reference to Shadowstones with Enjin Coin and updated how we display the value. So before, if you had 530 Shadowstones, you needed to divide that by 100 to know that you had 5.3 ENJ. From now on though, you’ll no longer need to do this, as the value in game will simply show 5.3 Enjin Coin.Please take care as you trade on the marketplace, as your muscle memory may want you to type 100, instead of 1. Double check everything until you’re used to the new values!Shadowstones that you found within the game are now represented as Enjin Gems. These were always separate internally, but they’re now distinct, because it’s a little confusing that you could send some of your Shadowstones out of the game, but others needed to be used in the market first. Now it’s very clear that if you have Enjin Gems, you must spend them in the marketplace. (This value is still only displayed under the Enjin Coin tooltip at the top of the screen)The 2nd stage of integration with Matrixchain will be recreating all of the items. This 2nd stage will be launched at a later date, once we’re happy with the performance and reliability of Matrixchain and we’ve heard your feedback about the whole process.The interface displayed when interacting with NPCs who exchange items with you has been improved to align better with the existing interfaces.Additionally some NPCs now have additional items available for exchange!Due to the upcoming new content, we found it necessary to rebalance certain items, as some were either too weak or too strong.Instead of attempting to adjust each individual item, we have made the decision to remove them altogether. We appreciate your understanding that such adjustments may occur during the early stages of development.To express our gratitude, if you had any of the affected items, we have credited you Gold Coins based on how many old items you held, and additional bonuses depending on how many of the items you held.The affected items are:Protection Potion, Swiftness Potion, Brute Force Potion, Antirange Potion, Dynalyte Potion, Fortification Potion, Raw Hock and Hock.You’ll receive a gift containing the gold and any bonuses.

It provides an infrastructure for developers to build protocols that can be utilized by fund managers and accessed by the retail investor population in a seamless manner.A $100 million ecosystem fund, supported by DWF Labs, has been established to incentivize developers to build on ZIGChain. With each new protocol, we get closer to our goal of enabling wealth generation for everyone.Wealth generation describes the process of creating, growing, and preserving financial resources. It usually involves “making money work for you” through smart investments that generate consistent returns over time. Sounds simple enough, right?Not in reality. Traditional financial systems have made it almost impossible for the average person to access wealth-generation opportunities. As a result, the wealth gap continues to widen, with 1.10% of the world’s adult population controlling 46% of global wealth, as of 2023.The factors contributing to the global wealth gap can be categorized into:Zignaly has spent six years attempting to address the limited access to wealth-generation opportunities. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we expand financial opportunities globally while remaining inclusive, user-friendly, and compliant with regulatory bodies.Hundreds of thousands of our users have collectively generated millions of dollars in profits by investing alongside top digital asset managers. The user-friendly interface and various sets of tools allow investors to make all of the profit with none of the stress.But we are just one wealth generation protocol. Imagine if hundreds of similar protocols were available to the masses. Imagine if there was an infrastructure that made it easy for builders to create these protocols and for users to access them. Well, that infrastructure is here…Introducing ZIGChain, a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain on the Cosmos Network, designed to revolutionize financial empowerment through scalable and inclusive wealth generation infrastructure.Developers can build innovative wealth generation protocols, fund managers can deploy them into accessible investment strategies, and the average person can take advantage of financial opportunities previously reserved for the wealthy elite — all on ZIGChain.ZIGChain unlocks a world where any user, regardless of financial literacy, social status, or geographic location, can generate wealth by clicking a single button. Wealth management services can now be built on top of any DeFi protocol, so users get all the benefits of Web3 but with a familiar and user-friendly interface.Let’s find out how ZIGChain’s architecture simplifies wealth generation.ZIGChain is being built on the powerful Cosmos SDK as a modular blockchain. Today, Cosmos is one of the fastest-growing infrastructures for new Layer 1 blockchain with high scalability, interoperability, and an easy-to-implement modular framework.Cosmos is a proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain that involves staking to secure the network and validate transactions. So yes, we can finally confirm that ZIG holders will be able to stake tokens for huge rewards, and we are excited to share more details on this very soon.Choosing Cosmos enables a fast transition from idea to implementation while maintaining reliability. The developer-friendly tools and libraries in the Cosmos SDK make it the ideal choice for launching a blockchain that values security, flexibility, and speed.Moreover, the modular framework means ZIGChain’s functionality can be integrated in the core of the blockchain and expanded to meet users’ and developers’ evolving needs. It also allows seamless integration with existing blockchain ecosystems, creating a powerful network effect.Cosmos enables us to deploy an “app-chain” design that allows our core concepts of accessibility, transparency, and inclusivity to form a wealth management layer (WML) that sits between builders and the everyday investor.This WML is the DeFi manifestation of Ziganly’s pooled accounts investment technology whereby users may choose to pool their funds with expert wealth managers who manage their investments. Here are just a few of the benefits that this app-chain design enables on ZIGChain:“Effortless investing” has been our motto since Day 1. So, it shouldn’t be a surprise that ZIGChain has a user-friendly UX that enables anyone to participate in wealth generation practices without prior knowledge or expertise.But such a seamless user experience doesn’t mean a lack of advanced features. ZIGChain comes equipped with new-age technologies, including account abstraction and Gasless technology, to make Web2 and Web3 composability a reality.ZIGChain opens the door to a future where just one button stands between a user and wealth generation. Soon, Web2 users will use their email accounts or social logins to integrate with on-chain protocols and invest in wealth management services by clicking a single “INVEST” button.Zignaly and DWF Labs have joined forces to establish a $100 million ecosystem fund to promote the adoption of ZIGChain. The fund will primarily incentivize and support developers in creating innovative wealth-generation protocols on ZIGChain. We are also joined by UDHC, Disrupt \u0026 score of other partners in this journey.Our message to our fellow builders is simple:The support for builders on ZIGChain doesn’t stop there. Developers will be prioritized in our network’s resource allocation and rewarded with a share of the core blockchain revenue. Such an approach ensures the growth and sustainability of our ecosystem as a whole.Moreover, ZIGChain is partnering with various entities to enable smart contract functionalities, both EVM and Rust, on the L1. Developers of all levels and backgrounds can build wealth-generation protocols on ZIGChain without sacrificing creativity or innovation.ZIGChain marks the beginning of a new chapter in Zignaly’s journey. A testnet version of ZIGChain will be launched this summer, with more details on the overall governance structure and incentive programs for early contributors, validators, and users to follow in the upcoming weeks.With major partnerships being forged, ZIGChain, as a shared mindset of some of the biggest names in the industry, is set to disrupt the status quo and usher in a new era of financial freedom for everyone — and it’s all happening in 2024.","tags":["Blockchain","Zignaly","Bitcoin","Defi","Decentralization"],"author":"Zignaly"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@ixplorer/blue-check-map-and-future-tech-mr-creating-a-new-dimension-in-retail-and-entertainment-43d9bae71219","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"In our last episode, I discussed how spaces collaborating with our service are marked with a Blue Check.

We’ve come to call this collection of spaces the “Blue Check Map.” Today, I want to share why I continue to expand this map and the long-term goals we have at HIDE ME PLEASE inc.Innovating Future Retail and Entertainment with the Blue Check Map and MR(Mixed Reality)Recent technology has been blurring the lines between our daily lives and societal boundaries, transforming our experiences. At HIDE ME PLEASE inc., we’re at the forefront of this change, using the Blue Check Map to integrate online and offline experiences through a new dimension of interaction. Consider how ‘Pokémon Go’ has globally motivated people to move between real locations, blending digital and real-world experiences. Our MR (Mixed Reality) experience is designed similarly, enabling users to engage directly in virtual interactions through the Blue Check Marks. For instance, when consumers using MR devices look at the entrance of a café adorned with a Blue Check, they can vividly experience the venue’s current promotions or signature dishes. Furthermore, by analyzing consumer purchase data and behaviors, we can offer personalized recommendations and tailored services, enhancing both customer attraction and marketing efficiency. MR technology not only transcends simple visits but also strengthens connections with the venues, elevating customer experiences to a new level.Commercialization Is Just Around the CornerMR devices are evolving into lighter, more user-friendly glasses. Companies like Meta and Apple are already developing this technology, which is on the verge of widespread commercialization. As mentioned, wearing smart glasses and looking at a Blue Check will display the venue’s signature and promotional menus directly on the screen. Additionally, these interactions can generate advertising revenue, which will be shared with our partner venues.A Win-Win for Venue Operators and ConsumersThe introduction of the Blue Check Map and MR technology brings significant changes to businesses. First, customer visitation increases due to the enhanced experiences provided by MR. This technology encourages more frequent visits and longer stays at venues. Second, these unique interactions are likely to be shared on social media, attracting more new customers and naturally inducing viral marketing. Lastly, the special experiences offered can prompt customers to purchase more products or services. As discussed in previous episodes, if my offline activities are linked online — imagine gaining experience points or items for your avatar online after enjoying a coffee at a venue. Wouldn’t you be tempted to order a dessert if it meant your online avatar would receive even greater rewards?The Future of MR and HIDE ME PLEASEThe expansion of MR experiences through the Blue Check Map will bring revolutionary changes to the retail and entertainment industries. We are ready to enhance customer experiences in unprecedented ways by partnering with a variety of businesses across sectors. As MR technology advances and becomes more accessible, our platform will establish more diverse and extensive partnerships. We aim to provide novel experiences at retail stores, restaurants, tourist attractions, and more. The increasing number of businesses adopting this technology through collaboration with the Blue Check Map will maximize the value of our services and add new enjoyment to customers’ daily lives. Looking ahead, we are prepared to build sustainable and valuable partnerships and are seeking sturdy partners and investors who share and support our vision. The future of MR is bright, and HIDE ME PLEASE inc. is committed to leading the way.In our next episode, I will talk about connecting the HIDE ME PLEASE service with gaming.Thank you for reading today, and I truly look forward to any interest in our business.

By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of blockchain technology and a simple blockchain that you can build upon and customize to your own needs.A blockchain consists of several key components:In this section, we will create a simple blockchain in Python to demonstrate how blockchain technology works.The first step is to import the required libraries. We will be using the hashlib library to create a cryptographic hash of the blocks, and the datetime library to timestamp each block.Next, we will create a Block class that will define the structure of each block in the blockchain. Each block will have the following attributes:Now, we will create a Blockchain class that will define the structure of the blockchain. Each blockchain will have the following attributes:Now that we have defined the Block and Blockchain classes, let’s test our blockchain by creating some blocks and adding them to the chain.As we can see, the blockchain has been successfully created and we have added some blocks to it. The hash of each block is based on the data of the block and the hash of the previous block, which ensures the integrity and security of the blockchain.In this article, we have learned about the concept of blockchain and how it works. We have also created a simple blockchain using Python and explained each step in detail. Although this implementation is very basic and is not suitable for use in real-world applications, it provides a good foundation for further learning and understanding blockchain technology.✨ check for more interesting articles","tags":["Blockchain","Blockchain Development","Blockchain Technology","Cryptocurrency","Decentralized"],"author":"Aarafat Islam","creation_date":"2023-02-18"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@0xdtx/join-dtx-trading-competition-to-earn-5-000-blast-gold-a0a9d4ccb4f2","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"GM Traders","title":"Join DTX Trading Competition to Earn 5,000 Blast Gold!","detailed_content":"GM TradersGet ready for a Blast Gold extravaganza!

Here’s how we could fix it.","title":"Six Ideas to Rescue Higher Education","detailed_content":"College is a lubricant of social mobility, a vaccine against a creeping caste system, and a key that unlocks the American dream. Yet over the past 40 years, it’s become more difficult to access and more expensive, staying more the “same” (i.e., stale) than nearly any offering. We can scale social media platforms from thousands to billions of users, turn Porsches into SUVs, and lift billions of people out of poverty globally, but we can’t shape a college education beyond a four-year tour of auditoriums and projectors.The sector is ripe for disruption. In any other industry, innovators would have moved in long ago. But higher education is different: It’s got iconic brands (Apple and Coca-Cola have nothing on Stanford and MIT), a self-policing “accreditation” system, and an unholy alliance with the financial industry ($1.7 trillion in student loan debt). So things keep getting worse. And the worst of the worst are the elite schools, who’ve doubled down on their rejectionist cultures even as their endowments have exploded. The share of the student population enrolled at elite schools has been declining for decades. “Let’s build something wonderful, so we can share it with almost nobody,” said every Ivy League President. #Gross.A bright spot? Our great public universities. For example, the University of California, which recently set a goal to add 20,000 more seats by 2030. But the sun of UC’s good intentions has experienced a partial eclipse of Nimbyism (Nimby \u003d not in my backyard). This town-gown dispute is indicative of the challenges facing higher ed, and our country.UC Berkeley has expanded its enrollment just 1.3% per year since I graduated in the nineties. More Berkeley grads is good for California, America, and the world. Berkeley boasts the second most Nobel Prize winners of all U.S. universities, produces the most Peace Corps volunteers, and is the nation’s fourth-largest manufacturer of Olympic medalists.However … more UC Berkeley doesn’t appeal to some Berkeley residents, who like the cultural accoutrements of a college town, just not college students or the housing they need. In 2019, the City of Berkeley and a neighborhood group sued to freeze the school’s enrollment.The city and the university cut a deal: UC Berkeley agreed to pay $82.6 million to the city over 16 years (double its previously planned payout) to account for the increased burden on city services, and the city dropped its lawsuits and endorsed the university’s growth. Seems reasonable.Except that the neighborhood group wasn’t satisfied with 80 million bucks. It continued its lawsuit and won — relying on an environmental law from the 1970s that observers say was never meant to police population growth, let alone higher education. The kicker? The enrollment “baseline” year is 2020, when enrollment cratered, thanks to the pandemic, so the freeze will require the university to cut 3,000 students (2,000 undergrads and 1,000 graduates) from its anticipated 2022–23 enrollment. To minimize the reductions, Berkeley will tell more than a thousand new undergrads they have to take their first semester online and require another 600 to defer until 2023.The median sale price for a home in Berkeley is $1.6 million, nearly four times the national average. And prices keep going up (12% in the last year). Berkeley homeowners are the beneficiaries of a long economic boom — a boom that came in no small part courtesy of UC Berkeley’s graduates and researchers. On the other side of the backyard fence, UC Berkeley and its students are the arbiters of change, the potential for a better future. But what we witness incessantly in America is people who’ve benefited from our innovation economy pulling the ladder up behind them.In 1940 a 37-year-old had a 92% chance of earning more than their parents did at the same age; a 37-year-old today has a 50% chance. It’s never been more expensive to buy a home. Since 1989, young people’s wealth relative to their income has declined, while older people’s has grown. Put another way, the old are getting richer and the young poorer.And while the younger generation is down, we boomers continue to kick them. Today, two-thirds of jobs require a postsecondary education and training, but college costs have increased 150% faster than average earnings of 22- to 27-year-olds since 1980. We spend 7% of our federal budget on children — the only OECD nation that spends less on kids is Turkey.Old people don’t want change. They want scarcity and ossification, because it protects what they have. Young people are different — they want churn and growth, so they, too, can go buy a nice house and turn into Nimbyists.In Berkeley, it’s likely California will carve an exception to the law for the UC system, but housing for students is still in critically short supply, and next year there will be another battle, another lawsuit. We can’t scale America’s colleges one lawsuit at a time.College towns are victims of their own success, bringing character and culture that benefit residents who register appreciation — and then want to create a scarcity ecosystem that will further buttress their wealth and lifestyle. University leaders need to adapt to a scarcity mindset in which companies, graduates, and homeowners all want less access once they have theirs.Some ideas…You know who would welcome 50,000 of California’s brightest students and most-accomplished researchers? Fresno. Or Davis. Or Bakersfield. Any town north of Sacramento or east of Los Angeles. Governor Newsom, if you want an unlock, build a campus in Fresno. Build a high-speed rail system from Fresno to the Bay Area and weave the tech industry into a new community.That’s just a start. Our elite private schools have become enamored with satellite campuses, but they’re mostly fond of the checks autocratic regimes are willing to write to wrap themselves in the comfortable blanket of academic credibility. Building a satellite campus in Abu Dhabi (my employer’s innovation) is arbitraging the brand, not expanding the franchise. Same goes for most executive education, where a mid-level manager gets her company to pay $30,000 for six days across two on-campus “immersions” during a “multi-modal” experience so she can post a Chief Digital Officer certification from Kellogg/Penn/Columbia on her LinkedIn profile. Big Ed(ucation) is beginning to make Big Tech seem noble.The elite should be building campuses in places that would welcome the investment instead of filing lawsuits — cities such as Albuquerque, Cleveland, Tulsa, etc. This would diversify the elite’s currently cloistered experience, worldview, and politics. Meanwhile, doubling a city’s degree production increases local human capital levels by 7%. Household incomes in college towns are 7.4% higher than in noncollege towns. Jesus, what could a second MIT do for Mississippi?I wrote in New York magazine in 2020 that the truly elite universities would leverage their brand equity and technology to scale and consolidate the market. I could not have been more wrong. A rejectionist, Hermès-style positioning is their drug of choice, and they are speedballing the sleet.Lean into the online-hybrid model. We tried this during Covid, and it worked … sort of. The missing ingredient from college in 2020 was socialization. But there’s no reason to believe that would disappear if we moved classes online. In 2011, 87% of college students lived off campus, and that didn’t stop them from going to bars, dating, and forming special-interest groups. Nineteen-year-olds aren’t good at much, but they’re great at getting their hearts broken, getting drunk and high, and having unprotected sex … at scale. Life finds a way. We tend to speak in binary terms: traditional experience or all online. It will be a mix. If we took 33% of our classes online (and we can), we could increase capacity by 50%. But this can’t be an afterthought or an emergency measure — distance education done well requires investment and new skills.Here’s a pedestrian fix: Go the way of Dartmouth — quarterly.Most college campuses sit near-empty for three months a year, an egregious waste of capital investment. But Dartmouth’s quarterly calendar means undergraduate classes continue throughout the summer. This makes sense; summer vacation is a relic we inherited from previous generations whose buildings didn’t have AC and who needed their kids to come home to work on the family farm.A key to increasing seats may be to transfer the costs of college from students to corporations. The average cost of hiring an employee is $4,000. Why not lump those recruiting costs into a subsidy partnership with a university and provide early access to young talent? This would let talent-hungry companies build a pipeline from campus to HQ. Transfer the costs and burdens of career centers to the companies that benefit from them.Some companies are already doing it: Starbucks started teaming up with Arizona State University in 2015 — its applicant pool increased by more than half a million, and 63% of new hires expressed interest in the partnership.Could we put higher ed on the blockchain? Could a university rethink its relationship with the community and tie access to a token? Something like this: Stanford mints 100,000 tokens and auctions them to the public. Each Cardinal Coin gives the bearer unique access to the Stanford community: a vote on major policy changes, entrance to sporting and cultural events, and a seat in any Stanford degree-granting program (subject to minimum standards). Every January 1, another 3,000 coins — no more — are minted and sold at auction. Say, the first trade of the coin offering is at $1 million to $10 million a coin. If you have two kids, you’re looking at savings of nearly $500,000 in tuition alone, and the access would create a bidding war for a store of value that would also attract speculative investors.What would guaranteed admission, tuition, alumni events, community access, etc. be worth? Let’s be conservative and peg the value at the lower end, $1 million per coin. This translates to $100 billion in new capital, with another $3 billion in revenue coming in every year thereafter. That quadruples the endowment, increases investment income, and lowers costs (admissions and development departments would no longer be needed). Unrivaled capital to open satellite campuses, invest in the next generation of distance learning tech, or just build more dorms.Would this turn Stanford into the exclusive preserve of the wealthy? Elite universities already are. The wealthy game the system with multimillion-dollar donations (aka the Kushner Krush) or try to bribe someone (Aunt Becky). The Cardinal Coin, putting this all out in the open, could facilitate diversity and merit-based aid. Philanthropists could (will) purchase coins and assign the rights associated with them however they choose — to kids from low-income households with strong academic achievement, or to unremarkable kids raised by single mothers who show promise but could never get into a school that now only admits 9% of applicants, vs. 74% when I applied. #GoBruins.This was a suggestion from Stig Leschly.Any naval personnel meeting basic requirements can show up to SEAL tryouts, but the program starts tough and gets tougher — admissions by attrition.What if an elite university had an adjunct campus that implemented the academic equivalent of SEAL training? No admissions department — whoever makes it through the first semester is admitted. Wouldn’t this also create fierce, resilient, strong capitalist warriors? Warriors chosen for their skills, strength, and grit vs. who their parents are?The tip of the spear for America, higher education, has become markedly less American over the past several decades. We need massive investment and a rejection of the rejectionist and scarcity mindset to return higher ed to its rightful place as an upward lubricant for kids whose parents aren’t rich and who haven’t peaked at 17. We also need to expect more from university leaders, who’ve had little incentive to innovate or rock the boat. Technology is not the key element for the requisite innovation; class traitors are. Deans and chancellors who push back on faculty and alumni and the dangerous notion that we are luxury brands, not public servants.Also, Berkeley homeowners, stop it. Just stop it.Life is so rich,P.S. I started Section4 to give people greater access to business education and the network that comes with it. We’ve got plans to expand that access even further — look out for big news from us next week.","tags":[],"author":"Scott Galloway","creation_date":"2022-03-14"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/cyfrin/deploy-scripts-are-now-in-scope-for-smart-contract-audits-7fbb95788ce7","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"As we see more and more exploits coming from the developer operations side of security, we need to start addressing this issue head-on…","title":"Deploy scripts are now in scope for smart contract audits","detailed_content":"In the last ~30 days (since I started writing this), rekt.news has reported on three exploits in Web3, with smart contract developer operations (a.k.a. “DevOps”) being the categorized issue.With many more happening historically.We can determine a common pattern in these exploits by looking into each issue.Note: I’m simplifying complex attacks and am not placing fault anywhere on doing/not doing something. However, we need to use every exploit in web3 as a chance for us to improve, and the way to do that is to implement new standards on how security is to be done in web3.This smart contract could be exploited by a private key leak because of two true scenarios.Ownable and Upgradeable smart contracts have been controversial for some time, but we will not address that in this post. If you do choose to have an Ownable or Upgradeable smart contract, you need to make sure you take measures in case one of your private keys is leaked.The issue here was with the developer operations (DevOps) of the protocol.This could have been prevented if the contract owner had been a 2 of 3 multi-sig. Having the deploy script automatically transfer ownership to the multi-sig would have been easy to add and verify.This exploit, in particular, happened where the codebase had zero security reviews (as far as I know) and could have helped prevent this, too.This next attack had a similar scenario, except that the key wasn’t leaked, but instead, a rouge employee had access to the smart contract and manipulated it for their gain. This, again, was on a smart contract that was:One might argue that the real issue here was the rouge employee. This might be true, but there are ways to mitigate even this scenario.Unlike our first exploit, this did undergo an audit (password: “ESMunc@24!”), and they called out the traditional “Centralized Risk for Trusted Owners” issue. However, this issue is ignored by almost every protocol on every audit.The issue here was with the developer operations (DevOps) of the protocol.If, in addition, this contract had the deploy script in scope, the security team could have verified that the contract’s ownership was going to be transferred immediately to a multi-sig, which could have potentially prevented this attack. If the rouge employee had only 1 of the many keys, then this attack could still have been prevented. The auditor on this codebase could have very well told this protocol not to use an EOA for the owner of the contract, but since the deploy script isn’t in scope, it doesn’t show up on the audit report.Of course, doing due diligence on the employee would have helped here, too. But a much easier solution would have been to add the transfer of ownership to being in-scope on the audit report.The last attack here had nothing to do with private keys leaking but, instead, with an upgrade that introduced a vulnerability. The codebase had been previously audited; however, no such security review had been done on the upgrade itself.The upgrade introduced an issue, and boom, attacks ensued.The issue here was with the developer operations (DevOps) of the protocol.Additionally, we take the time to go through deployment and upgrade scripts on a number of Cyfrin audits even when they are out of scope. Doing so, on more than one occasion, has led us to issues with the codebase or the protocol’s understanding of where attack vectors are and required their deployment scripts to be modified.On a personal note, any time I see someone firing their smart contract into production without testing their deployments, it feels like they are putting a blindfold on, screaming “YOLO,” and praying to whatever deity they believe in that the deployment “just works”. This is unacceptable for web3 to continue and scale. Which is why I chose the thumbnail as seen here:And finally, we’ve seen maliciousFor some time, we’ve taught on Cyfrin Updraft that codebases should always include their deploy scripts in their test suite, but we think we need the Web3 security community to introduce a few new standards into our audit practice (if you’re not already following this).These three additions to all security reviews and a protocol’s security checklist will help prevent these in the future. Moving forward, all protocols and security researchers should add these checks to their process, including competitive audits.Let me now get ahead of some rebuttals to adding these checks.“But Patrick, we don’t need this because….”At this point in Web3, there is a good chance that you can take every precaution and still get hacked. If you accept this scenario, then you need to be able to have contingency plans in place for when that happens. Most protocols have some emergency powers, such as the Compound Pause Guardian.If a single simple-to-implement solution can address a wide range of downstream issues, then we should absolutely implement it.Convince them. You can use the three examples above or any other hacks that have come from private key leaks or botched scripting.You’ll need to stop doing that.Go to Cyfrin Updraft and finish the “Advanced Foundry” curriculum, we teach you how to do this.To learn smart contract security and development, visit Cyfrin UpdraftTo request security support/security review for your smart contract project visit Cyfrin.io or CodeHawks.com.To learn more about top reported attacks in smart contracts, be sure to study up on Solodit.","tags":["Smart Contract Security","Smart Contract Auditing","Blockchain","Cybersecurity","Smart Contracts"],"author":"Patrick Collins","creation_date":"2024-05-01"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@magape/charting-the-future-of-gaming-magapes-product-roadmap-850b8c611c93","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"MagApe’s product roadmap serves as the guiding force behind our initiatives, steering us towards the ever-evolving landscape of gaming…","title":"Charting the Future of Gaming: MagApe’s Product Roadmap","detailed_content":"MagApe’s product roadmap serves as the guiding force behind our initiatives, steering us towards the ever-evolving landscape of gaming.

Because of the logic of the blockchain, every transaction is public. If you have some ETH on your account, you cannot transfer it anonymously, because anybody can follow your transaction history on the blockchain. Coin mixers, like Tornado Cash, can solve this privacy problem by breaking the on-chain link between the source and the destination address by using ZKP.If you want to anonymize one of your transactions, you have to deposit a small amount of ETH (or ERC20 token) on the Tornado Cash contract (ex.: 1 ETH). After a little while, you can withdraw this 1 ETH with a different account. The trick is that nobody can create a link between the depositor account and the withdrawal account. If hundreds of accounts deposit 1 ETH on one side and the other hundreds of accounts withdraw 1 ETH on the other side, then nobody will be able to follow the path where the money moves. The technical challenge is that smart contract transactions are also public like any other transaction on the Ethereum network. This is the point where ZKP will be relevant.When you deposit your 1 ETH on the contract, you have to provide a “commitment”. This commitment is stored by the smart contract. When you withdraw 1 ETH on the other side, you have to provide a “nullifier” and a zero-knowledge proof. The nullifier is a unique ID that is in connection with the commitment and the ZKP proves the connection, but nobody knows which nullifier is assigned to which commitment (except the owner of the depositor/withdrawal account).Again: We can prove that one of the commitments is assigned to our nullifier, without revealing our commitment.The nullifiers are tracked by the smart contract, so we can withdraw only one deposited ETH with one nullifier.Sounds easy? It’s not! :) Let’s go deep inside the technology. But before anything, we have to understand another tricky thing, the Merkle tree.Merkle trees are hash trees, where the leaves are the elements, and every node is a hash of the child nodes. The root of the tree is the Merkle root, which represents the whole set of elements. If you add, remove, or change any element (leaf) in the tree, the Merkle root will change. The Merkle root is a unique identifier of the set of elements. But how can we use it?There is another thing called Merkle proof. If I have a Merkle root, you can send me a Merkle proof that proves that an element is in the set that is represented by the root. The figure below shows how is it working. If you want to prove to me that HK is in the set, you have to send me the HL, HIJ, HMNOP, and HABCDEFGH hashes. Using these hashes I can calculate the Merkle root. If the root is the same as my root then HK is in the set. Where can we use it?A simple example is whitelisting. Imagine a smart contract that has a method that can be called by only whitelisted users. The problem is that there are 1000 whitelisted accounts. How can you store them on the smart contract? The simple way is to store every account in mapping, but it is very expensive. A cheaper solution is building a Merkle tree, and storing the Merkle root only (1 hash vs 1000 is not bad). If somebody wants to call the method she has to give a Merkle proof (in this case it is a list of 10 hashes) that can be easily validated by the smart contract.Again: A Merkle tree is used to represent a set of elements with one hash (the Merkle root). The existence of an element can be proven by the Merkle proof.The next thing that we have to understand is the zero-knowledge proof itself. With ZKP, you can prove that you know something without revealing the thing that you know. For generating a ZKP, you need a circuit. A circuit is something like a small program that has public inputs and outputs, and private inputs. These private inputs are the knowledge that you don’t reveal for the verification, this is why it is called zero-knowledge proof. With ZKP, we can prove that the output can be generated from the inputs with the given circuit.A simple circuit looks like this:Using this circuit, we can prove that we know the source of the given hash. This circuit has one input (the nullifier) and one output (the nullifier hash). The default accessibility of the inputs is private, and the outputs are always public. This circuit uses 2 libraries from the Circomlib. Circomlib is a set of useful circuits. The first library is bitlify that contains bit manipulation methods, and the second is pedersen which contains the Pedersen hasher. Pedersen hashing is a hashing method that can be run efficiently in ZKP circuits. In the body of the Main template, we fill the hasher and calculate the hash. (For more info about the circom language, please take a look at the circom documentation)For generating the zero-knowledge proof, you will need a proving key. This is the most sensitive part of ZKP because using the source data that is used to generate the proving key, anybody could generate fake proofs. This source data is called the “toxic waste” that has to be dropped. Because of this, there is a “ceremony” for generating the proving key. The ceremony has many members and every member contribute to the proving key. Only one non-malicious member is enough to generate a valid proving key. Using the private inputs, the public inputs, and the proving key, the ZKP system can run the circuit and generate the Proof and the outputs.There is a validation key for the proving key that can be used for the validation. The validation system uses the public inputs, the outputs, and the validation key to validate the proof.Snarkjs is a full-featured tool to generate the proving key and the verification key by the ceremony, generate the proof, and validate it. It can also generate a smart contract for the verification, that can be used by any other contract to validate the zero-knowledge proof. For more information, please look at the snarkjs documentation.Now, we have everything to understand how Tornado Cash (TC) works. When you deposit 1 ETH on the TC contract, you have to provide a commitment hash. This commitment hash will be stored in a Merkle tree. When you withdraw this 1 ETH with a different account, you have to provide 2 zero-knowledge proofs. The first proves that the Merkel tree contains your commitment. This proof is a zero-knowledge proof of a Merkle proof. But this is not enough, because you should be allowed to withdraw this 1 ETH only once. Because of this, you have to provide a nullifier that is unique for the commitment. The contract stores this nullifier, this ensures that you don’t be able to withdraw the deposited money more than one time.The uniqueness of the nullifier is ensured by the commitment generation method. The commitment is generated from the nullifier and a secret by hashing. If you change the nullifier then the commitment will change, so one nullifier can be used for only one commitment. Because of the one-way nature of hashing, it’s not possible to link the commitment and the nullifier, but we can generate a ZKP for it.After the theory, let’s see how the withdraw circuit of TC looks like:The first template is the CommitmentHasher. It has two inputs, the nullifier and the secret which are two random 248-bit numbers. The template calculates the nullifier hash and the commitment hash which is a hash of the nullifier and the secret as I wrote before.The second template is the Withdraw itself. It has 2 public inputs, the Merkle root, and the nullifierHash. The Merkle root is needed to verify the Merkle proof, and the nullifierHash is needed by the smart contract to store it. The private input parameters are the nullifier, the secret, and the pathElements and pathIndices of the Merkle proof. The circuit checks the nullifier by generating the commitment from it and from the secret and also checks the given Merkle proof. If everything is fine, the zero-knowledge proof will be generated that can be validated by the TC smart contract.You can find the smart contracts in the contracts folder in the repo. The Verifier is generated from the circuit. It is used by the Tornado contract to verify the ZKP for the given nullifier hash and Merkle root.The easiest way to use the contract is the command-line interface. It is written in JavaScript, and its source code is relatively simple. You can easily find where the parameters and the ZKP are generated and used to call the smart contract.Zero-knowledge proof is relatively new in the crypto world. The math behind it is really complex and hard to understand, but tools like snarkjs and circom make it easy to use. I hope, this article helps you to understand this “magical” technology, and you can use ZKP in your next project.Happy coding…UPDATE: I have a new article about the topic:And another article about how I built a JavaScript library for anonymous voting based on the source code of Tornado Cash.

Amidst our exploration of diverse solutions, we established connections with developers who quickly recognized the potential of our technology. It was through these collaborations that we found ourselves presented with a unique opportunity: the chance to develop Web3 games leveraging the renowned Ragnarok IP.Viewing this opportunity as both a challenge and a fresh avenue for innovation, we eagerly embraced the task at hand. With our expertise in blockchain solutions as our foundation, we set out to craft groundbreaking games that would push the boundaries of the market.Numerous blockchain games have entered the market fray, yet those exclusively targeting Web3 audiences have faltered in gathering a sizable user base, hampered by the limited number of Web3 gamers. On the other hand, Web 2.5 games have struggled to cater to the distinct needs of both Web2 and Web3 users, often falling short of capturing either demographic effectively. Our observation led us to a fundamental belief: the success of blockchain games hinges on their ability to cater to the diverse requirements of both Web2 and Web3 users.Reflecting on the existing gaming landscape, we identified a critical gap — a lack of cohesion between the needs of gamers and investors. Our analysis led us to a stark realization: “Gamers don’t invest, investors don’t play the game.” While Web2 players seek a gaming experience devoid of heavy investment commitments, Web3 investors prioritize their financial endeavors, acknowledging the potential for substantial returns when coupled with active gameplay participation. Recognizing the symbiotic relationship between gamers and investors, we concluded that a thriving ecosystem must bridge this divide, offering a seamless connection between the two groups.With this insight in mind, our mission was to cultivate an ecosystem that addresses the needs of both gamers and investors while fostering collaboration and mutual benefit. Our vision is clear: to build a dynamic environment where players and investors converge, enriching the gaming experience and unlocking new opportunities for growth and innovation.Set with a clear objective, our strategy crystallized into three key pillars:1. Harnessing the Power of Ragnarok IP:Fortunately, the Ragnarok IP boasts a steadfast fanbase, ensuring our ability to draw in existing enthusiasts and establish an initial player base. To deepen engagement with these fans, we opted to preserve the distinctive ambiance of Ragnarok within our game, fostering a sense of nostalgia and familiarity. At the heart of our game lie the iconic Ragnarok monsters — Ragmons, carefully chosen as the focal characters due to their diverse designs and undeniable appeal. We recognized the potential of these creatures to thrive in the realm of NFT gaming, inspiring users to embark on a quest to collect them all.Moreover, the charm and charisma exuded by the multitude of Ragnarok monsters, honed over years within the Ragnarok IP, resonate with both new and existing fans alike. This appeal extends beyond aesthetics, as we sought to integrate core elements from the original Ragnarok IP, including its class system, into our game. By infusing user characters with distinct appearances and abilities, we aim to captivate new players while evoking fond memories for seasoned enthusiasts.2. Pioneering Web3 Integration:The fervent following of the Ragnarok universe is undeniable. Enthusiasts of all stripes, drawn to its rich lore and captivating world, eagerly explore new iterations of the Ragnarok IP, transcending genre boundaries. Harnessing the power of this dedicated fanbase, we are poised to leverage the Ragnarok IP in multifaceted ways, capturing the attention of existing devotees from the outset.As user pool is acquired, game’s ecosystem expands which eventually leads to the possibility of increase in token value — a testament to the symbiotic relationship between user base and investment potential. Recognizing that success in the gaming realm hinges on a robust and engaged community, we sought to forge a deeper connection between gamers and investors. To achieve this, we devised a novel approach: empowering high community involved investors with the option to join DAO.The Ragnarok: Monster World DAO serves as the foundational element of Ragmon’s governance structure, overseeing its various facets. This collaborative endeavor not only enhances user engagement but also fosters a dynamic exchange of ideas, enriching the gaming experience for all involved. With investors directly contributing to the creation of richer content, the value of the token and the success of their investment stand to flourish.3. Bridging the Divide:Our efforts don’t halt in flourishing each side of users; we endeavor to bridge the gap between disparate user groups, enabling investors to embrace gaming and gamers to delve into investment opportunities. By facilitating the seamless transition from player to investor and vice versa, we aimed to amplify both the enjoyment and rewards experienced by all.The crux of our vision lies in enabling users of varying backgrounds and preferences to appreciate each other’s contributions, thereby multiplying their collective rewards. For gamers, the allure of wielding Ragmon NFTs, capable of tipping the scales in battle serves as a potent incentive. As their desire for these exclusive assets grows, so too does their inclination to invest in on-chain Ragnarok NFTs, thus embarking on their journey on Web3 as investors.To further democratize users access to the Web3 realm, we adjusted pricing structures to favor token usage over traditional payment option. This strategic move ensures that participating in Web3 gaming remains financially viable for all, fostering inclusivity and accessibility.From the investor’s standpoint, leveraging powerful NFTs acquired through investment endeavors not only bolsters their chances of victory but also augments their potential rewards. This synergy between investment and gameplay incentivizes investors to actively engage in the gaming experience, ultimately fostering a deeper connection with the platform.Given our primary strategy of tapping into the passionate Ragnarok IP fanbase to establish a robust user base, we strategically focused our efforts on regions where the IP enjoys immense popularity. Currently, Southeast Asia stands out as the epicenter of Ragnarok fandom, boasting a plethora of themed events and merchandise industries. It was evident that Southeast Asia held immense potential as our primary target market.In light of this, we made a deliberate choice to adopt Ronin as our mainnet. Renowned for its specialization in gaming and its sizable user pool, onboarding on Ronin was ideal. Moreover, Ronin’s deep understanding of Blockchain users and its established presence in the Southeast Asia region ensured a seamless onboarding process for our target audience. By harnessing the synergy between the Ragnarok IP’s stronghold in Southeast Asia and Ronin’s expertise, resources, and user base, we positioned ourselves optimally to engage with our key demographic.To captivate and retain users, our game needed to strike a delicate balance: it had to be approachable yet challenging, embodying the ethos of “easy to learn, hard to master.” Embracing this mantra, we set out to create an experience that would appeal to a broad audience while offering depth and longevity.Drawing inspiration from the tower defense and RTS genres, we crafted a gameplay experience designed to engage both casual players and seasoned strategists. Tower defense games, known for their accessible mechanics, provided a solid foundation. However, we infused our game with unique elements to elevate the experience, ensuring it remained fresh and captivating.At its core, our game tasks players with assembling teams of Ragnarok monsters — Ragmons to defend their towers while launching assaults on enemy strongholds. Yet, we introduced innovative twists, such as the ability for players’ characters to join the fray alongside their Ragmon companions. These additions add layers of strategy, inviting players to think critically and adapt their tactics. Additionally, each season brings new challenges, with the stats of each monster undergoing adjustments. This dynamic environment encourages players to continuously refine their strategies, ensuring that mastery is an ongoing journey rather than a destination.In the PvP battle mode, players must contend with ever-changing opponents, requiring adaptability and strategic foresight. Assembling a diverse team of Ragmons becomes crucial, as each adversary demands a tailored approach. This strategic depth not only enhances gameplay but also fuels players’ desire to collect and cultivate their roster of Ragmons, aligning perfectly with the principles of NFT gaming.Furthermore, we are committed to expanding the game’s content with diverse modes such as guild battles and raids, drawing upon the foundations of tower defense and RTS gameplay. These additions promise a wealth of new experiences for players to explore, ensuring that each season brings fresh challenges and opportunities for engagement.Looking Ahead: A Future of Boundless PossibilitiesAs we embark on this transformative journey, our commitment remains unwavering. We strive not only to create a game but to cultivate a thriving ecosystem where innovation knows no bounds. With each step forward, we inch closer to our vision of a barrier-free gaming utopia, where gamers and investors unite in a shared pursuit of adventure and reward.In closing, we invite you to join us on this extraordinary voyage.

This is Episode 3, following up on Episode 1 — How it started and Episode 2— Meet the Zokus. The topic of the day: how to lose all of your hair in the span of 2 months, also known as how to render a 2D image of a 3D Zoku in real time.As a starter, if you haven’t already, you should take 5 minutes to read the extremely well-done Guide to ChainZoku, which will cover the basics of the project.To make this article a bit more interesting, I’ve decided to interview myself using the questions we asked ourselves throughout the development process, and the answers we found.I’m probably not teaching you anything by saying that for an NFT to be considered as such (and visible on Marketplaces), it must be represented by a single image (PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF). On top of that, it can also contain additional media in any format (video, HTML, image, text, etc.).With Zokus being customizable and evolving NFTs, a major challenge for us has been to find a way to generate a 2D image of each Zoku image as quickly as possible, whenever the user decides to add or remove a piece of gear.At Miinded, we’re no strangers to real-time 2D image generation. We’ve been experimenting with it for several years on our Cryptofoxes project.But we like to push the cursors to the max.Nope! In the case of a 2D customization project, we use a stack of PNG images representing the various traits of the NFT. The images are added one on top of the other in a very precise order to create a complete image.In 3D, this is not optimal! Because with the same process, there would be problems with shadows, highlights, superimposed elements and overall ugly rendering.To make a 2D image, it’s “easy”: you open Paint, make 2–3 doodles, save as a PNG and you’ve got something, ugly of course, but you’ve got something.In 3D, you don’t open Paint, you open Blender, Cinema 4D, 3DsMax, Maya and so on. These are all software programs with their own structures and varying degrees of functionality, and they’re very complex to get to grips with, even when it comes to making ugly things.The ChainZoku team has an excellent — I’d even go as far as say one of the best 3D designers around. He works in multiple different softwares, such as Zbrush (sculpting), Substance Painter (texturing), Marvelous Designer (clothing simulation), and uses Blender to put everything together to create the final render.Perfect, Blender has a Python API that allows all those developers who want to lose their hair to drive the software with code. LFG!!Not at all, each Zoku corresponds to a succession of Assets (cf: episode 2 — The Zokus). So to create our Zoku, we need to create each Asset independently, in 3D.It’s like 2D, but instead of having a stack of PNGs, we have a stack of 3D Assets. When you put it like that, it sounds so simple… But guess what? It absolutely isn’t.A 3D Object is 1 structure (Mesh), 3 images (1 texture, 1 normal map, 1 albedo), and the “stuff” that connects it all together.The 3D Object is stored in a Blender file that can only be read by Blender software.Each 3D Object must be placed in a 3-dimensional space represented by the X (horizontal), Y (vertical) and Z (depth) axes. Placement must be very precise, as the slightest deviation would be obvious. But we have a very large number of 3D objects to manage, all with very different placements. On top of that, we have to communicate with the 3D Artist to know every position of every 3D object… There’s too great a risk of error in the long run.We’ve opted for a simpler approach: everything in the same Blender file! That way, the 3D Artist places the 3D Objects exactly where he wants, and we just have to read the positions. Simple enough, right?Yet again, every simple solution has its limits: Blender file size.ChainZoku at launch (it has kept growing ever since) has over 400 meshes and more than 1000 textures, representing 65GB of raw data. We have good PCs, but not yet at the level of NASA.We had to divide the 3D Objects into different Blender files to reduce the weight of the Blender file while maintaining the correct positions of the 3D Objects.By the time of launch, we had 7 Blender files of around 10 GB each, which is heavy but still manageable.We created new ones post-launch in order to accommodate for new items being added.Now that we’ve got our 3D Objects well positioned in our Blender files, we can create the 2D image matching our magnificent Zoku.To achieve this, we’ve created another blank Blender file containing only the pre-configured lights, imported the 3D Objects corresponding to the Zoku Assets one by one, and rendered the image via a Python script executed by Blender.It’s as if a human launched Blender, imported the 3D Objects manually and clicked on “Render”, but here it’s done via code automatically.We do this 2 times per Zoku, once for the main image, and a second time for the Portrait image.The 2 images are then uploaded to our servers, compressed, cached in our CDN and finally made publicly available.The whole process from rendering to upload takes about 1min, a respectable score.Originally, we wanted to have rendering times of less than 10 seconds — which is technically possible to reach, but given the cost of render farms and servers, we decided not to.Currently, rendering is done by a server specialized in 3D rendering. It has a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3070) hosted in a datacenter in Paris. We developed a bespoke code and server interface in order to keep costs as low as possible. As of today, the server has already done 5,035 customizations — on top of having rendered every single original Zoku.I’ll go into more detail on how our render farm works in a future article — it took us weeks or R\u0026D!You may think that all this sounds easy and logical, but to get to this point, there have been many meetings, tests and accelerated hair loss…In the next article, I’ll tell you about OpenSea’s real-time 3D viewer, which was a big thorn in my side tooSee you in the next one!EKCO-Every simple solution has its limits-About MiindedMiinded is a French-based multi-disciplinary web3 studio founded in 2021.

By utilizing a game-theoretic model known as pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, PoSP encourages all participants to act honestly, enhancing the network’s overall trustworthiness and reliability. This protocol is not just theoretical — it has practical applications ranging from decentralized AI inference to improving blockchain layer 2 solutions, and extending further to enhancing the design of Actively Validated Services (AVS) in EigenLayer, making it a significant advancement in blockchain technology.Have you ever wondered how public transport authorities ensure everyone pays their fare, even though ticket inspectors seem to appear so infrequently? Consider the Swiss bus system, where instead of checking every passenger’s ticket on every trip, inspectors conduct random checks. This might raise a question: wouldn’t people take chances if inspections are rare? Interestingly, the answer is no. Here’s why: the random nature of inspections, coupled with the fines for fare evasion, sets up a scenario where the most rational, or optimal, strategy for each passenger is simply to buy a ticket.Let’s delve into the numbers for a moment. In Zurich, for a local zone trip, the price of a second class adult ticket for a half-hour validity is CHF 2.80. The penalty for being caught first time without a ticket is CHF 102.80. Suppose the probability of a ticket being checked on any given journey is 10%. Under these conditions, if a passenger decides to risk not buying a ticket, the expected cost (the penalty multiplied by the probability of getting caught) would be CHF 10.28 (10% of CHF 102.80), which is more than the ticket price. Therefore, economically and logically, buying a ticket is the most sensible option — the fines make evasion unattractive and compliance the best strategy.In a similar vein, the PoSP harnesses these principles within decentralized blockchain networks. Instead of verifying every single transaction or data interaction — which would be tremendously taxing on the system — PoSP uses a sampling method. Transactions are randomly selected and verified, drastically reducing the workload and computational demand. Here’s the clever part: the design of the protocol ensures that acting honestly is the most beneficial strategy for all participants, thanks to a game-theoretical concept called the pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. Under this equilibrium, any deviation towards dishonesty becomes less attractive compared to the rewards of maintaining integrity.So, how does this innovative approach reshape the security and efficiency of decentralized systems? As we dive deeper into the mechanics of PoSP, we’ll see how this protocol not only bolsters network integrity but also aligns seamlessly with the fundamental needs for scalability and efficiency in modern blockchain applications.In the ever-evolving world of decentralized system, imagine each node in the network as a participant in a high-stakes game show. Here, accuracy and honesty aren’t just valued; they’re required for the game to continue smoothly. Enter PoSP, a brilliant protocol that ensures every player adheres to the rules in a way that allows each participant to maximize their own utility, without the need for constant oversight from everyone else. It’s like having an invisible referee who occasionally steps in to make sure everything’s on track.Initial Move. The game begins with one node, known as the asserter, who claims to have computed a given function that helps maintain the ledger’s integrity. But instead of shouting out the solution for all to hear, they seal it in a metaphorical envelope — a cryptographic commitment. This envelope proves they’ve done their homework but keeps the actual answers hidden. It’s then sent off to the orchestrator, who holds the central role of overseeing the fairness of the game. In real application, the orchestrator could be a Layer 1 blockchain.Random Check. The orchestrator, equipped with a virtual coin, decides whether to trust the asserter outright or to verify the claim further. This decision is random but calculated, ensuring every play is fair but not overly burdensome. If luck is on the asserter’s side, they get rewarded right away for their efforts, and the game moves on.Initiate Challenges. If the coin flip goes the other way, the orchestrator calls in a select few from the network, known as validators. These validators are like detectives, each working independently to solve the same puzzle as the asserter. They, too, seal their answers in their unique envelopes, which are then collected for examination.Accept vs. Arbitration. As the orchestrator gathers these sealed answers, a moment of tension ensues. If all the envelopes match, it confirms that the puzzle was solved correctly by everyone, and the asserter, along with the validators, shares the reward. However, if there’s a mismatch, it triggers a detective-like review process where each solution is scrutinized. Honest nodes are rewarded for their accuracy, while any node that tries to cheat the system faces penalties.This approach leverages the collective power of the network to self-validate its computations efficiently. Under specific conditions, this PoSP achieves what is known in game theory as a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. It’s a state where all participants in the network are incentivized to act honestly because any other strategy would be less beneficial. In other words, when the system is set up correctly, with rewards and penalties balanced against the probability of being challenged, the most rational and profitable approach for all nodes is to compute the result accurately.","tags":["Decentralized Ai","AI","Blockchain","Web3"],"author":"Hyperbolic"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/marker/the-great-blockchain-of-being-ea604c56de8","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"What the origin story of the Reformation tells us about the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.","title":"The Great Blockchain of Being","detailed_content":"500 years ago the world was forever changed by a bad review.On October 31st, 1517, a plump, anxious friar and theology professor named Martin Luther nailed a list of complaints — his 95 theses — to the door of a monastery in Wittenburg. Luther was vicious, thorough, and attacked just about every aspect of Roman Catholic doctrine. He hated the new taxes anytime a new bishop was elected, the absurd yearly mass for the dead, the endless pilgrimages. But he saved special venom for indulgences.The indulgences were medieval pay-to-play, a way for the naughty to offset their peccadillos with a payment to the church. Covet your neighbor’s wife? Eat too many eel pies on Easter Sunday? Give a bag of silver or gold to your local bishop and you too could still walk through those pearly gates. For Luther it was a step too far — a greedy, cynical ploy by the Church that implied humans could haggle with God. It was widely hated, and when someone finally had the gall — or stupidity — to complain about it, people listened. Including, of course, the authorities.In 1521, Luther was called by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to recant at a formal papal assembly, or “Diet,” in the city of Worms. Luther was a small-time friar, used to woolen frocks and mutton sausages, untrained in the pomp and majesty of the court. But though he may have looked modest, Luther had a powerful weapon on his side — popularity.In the four years since Wittenburg, Luther had been a content machine, publishing almost 25 books, pamphlets, and religious tracts. His words made him a folk hero, the voice of a new religious movement that dared to defy the Catholic church. He had taken the printing press and weaponized it. And the threat this new technology posed to the iron grip of the Church was immense.For almost a thousand years the Catholic Church had been the center of medieval religious, economic, and social life, a kind of supramanager of the feudal order. It maintained that order through a vast set of rituals — attending Latin mass, making a pilgrimage to the bones of a saint — that publicly affirmed the power of the Church. God lived — quite literally in the eucharist — in the social body.But since the 14th century, major changes had destabilized the feudal order and the legitimacy of the church. The first major blow came with the arrival of the Black Death in 1349. By killing off half the population of Europe, the plague increased the supply of free land and decreased the supply of laborers, giving them both freedom from — and bargaining power over — their feudal lords. Feudal lords’ power further diminished with the discovery of New World markets in the 15th century. Financing expeditions, processing raw materials, and managing credit systems all necessitated an increasingly sophisticated economic system that shifted power away from rural aristocratic lords towards a market economy run by a burgeoning, urban middle class. And then came the printing press.Invented in 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, the printing press was the key technology of the early modern era. During the middle ages, books were hand copied, slow to produce, and prohibitively expensive. Gutenberg’s invention made written material cheap and relatively quick to mass produce. Although literacy was still low, the ability to rapidly spread new ideas through space and time was massively destabilizing to the Church’s thousand-year monopoly on the truth. If the Bible was the Word of God, and I have a copy, then what are the priests for? The revolution was already there, in any banker, journeymen, or cobbler’s hands; all Luther did was articulate it.In this way, the printing press did more than increase access to information, but radically changed the way medieval people imagined the world. There was no need for incense, Hail Marys, or magic spells; God was an idea, whose will could be divined privately by decoding his Words in a book. There was no need for priests or bishops; God’s truth was right there, waiting to be read. The printing press manifested its own theology. The old medieval world — where Heaven and Earth were unified in the Great Chain of Being — was suddenly split into new, opposing spheres: Church and State, public and private, body and mind.By nailing up his 95 Theses, Luther was the first to fully publicize this revolutionary shift. And now, at the Diet of Worms, it was time to defend his ideas — and his life — before some of the most powerful men on the continent.At the assembly, Luther summed up this movement in two phrases: sola fide, sola scriptura — by faith and the Word alone. The Bible, not the Church, was the only source of truth and legitimacy. This made all the Church’s intermediaries — popes, priests, monks — redundant. Then Luther took it a step further. He claimed (correctly) that the Church’s most sacred rituals — the eucharist, infant baptism, the cult of the saints — were pure inventions, with no evidence in scripture. It was all a puppet show used to keep bishops fat off the toil of serfs. To Luther, salvation was a private affair between God and an individual; no matter how much they paid for an indulgence, only God could forgive sins. He asked the court to find anything in the Bible that could refute his claims, a passage that showed that God required them — the well-fed, silken robed papal authorities seated before him — or their rituals. It didn’t go over well.The Diet quickly came to a decision. Luther was excommunicated from the Church — canceled, you might say — and told he could safely return home. But it was obvious that Luther was a marked man. He was too popular, too outspoken to be allowed to freely roam — or publish — in Germany. Before long, Luther would be arrested, sentenced, and executed for heresy. Thankfully, a sympathetic patron, the Elector of Saxony, Prince Fredrick III, staged a mock kidnapping in the woods outside of Worms and brought Luther back to his castle in Wartburg. Luther, probably without even knowing it, was saved from his own martyrdom.For the next two decades, Luther lived the life of a comfortable Influencer — writing full time and growing fat on ale and gravy-soaked roasts. In 1534, he produced his crowning achievement, the first German translation of the Bible. Now, any Bohemian cobbler or journeyman had unfiltered access to the Word of God.Over the next century, the movement that Luther defined — Protestantism, after the Latin protestari, “to publicly testify” — quickly spread across Europe. And it was more than a religious movement; it was a fundamental restructuring of Western society where the individual would be the center of the State.What came next, so the story goes, was the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, modernity. This eventually culminated in the triumph of the secular, scientifically rational world we live in today. And it all started with Luther, a lone hero whose dogged pursuit of truth, and challenge of the status quo, changed the course of history. Or maybe with the printing press — that singular technology that broke the intellectual stranglehold of the Catholic Church and helped birth an individualized and abstracted subjectivity. Take your pick; or better yet, combine the two. Because the story of Luther and the printing press is being told everywhere — on the pages of Wired and The New York Times, on Reddit forums and from TikTok influencers, in Apple ads and tweets from billionaire-entrepreneurs.It’s the story of messianic, techno-solutionism, the belief that advances in science and technology are inherently progressive; that history is not a struggle of social, economic, or environmental forces, but the inevitable triumph of better and better ideas (discovered and then propagated by some charismatic genius). Luther’s story still holds such sway because it is the genesis of this myth, the symbolic moment we stole fire from the gods. Techno-solutionism has become so ingrained, so necessary as a part of our cultural mythos that to deny it — even when the invention is digital-junk being touted by hucksters looking to make a quick buck — is to challenge a worldview that is as fervently, and irrationally, believed in as the dogma of the medieval Church of Rome.Five hundred years from the Diet of Worms, we are told we are on the cusp of another revolution. One that promises to eliminate our dependence on the State once for all, to create a utopia where everyone is their own master. It’s a story where everyone is getting hilariously rich, where unicorns drive Lamborghinis (“lambos”) to the moon and an ex-Hollywood child actor creates a $100 billion dollar currency. A journey into the future where everything is transmuted into software — the State, money, art, your identity.Behold, the blockchain.2008 — the year of the global financial crisis — was a good year to start a religion.A decade of cheap credit and a lax regulatory environment had turned the American economy into one giant casino. When the bookie finally came knocking, and no one could pay, central banks like the Federal Reserve conjured trillions of dollars out of thin air, and then promptly gave it back to the same self-dealing, corrupt bankers who had engineered the scam. Most of the public was too shocked or confused to know better. “Quantitative easing,” “mortgage-backed derivatives” — these “solutions” were as arcane and incomprehensible as a medieval Latin mass. But the message was clear: Money was magic, and only we — the high priests of finance — know the spells.That year, a mysterious coder named Satoshi Nakamoto proposed an alternative: a digital currency built on a decentralized system that was anonymous, hack-proof, and inflation-proof. There would be no central bank — new coins would be “mined” by computers solving complex math problems and then added to a cryptographically secure chain of code. The currency would provide a way for anyone in the world to exchange value free of the oversight of their government. One year later, Nakamoto released the proof of concept — Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency.Unlike Luther, Satoshi’s theses weren’t nailed to a bank’s door, but published in a white paper on an obscure cryptography mailing list, disguised in jargon and mathematics that were only decipherable to the coder-Elect. Soon, a legion of digital apostles formed to follow in Satoshi’s footsteps, creating their own alternative currencies — or alt-coins — and get fabulously, stupidly rich off of them.In 2015, a teenager named Vitalik Buterin developed Ethereum, an open-source rival to Bitcoin. (He’s now worth $1.5 billion.) In 2017, Bitcoin’s price soared almost 10,000%, from $900 to $20,000. In 2018, the ex-Mighty Ducks star Pierce Brock co-founded Tether, a “stablecoin” with a $100 billion dollar market cap. It was alchemy, code became cash, Priuses transmuted into lambos. Prices were going to the moon, and no idea became too stupid to make a buck off.A banana company in Laos created Bannancoin, pegged to the price of one kilo of Lady Fingers. Then there’s Dentacoin, a dentistry token that at one point had a market value of $2 billion. Dogecoin, with a cute little icon of a Shibu Inu as its mascot, started out as a joke — a memecoin. But after tech prophet Elon Musk tweeted about it, its value skyrocketed. Its current market cap: $18 billion dollars. Clearly, the ability to create billions out of nothing was the sign of a new era. Tether’s other founder put it bluntly: “This is the first time in human history anyone other than kings or governments or gods can create their own money.” King Solomon was minting his own mines.But, for the true believers the real promise in Satoshi’s paper wasn’t godlike wealth but the blockchain, the system of decentralized, distributed ledgers that Bitcoin is built upon. To put it (not that) simply, the blockchain is a massively shared, simultaneously accessed spreadsheet visible to everyone, but alterable only when certain conditions are met. Blockchain would fulfill the original promise of the Internet, as a free and open system that would disperse power rather than centralize it.The current Internet is a distributed system, where information is stored on servers that are accessed through a central router. This centralization has a lot of benefits — it’s simple, stable, and resilient — but there’s one major catch. Anyone who has control over this system has an incredible amount of power. Malicious state or corporate actors can shut down key routers to silence protests, hide bad PR, or even cripple whole economies. The Internet, as it was originally designed, favors the accumulation of power. Which is one reason why four companies — Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon — completely dominate it.In contrast, the blockchain is a decentralized system, built on peer-to-peer connections. Control is diffused, independent of direct state or corporate control. In a global blockchain system there would be no central node to control, no server farm to take over, just a Great Blockchain of Being — billions of individuals connected through a web of code. To its true believers, blockchain could redefine property rights, legal systems, and the very idea of a State for the 21st century.Anything that is added to the blockchain stays there — a digital version of Moses’ golden tablets. Through the use of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, individuals could store virtual property or inscribe their own names on this tablet — own their digital identity and decide how it would be shared, reproduced, or monetized. NFTs could be used to create a new kind of property that would be legitimized by code, rather than state authority. When combined with smart contracts — basically self-executing algorithms — the possibilities are, to the crypto faithful at least, endless.Smart contracts are a way to enforce the terms of an agreement without a middleman. With one swoop, you could replace lawyers, notaries, and bureaucrats with software. Instead of agonizing wait times at the DMV, your Bitcoin linked account could automatically pay — and guarantee the legitimacy of — your yearly registration. But, in theory, you could program these smart contracts to do anything — to replace legal systems, citizenship, even the State. A few brave crypto pioneers have already plunged into the wilderness to try just that.In 2021, Wyoming approved the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) — blockchain-based entities in which members use crypto-tokens to vote on actions. That year, a group of investors banded together to purchase 100 acres of sagebrush steppe in central Wyoming. (Showing the creative power of consensus, they named it CityDAO.) In the spirit of liberty and freedom, citizenship is open to all. For .25 Ether — about $1000 — you can buy “basic” citizenship to CityDAO, which includes access to a Discord, voting rights, and the option to settle land (after the first “founding citizens,” of course). No word yet on when the next tier of citizenship will be released.To its boosters, CityDAO is proof that blockchain and crypto can transform the world. If a group of strangers can create a country in the middle of the Wyoming wasteland, then anything is possible! Puff that idea up to a global scale and you have the next stage of social evolution — Web 3.0 — a global blockchain-based state that gets rid of all the rigid authority, messy politicking, and gross inefficiency of a human-run government.As of 2022, CityDAO is still out there, building Eden in a sea of tumbleweeds. But that’s not to say it, and the entire cryptocurrency industry, hasn’t had its share of growing pains. In mid-January 2022 a hacker gained control of the CityDAO’s admin account and stole 26.67 ETH (about $95,000). The same week that CityDAO was duped, hackers stole $30 million from Crypto.com. In 2021 alone, over $21 billion was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s a pirate economy built by, and for, thieves.13 years after Satoshi’s paper the only thing that cryptocurrencies have proven useful for is money laundering, tax evasion, outright scams, and most importantly, financial speculation. You can’t buy a house, or even a pizza, with Bitcoin. (Or, why would you want to if the price could change by 10% in ten minutes?) Ultimately, cryptocurrencies are not currencies, but speculative assets: stocks that have no dividends, post no earnings, and are ultimately worth exactly zero dollars.And then there are the environmental costs, usually downplayed by crypto-boosters. Bitcoin mining alone uses 91 terawatt-hours of electricity yearly. That’s more electricity than Sweden, 91 times more energy than Google, and .5% of energy consumption worldwide. And that’s all without providing anything as delicious as a kottbullar, or as ergonomic as a Gursken.What Bitcoin shows is the widespread disbelief that technology can fail; that innovation and adoption (or usefulness) are two different things. Instead of the techno revolution promised in Satoshi’s white paper, we have a giant carbon-spewing, Ponzi-scheme whose main innovation is to promote the sound investment advice of “buy low, sell high”.Despite all the obvious economic, environmental, and social hazards involved with crypto, there’s got to be something to it. I mean, everyone is getting in on it — influencers, celebrities, probably your nephews. And why not? As long as the line keeps going up, we’re all going to get rich? And you want to be rich, don’t you?And what about the blockchain? Surely, given all the hype there’s bound to be something useful there? Who wouldn’t want a digital vending machine that sells titles, wills, or citizenship instead of Snickers bars, or be able to make a few cents from NFT-minted digital identity every time Facebook sells your info to marketers?Unfortunately, the same qualities that make blockchain appealing — its decentralization, security, immutability — also make it incredibly slow, wasteful, and devoid of any privacy or consumer protections. The fact is, anything that you can do on blockchain can be better done on a centralized server. As blockchain skeptics have attested, it’s a solution looking for a problem.But even if no one uses Shibu Inu coin, or gets their Excitable Slug NFT marketplace off the ground, it doesn’t mean that the impacts of these new speculative assets won’t be far-reaching. There is now $3 trillion dollars invested in cryptocurrency, tied, more than ever, with larger markets through publicly traded companies like Coinbase, ETFs, and soon even your 401k. And like the mortgage-back derivatives of the early 00’s, the more these totally unregulated, fraud-ridden assets infiltrate the financial system the more unstable it will become. What started as a critique of the financial crash, will probably soon repeat it.But, the push for a technology that (so far) obviously fails to deliver on any of its promises portends something deeper than just cheap populism. Crypto and blockchain are appealing to venture-capitalist vampires like Peter Thiel or McKinsey \u0026 Company because they are another step towards a digitized, financialized future where everything and everyone can be bought in the market. An anarcho-libertarians\u0027 utopia where there are no gods, no masters, only the Market. Sola coda, sola blockchain.This paradise is sold as the only means of escape from the increasingly dreary, hopeless future that most young people find themselves in. Would you rather retire early after betting it all on Shibu Inu coin or slave away for the foreseeable future as an Instacart serf? And like most utopian projects — whose eminence is always just around the corner — faith fills in the meantime. It doesn’t matter what blockchain can do, but what you believe it will do. It doesn’t matter that most cryptocurrencies are clearly scams, only that they will — as long as that line goes up — free you from your shitty job.What the rise of crypto really shows is the failure of any social or political movements to provide a meaningful answer to the post-2008 financial crisis. Instead of instituting new democratic controls on the market, we turned our rage at the financial system into a speculative commodity. If that’s not what makes America great, what does?What this desperate need for social mobility at any cost fuels is techno-fetishism pumped to new religious heights. Because the technologies are so clearly useless, all we’re left with is the empty, irrational belief that messianic geniuses and magical technologies can save us from our political, social, and environmental ills. (And get us all rich doing so, of course.) And this belief is backed by the same basic myth of the printing press, rewritten to the digital age: where new technologies, and the social changes they produce, are seen as teleological. Basically, God’s will.Unfortunately, the origin story of the printing press — the Ur-myth about the socially transformative power of technology— falls apart after a cursory glance at its history.The first use of moveable type technology — the basis for the printing press — was invented 150 years before Gutenberg by a Korean minister named Choe Yun-In. Although Yun-In’s press produced a few religious works, it ultimately failed to have any immediate, long-term impact in East Asia. Even in Europe, the adoption of printing technology was fairly slow. For the first hundred years after Gutenberg’s invention in 1450, books were still mainly a hobby for the upper classes, a luxury item used to gain prestige, a way to continue the scholarly religious debates of the middle ages, or even used as loan collateral.In short, technologies are always a product of, and used within, a social order. The printing press was not some overnight revelation, but was slowly adopted and expanded over a period of hundreds of years. What accelerated its expansion in the early 16th century were changing social, economic, and environmental conditions. Luther’s 95 Theses spread so quickly because they landed in the fertile ground of medieval Catholic Europe. A thousand-year order was being undermined by the growth of market-based economies, rising competition between proto-Capitalist states, and the failure of a feudal agricultural system to deal with the colder climate of the Little Ice Age. But the Reformation didn’t happen overnight. Luther’s ideas had been building for centuries before they finally reached a critical mass. It was then through the spread of the written word that they metastasized — and eventually helped destroy — the feudal order.In contrast, the fact that crypto and blockchain has exploded so rapidly onto the market shows that this isn’t a real social or technological movement, but a religious one.What we’re witnessing is a grift disguised as a revival. At the forefront are pump-and-dump preachers hawking junk technologies whose rapid, zealous adoption only shows their speculative superficiality. What they created with cryptocurrencies is a new casino for desperate people to gamble their savings away as a way to escape the misery of their own lives. And it doesn’t matter how much money is lost, stolen, or scammed, as long as the fantasy is maintained: a techno-heaven where nobody works and everybody gets rich. And who wouldn’t want to step through those pearly gates? All you have to do is roll the dice, and pray.","tags":[],"author":"Chad Oelke","creation_date":"2022-02-08"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/berachain-foundation/the-bera-era-has-begun-49a18c6d77c0","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Tweet","summary":"The happy day has arrived.

Rejoice, one and all, because if you’re reading this, Berachain Public Testnet “Artio” is live.At long last, we’re excited to reveal Berachain to the world.First and foremost, the question that’s been on everyone’s mind for months:Since our inception in 2022, people haven’t known exactly what we do or what the chain is, or why they should care (our fault and kind of by design). So without further ado, let’s get into it.Berachain is an EVM equivalent L1 built on top of the Cosmos SDK, using Proof of Liquidity (PoL) Consensus, a variant of delegated Proof of Stake.What is Proof of Liquidity? In short, proof of liquidity is a sybil resistance mechanism meant to harmonize staking and align incentives between security and liquidity. This stands contrary to typical proof of stake chains where users possessing a fixed amount of capital have to choose between contributing to security by staking with a validator, or contributing to on-chain liquidity by providing liquidity in a DEX or lending platform.In Proof of Liquidity, the only way to contribute towards network security is by first doing the “work” of providing liquidity to a set of DeFi primitives that are built into the chain itself; namely a native AMM DEX, a perps exchange, and a stablecoin lending platform.The only way to earn BGT, the staking token of the chain which contributes to security, is by providing liquidity to the system. BGT is naturally illiquid and soulbound, and cannot be market bought, only earned.Validators and governance play a large role within PoL, and effectively control the “rewards rate” for different methods of earning BGT across the chain. Block by block, the validators direct the inflation back into the Berachain ecosystem across multiple primitives, keeping the network liquid. However, this can extend to any governance-approved smart contract on the chain over time.Each validator can set its own set of incentives and distribution of the BGT rewards it receives across a wide variety of governance-approved protocols. The weighted average of all of these distributions across the ~100 validators in the network will determine the APYs of each pool. The best mental model for this is Curve / Frax gauges, except in this case instead of veFXS/veCRV, it is the average weighting and distribution of BGT across the validator set which determines network wide rewards rates.Users delegating BGT will earn fees in the form of $HONEY, the native stablecoin of the network from the various protocols that are part of (or become part of) Proof of Liquidity, along with bribes from the validator that they are delegated to (more on this later).Finally, users can redeem or burn 1 BGT into 1 BERA at any point in time. However, this is a one-way process. Once the BGT is burned, it is gone for good. This gives them a choice between holding the liquid gas token, or holding a token which allows them to earn fees in the form of a stablecoin + bribes + influence the distribution of rewards across the ecosystem, while accruing fees from applications powered by BGT emissions.So in short, Berachain is fully EVM compatible L1 where users provide liquidity into the chain-enshrined primitives (dex, perps, stable lend, or others voted in by governance) to earn BGT, delegate it with validators to earn fees / bribes, or burn it into Bera. Through their contribution to liquidity on the chain, users bootstrap its security.Why should developers or protocols care?Berachain is the first chain with mechanics structured to sustainably enable protocols to build their liquidity base and drive capital efficiency over time.Protocols who successfully pass a governance vote will have their smart contracts included in the set of contracts whose LPs will receive BGT rewards (in the same way as the dex / perps / lend LPs receive rewards at genesis). This means that a new NFT AMM, on-chain game, SoFi protocol, or any other DApp requiring that extra helping hand in bootstrapping their protocol could launch on Berachain and effectively subsidize their cost of user acquisition by passing a governance vote for their vault / LP contract to receive BGT rewards, thereby giving their LPs emissions in the form of the staking/gas token of an L1 blockchain (in addition to any native token emissions).In short, protocols are able to attract more liquidity at lower costs. The chain is aligned, as it attracts the best protocols to build on top of it which serve as user acquisition channels. PoL allows protocols building on the chain to become “enshrined” into the base layer and contribute to security (BGT generation) via their users’ liquidity provisioning without modifying user behaviour.Typically, in bootstrapping liquidity, a protocol will launch a liquidity mining program, in which they pair their own native token against another token, and require users to stake this LP in exchange for emissions in the form of their native token, generally inflating or devaluing their native token. On Berachain, a protocol may work directly with validator(s) to bribe for liquidity in the native dex in the following process:Why should users care?Berachain’s private testnet and months of buildup have provided us with a thriving ecosystem. We strongly believe that an ecosystem can get off the ground quickly with effective planning. The basic primitives are built into the chain, discouraging a series of repetitive forks which are normally the short-lived basis of new chain launches. This will be bolstered by the 30+ native protocols and 100+ groups building from other chains which will be deploying on Berachain.Users can have their stake and eat it too — users who LP will earn BGT emissions, contributing to security, and be able to stake those BGT emissions to help influence the direction of liquidity across the chain, while earning bribes and fees from the network. This means that a user can tangibly impact their own economic incentives by participating in network, at no cost to themselves (eg. A user farming a stable pool LP in the DEX may choose to stake their BGT with a validator directing the majority of their BGT emissions to that stable pool, thereby increasing the user’s effective rewards or earnings on their existing LP)New game theory always brings out new ways to win in an ecosystem; the tradeoffs between BGT and Bera at different points in an economic cycle will give users an entirely new way to play — is it better to stake BGT and earn more network fees when not much is staked? Which validators will have the best bribes? Will they even reap the rewards of that new liquidity if they accept the bribe?At times this is a meme, but Berachain has a real community. There are thousands of NFT holders who have already bought into the ecosystem, and multiple projects that have formed their own communities even prior to the launch of this testnet with thousands of engaged users — see Infrared, Kodiak, The Honey Jar, Berachein, Ramen Finance, Beradrome, Beramarket, Goldilocks and more. There are podcasts, community rating services, public goods and a raving group of crypto-natives who are often the earliest users of new and exciting protocols across the space. They’ve been waiting for over a year, and they’re ready to go.Why should validators care?Validators are first class citizens in Berachain, controlling economic incentives and reward rates across the ecosystem; an unprecedented role and set of responsibilities for validators across crypto.There’s an opportunity to attract new capital and engage in a new form of governance. For Cosmos validators, they can now attract delegates and liquidity from the EVM world, which has typically been a major restriction for growth in the Cosmos ecosystem.This responsibility also brings new revenue streams to validators. Validators on Berachain may receive bribes or rewards from protocols building on the chain in exchange for directing BGT block rewards towards their pools or smart contracts. This allows a validator to diversify their treasury / holdings, receiving exposure to new protocols on the chain at no cost to their own users and delegates.Why should blockchain purists care?We talk a lot about how the blockchain trilemma has become a bit of a meme; decentralization turning into a form of regulatary arbitrage, scalability never reaching par with offchain/web2 options, and security being ignored until proven otherwise. The ideal chain probably maxes out on all of these properties, but a more practical trilemma perhaps revolves around users, developers, and capital/liquidity. With that somewhat counterintuitive point, Berachain actually makes meaningful strides in improving 2/3 of these angles, with the last one to be tackled in the future.Beyond all else, Berachain is its community — it’s a product of long nights on VC in Discord, CoD games with Dev, rap nights, MC sessions with FW, Honey Jar ceremonies with Jani and the guys, the Honeylist, fudding ourselves, podcast eps, raiding Polaris tech talks, meetups at conferences across the world, typing Bm in Discord, and everything in between.We’ve spent the last year building out our moneyball team of 30+ Beras — from folks who have built the very first Dapps on Ethereum to engineering and ecosystem leaders at Sui, Polygon, Mantle, Coinbase, Chainlink, Aave, Dapper, TFL and more, with collective experience in building applications reaching millions of users, securing $Bs of TVL, and deploying $Bs in capital.We’re incredibly thankful for the faith that you’ve placed in us, and our team is equally excited to see what everyone builds over the months to come as we move towards our mainnet later this year.Let’s see what happens when the liquidity is unchained.To learn more, check out Berachain’s foundation page and socials below.🌐 Website: https://www.berachain.com\n🐦 Twitter: https://twitter.com/berachain\n👾 Discord: https://discord.gg/berachain","tags":["Cryptocurrency","Venture Capital","Bears","Defi","Blockchain"],"author":"Smokey the Bera","creation_date":"2024-01-11"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/x-ticket/x-ticket-xtc-progress-report-april-2024-c01b7a0c2890","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"This report provides an overview of the activities of the X-TICKET (XTC) project.","title":"X-TICKET(XTC) Progress Report (April. 2024)","detailed_content":"This report provides an overview of the activities of the X-TICKET (XTC) project.● Developing ‘X-PASS’, a performing arts marketplace● System development2.

While the Raydium frontend provides a user-friendly interface for swapping tokens, not all users interact with the platform through this interface. Developers, in particular, may need to build applications or server-side scripts that interact directly with the Raydium smart contracts to facilitate token swaps or leverage other Raydium features.In this article, we’ll provide a brief overview of the swap instructions in the Raydium smart contracts. Additionally, we’ll walk through a code example that demonstrates how to build a script for swapping tokens on the Raydium AMM using TypeScript.Prerequisites:The Raydium.io AMM program is implemented in native Rust. Its structure resembles a basic vanilla Rust program with additional Rust files for logging (log.rs), mathematical computations (math.rs), and cross-program invocations (invoker.rs).For this article, we will be focusing on the SwapBaseIn and SwapBaseOut instructions.The Raydium AMM program uses two instructions to exchange tokens; SwapBaseIn and SwapBaseOut. These two instructions accept similar accounts but differ in functionality. If the output token is the base token, we use the SwapBaseOut else we use the SwapBaseIn. These instructions can be found at swap-instruction. We aim to write a script to exchange SOL for USDC on Raydium using typescript.2. Create a tsconfig.json file and add the following;3. Create a package.json file and add the following;4. Install dependencies;\nnpm install5. Install ts-node;\nnpm install -g ts-node6. Create a src folder and add the main.ts file in the src folder.As described in the contract code, the swap instructions accept 18 accounts and two instruction data. To successfully invoke the instruction, we need to fetch these accounts using the AMM ID of the SOL-USDC pool.In the main.ts file, we’re going to be creating the function that gets the accounts needed to execute the swap instruction from the AMM ID. Populate the main.ts file with the code below;The function takes two arguments: the SOL-USDC pool address and a web3 connection object. It fetches and decodes the pool account data and the market account data associated with the provided pool address.The market authority is a Program Derived Address (PDA) owned by the OpenBook market program. It is derived using the pool’s market ID and the market vault signer nonce, which were generated when the pool was initially created.The hardcoded authority address is the Raydium v4 liquidity pool authority.To create the swap instruction, we need to calculate the expected amount of USDC/SOL we want to receive based on the set slippage. The following function is used to achieve that;The function uses the Liquidity class provided by the Raydium SDK to calculate the expected amount of tokens to receive. It accepts the pool keys, tokens to buy (USDC/SOL), amount of tokens to swap, and slippage tolerance.Next, we add the function to create the swap instruction. The function accepts a connection object, a token to buy, the amount of SOL/USDC to exchange, the slippage, and the key pair of the signer. Before creating the swap instruction, the function gets token accounts for the input and output tokens, respectively. If the token accounts do not exist for the key pair, it creates the accounts before making the swap instruction. To learn more about Solana token accounts, visit this link. Also in the case of SOL input/output, the function creates a wrapped SOL token account for the key pair.This is the final part of the script. In this section, we create a function to make swap instructions and submit a transaction to swap SOL for USDC and USDC for SOL. Add the following code to the main.ts file:To execute this function, we must generate a Solana keypair in the project directory and load it with 0.01 SOL. Run the following code in the project terminal to generate the key pair:You can install solana-cli tools using this link.To exchange 0.01 SOL for USDC, add the following code to the main.ts file and run npm run swap;On successful transaction execution, the terminal should display the following output:This transaction can be viewed on Solscan using this link.To exchange USDC back into SOL, replace the USDC address in the earlier call with the WSOL mint address as follows and run the script again:In this article, we’ve had a brief description of the Raydium AMM program, swap instructions, and how to invoke these instructions to exchange tokens using Typescript. The full script for this article can be found in this GitHub gist.

Let’s embark on a detailed exploration of the Ouroboros journey, unraveling its origins, distinctive attributes, and progressive iterations.Derived from the ancient symbol of a serpent devouring its own tail, Ouroboros represents perpetual renewal and cyclicality. Within Cardano, Ouroboros embodies the concept of a blockchain’s enduring existence. The protocol integrates cutting-edge technology and rigorously vetted processes, ensuring the resilience and longevity of blockchain networks that adopt it.Ouroboros stands out through its utilization of advanced technology and methodically validated mechanisms, drawing insights from behavioral psychology and economic philosophy. It implements a “Nakamoto-style consensus” based on proof-of-stake, delivering robustness akin to Bitcoin while notably enhancing energy efficiency, transaction speed, decentralization, and equitable reward distribution.Ensuring fair and secure slot leader selection requires randomness. Ouroboros protocol, particularly Ouroboros Praos and Ouroboros Genesis, incorporates a feature called Global Random Oracle that produces unique randomness in each cycle. This is achieved using a Verifiable Random Function, storing a random value in each produced block, with the blockchain itself as the source of new randomness.Ouroboros incentive mechanism considers key scenarios: stake pools can only mint blocks if they represent a certain threshold of stakeholders, preventing fragmentation attacks, and rewards become constant for pools with high aggregate stake, discouraging centralization. That’s how it emerges as the leading Proof of Stake technology, exclusively implemented in the Cardano blockchain.Meanwhile, the widely-discussed Ouroboros Leios upgrade aims to enhance transaction efficiency and scalability. By leveraging its consensus mechanism, Cardano anticipates bolstering its transaction processing capabilities while maintaining decentralization principles intact.The Ouroboros journey unfolds through several iterative phases, each introducing novel features and enhancements to bolster security, decentralization, and efficiency.Ouroboros Classic (2017)Energy-Efficient Proof-of-Stake: Ouroboros Classic pioneered an energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus protocol in 2017, significantly reducing the ecological footprint compared to proof-of-work systems.Mathematical Framework: It laid the groundwork for a mathematical framework to analyze proof-of-stake protocols, enhancing understanding and confidence in the protocol’s security.Ouroboros BFT (May 2020)Transition to Decentralization: Deployed in May 2020, Ouroboros BFT facilitated Cardano’s transition to a more decentralized network, laying the groundwork for subsequent protocol advancements.Federated Node Consensus: It provided ledger consensus among federated nodes, ensuring network integrity and stability during the decentralization process.Ouroboros Praos (2020)Decentralized Block Production: Launched in 2020, Ouroboros Praos introduced decentralized block production, empowering stake pools and fostering network participation.Enhanced Security Features: Praos implemented robust security measures, including defense mechanisms against Sybil attacks and secure slot leader selection, fortifying the protocol against adversarial threats.Ouroboros Genesis (2022)Novel Chain Selection Rules: Ouroboros Genesis introduces innovative chain selection rules, optimizing blockchain bootstrapping and resilience.Efficient Network Bootstrap: It enables efficient blockchain bootstrapping directly from the Genesis Block, streamlining network initialization and enhancing scalability.Ouroboros CrypsinousPrivacy-Preserving Properties: While not planned for Cardano, Ouroboros Crypsinous introduces privacy-preserving features, expanding the protocol’s utility to applications requiring enhanced privacy and anonymity.Ouroboros ChronosHigh-Resilience Time Source: Ouroboros Chronos aims to bolster resilience in critical infrastructures by providing a high-resilience cryptographic time source based on blockchain technology, ensuring network synchronization and reliability.Ouroboros LeiosInput Endorsers and Optimization: Ouroboros Leios introduces input endorsers and optimization innovations to optimize consensus protocol throughput, catering to evolving network demands and increasing transaction efficiency.Recently, Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hoskinson has pointed out the two major upgrades coming to the blockchain. This includes the Chang Hard Fork and Ouroboros Leios consensus mechanism.Set for the second quarter of 2024, the Chang hard fork shall grant ADA holders voting rights on proposals, a significant step forward in Cardano’s decentralization journey. The upgrade’s objective is to empower the Cardano community with greater influence over the governance of the Cardano network.Aiming to democratize the governance of the network….READ A FULL ARTICLE ON CARDANO SPOT.","tags":["Crypto","Cardano","Cardano News Today","Blockchain","Cryptocurrency"],"author":"Cardano Spot"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@larissanetwork23/how-to-buy-lrsnode-key-using-larissa-android-wallet-a-step-by-step-guide-37d99ee575a5","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Are you ready to take your crypto journey to the next level and start earning passive income with LRSNode?

It’s not. There are MEV bots right now making millions of dollars per month in profits.However on the other hand there are many scammers that take advantage of this information and pretend to have such bots just to steal your money.This is not one of those scammer posts. I have years of experience working with MEV bots and today I’ll explain to you the 3 major types of MEV bots and how they work, so hopefully you have a better understanding of this exciting industry and maybe even build your own bots.There are 3 major types of MEV bots, those are:There are other specialized categories but those won’t be covered here. So how do those MEV bots work?To understand that, you have to understand how Ethereum works. In the Ethereum blockchain there is something called the mempool.When you send a transaction, say transfer 10 ether to your friend John, that transaction is not processed immediately. It is sent to the mempool, a place where all the transactions are sent.There, your transaction will be sorted and included in the next available block based on demand. The more demand, meaning the more people making transactions the more time it will take to include your transaction.The problem with the mempool is that everybody can see your transaction before it is confirmed and added to a block.Why is that important? It’s important because with MEV you’re able to send private transactions that protect you from the public mempool.They have a separate pool that is hidden where your transaction goes.Not only that, with tools like Flashbots you’re able to take someone else\u0027s transaction from the public mempool and put your own transaction before or right after theirs. This is key for MEV bots.I know it sounds confusing but it will make sense later on.So let’s start with understanding how Arbitrage MEV bots work:These are the most popular type of MEV bots. The way arbitrage bots make money is by buying a token in an exchange like Uniswap and selling at another like Sushiswap where there’s a price difference while you keep some.Let me repeat that, you buy a token at one place cheap and you sell it for a profit at another exchange where that same token is worth more.That’s pretty much how arbitrage bots work. You can repeat the process with more complex strategies where you buy other tokens, where you buy at once place, sell it at another for an intermediary token and then sell the intermediary token for ether.The complexities of arbitrage bots are unlimited. I’ve seen arbitrage bots buying tokens with ether, then buy an intermediary token for tether and selling those tether for the initial token that is then sold for ether.In other words, you can create complex strategies to take advantage of opportunities that aren’t taken by other bots.Arbitrage bots are essential in trading. They make sure the price of tokens are the same at every exchange and are rewarded for doing so.Let’s now see how sandwich bots work (my favorite type of MEV bots):Sandwich bots are the ones that buy before someone else and sell right after that person.To understand sandwich bot you need to understand 2 concepts:Slippage is a hard concept to understand, so make sure to re-read this section. If you go to uniswap right now and select a token to buy, you’ll be able to setup the maximum slippage.It usually is 0.1% or 1%. What does that mean?Slippage is another way of saying “I’m willing to accept 1% less than the initial price I set”Say you want to buy 100 $MEVDAO tokens. During the time you send the transaction and until it is confirmed, many other people may buy the token.Ethereum is interacted by millions of people everyday. Whenever someone buys the token $MEVDAO, the price is moved so instead of getting 100 tokens for 1 ether, you now get 90 tokens for 1 ether.The token got more expensive because the demand increased, the supply was reduced the moment someone bought it.So when you send a transaction and until it is confirmed other people will buy that same token you want. Why is this a problem?Because now instead of receiving 100 tokens for 1 ether you get 90 tokens for 1 ether before your transaction is confirmed. That is a slippage of 10%.So if your settings allow a slippage of 10%, then your transaction will be executed correctly, but if you allow a slippage of 5% your transaction will not be executed, it will be rejected because you don’t want a worse price.Why is slippage important then?Because sandwich bots take advantage of this important concept. Sandwich bots are able to see what swaps people want to make by reading the mempool.Then a sandwich bot calculates how much the bot has to buy to move the price so that John gets exactly the slippage or the minimum amount out.So if John wants 100 tokens but has a slippage of 5%, then he’s okay with receiving 95 tokens.Sandwich bots are so smart that they know exactly how much to buy of that token so that John gets exactly 95 tokens.The process goes like this:As you can see, after the bot buys and after John buys the sandwich bot sells those tokens.The bot doesn’t want those tokens, the bot wants Ether. So he’s swapping back those tokens for Ether while keeping the difference in profit.Where does the profit come from?It comes from the fact that John’s purchase made those tokens more expensive, meaning you get more ether for the same tokens. That’s where the profit comes from.How is this possible?All of this is possible because there’s a nice tool called MEV bundles.MEV bundles are simply ordered, private transactions.It’s a way of taking a public transaction from the mempool and put your transaction before or after it. You can put as many transaction as you want before or after.So they allow sandwich bots to buy before John, then allow John to buy and then sell those tokens for a profit.I know that was a lot. There are many new concepts you may not be familiar with, you probably have a million more questions about.In any case, join my community at https://t.me/mevdao so we can help you join this exciting world of MEV.With that said, let’s continue with the last type of MEV bot:With the creation of lending platforms like aave finance and compound finance, a new way of making money became possible.You see, those platforms are fully decentralized. People can take loans, lend money and repay loans without anybody’s permission.There are many elements that make this possible. One of those elements that make decentralized lending possible is the use of collateral.A collateral is just some money put aside that serves as a guarantee for a loan. When you borrow say 1000 USDT, you have to provide about 2000 dollars worth of Ether as collateral.Those 2000 dollars worth of ETH are locked away and kept safely while you use those 1000 USDT for whatever purpose you want.When you’re finished and ready to repay your loan, you give those 1000 USDT and get your 2000 ETH back.This system works very well however there is 1 issue with it, and that is…What happens if those 2000 dollars worth of ether drop in value?Imagine you lock away 1 ether worth 2000 dollars at the time you get your loan. Let’s say you spend 30 days to repay your loan. During that time ether drops in value from 2000 to just 800 dollars.Now your collateral is only worth 800 dollars because you locked away 1 ether. But you got a 1000 USDT loan. See the problem? You are getting more money than what you used as a guarantee.Before that happens, lending platforms will detect that and see “ether value is dropping, this loan for 1000 tether is at risk, we have to close it to protect our lenders”At that point liquidators come in. The loan becomes invalid because it’s risky and the platform doesn’t want to lose money.Liquidators simply execute a function that sells that 1 ether used as collateral and repays those 1000 tether to the loan providers while giving some of the collateral to the liquidator that executed the function.Liquidation MEV bots profit from closing loans.They look for expired or risky loans that can be closed for a profit and execute those functions.Liquidator MEV bots simply make money from closing bad loans.There are many lending protocols and those bots profit by helping protect their ecosystem from people that don’t repay their loans or from collateral drops.That’s about it! You now know how the major MEV bots work. Those bots are making almost billions of dollars per year (combined) in profit so the possibilities are endless.You can take a piece of that huge pie.

The core team behind it is the same as the Hubble Protocol.Marius Ciubotariu is the co-founder of Hubble and Project Lead of Kamino. With a degree in Business Economics, he worked in traditional finance (TradFi), as derivative product specialist and then as senior software engineer at Bloomberg LP, writing C++ and exploring Rust on the side as a hobby.Mark Hull is the core contributor of Kamino. He has a BSc in Business Administration and Management at the Manchester Metropolitan University. He,too, worked in TradFi in the service and project management at Credit Suisse for seven years and as Vice President at Swiss Re for eight years, before entering the crypto world as a contributor at Hubble Protocol.Currently (May 2024) no funds have been raised.Kamino Finance is addressing a variety of issues in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space on the Solana blockchain through its suite of products.These issues revolve primarily around the complexities and inefficiencies associated with liquidity management, leverage, and market speculation in a decentralized context.One of the primary challenges in the DeFi landscape is the complexity associated with managing liquidity. Liquidity is often fragmented even within the same protocol, leading to high slippage rates and less efficient markets. Traditional liquidity provision methods also expose providers to risks such as impermanent loss, where the value of deposited tokens changes compared to when they were deposited. This is particularly problematic in volatile markets.Additionally, managing liquidity positions requires constant monitoring and adjustment, which can be cumbersome and technically demanding. In traditional settings, liquidity providers (LPs) need to constantly monitor and adjust their positions to align with market conditions, often requiring sophisticated strategies to maximize returns and minimize risks.Another issue is the risk and complexity involved in leveraging investments in the DeFi space. Existing leverage options in DeFi can be complex and risky, often requiring users to engage with multiple protocols to achieve desired exposure. This increases transaction costs and operational risks, including the potential for liquidations in fast-moving markets.Moreover traditional DeFi platforms often utilize liquidity pools where capital is distributed across a wide range of prices, much of which may not be actively utilized. This setup leads to inefficiencies, as large amounts of capital are locked up without contributing to active trading, thereby reducing potential returns for liquidity providers.In environments with thin liquidity, trades of substantial size can significantly move prices, resulting in high slippage. This is especially problematic in volatile market conditions or for assets with lower trading volumes, deterring larger traders from participating.Furthermore many DeFi platforms specialize in either lending, trading, or liquidity provision, but few offer a seamless integration of these services. This fragmentation requires users to interact with multiple platforms, complicating the user experience and increasing transaction costs.Upon exploring the existing DeFi landscape, especially the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem, Marius recognized a gap in the market and a growth opportunity within Solana. Noting a lack of stablecoin options on Solana at the time, Marius decided to launch a project to create a stablecoin, which laid the groundwork for Hubble Protocol.The idea for Kamino developed from the need to support the DeFi ecosystem on Solana further, particularly around stablecoins and lending/borrowing frameworks. Kamino, aimed to build functionalities that would allow for capital efficiency and utility for stablecoins and other assets within the Solana network. This included creating optimized liquidity pools and lending markets that could support leveraged positions in a risk-aware manner.Kamino Finance is a DeFi protocol that seeks to amalgamate several financial functionalities (lending, liquidity provision and leveraged investment) within a single product suite.Initially, Kamino focused primarily on offering simplified solutions for liquidity providers to participate in yield-generating activities, especially through auto-compounding concentrated liquidity strategies. This approach is designed to optimize the process of earning returns from liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).As it evolved, Kamino expanded its services to include more complex features, currently (May 2024) such as:The integration of these services into a single protocol is intended to streamline user experience and potentially increase the efficiency of capital use within the DeFi ecosystem. Kamino places a significant emphasis on user experience, providing a platform that offers detailed analytics and performance data to help users manage and evaluate their investments more effectively.Kamino Lend (K-Lend) (Borrow/Lend section) system powers automated products like Multiply and Long/Short, and also functions as a standalone borrow/lend market.Traditionally, many lending platforms use multiple liquidity pools. Each pool is separate and holds different combinations of assets, with each pool having its own set of parameters and conditions. This setup can lead to fragmented liquidity, meaning that the money available to lend or borrow is spread thin across many pools, which can reduce the efficiency of the lending process.Kamino Lend’s approach is different. It uses a Unified Liquidity Market, which means it combines all the assets into a single pool. This centralization of resources has several benefits:This allows the Elevation Mode, an innovative feature within the Unified Liquidity Market for increased leverage while maintaining capital efficiency (introduced in Aave V3 as Efficiency Mode). This simplifies and enhances the borrowing experience:In the DeFi world, liquidity providers (LPs) play a crucial role by depositing their cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools. These pools are essential for enabling trading on decentralized exchanges without the need for traditional market makers. When you provide liquidity, you typically receive LP tokens that represent your share of the pool.Automated liquidity (Liquidity product) vaults were Kamino’s first product, launched in August 2022. Kamino liquidity vaults issue kTokens to depositors, which are yield-bearing LP tokens that are accepted as collateral in K-Lend.The growth of Uni V3 and concentrated liquidity as DeFi’s primary liquidity model has virtually stopped leveraged LPing in its tracks. This is because LP positions from CLMMs (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) are non-fungible, and cannot easily be used as collateral nor levered up.Kamino’s automated liquidity infrastructure tokenizes CLMM LP positions. These positions, called kTokens, are fungible, easily liquidatable SPL tokens.These kTokens form the basis of powerful DeFi strategies such as leveraged liquidity provision, or delta-neutral liquidity provision.When you deposit your LP tokens into Kamino Lend, called kTokens, these act as a proof of your deposit, much like a receipt, but they also continue to earn yield from the liquidity pool. This yield is auto-compounded, meaning it’s automatically reinvested to increase your earnings over time without any effort on your part.Kamino automates the entire LP process and optimizes capital efficiency \u0026 yields through:If you deposit into the mSOL-SOL vault on Kamino, you receive the kmSOL-SOL kToken and then deposit this kToken into Kamino Lend, to borrow SOL which can be redeposited into the mSOL-SOL vault, which means you mint more kmSOL-SOL tokens.As long as the liquidity vault yield remains higher than the borrow APY of SOL, your position earns positive Net APY.The innovation here is that kTokens can be used as collateral for borrowing other assets on the platform. This means you can unlock additional capital based on your initial investment without having to withdraw from the liquidity pool. Essentially, it allows liquidity providers to maintain their position and benefits in the pool, such as earning trading fees, while also being able to borrow funds for other uses.On K-Lend, you can opt to keep collateral assets from being borrowed by other users, thus protecting assets from any borrower default risks.Such assets, referred to as Protected Collateral, can still be used as collateral for borrowing by the depositor, but they do not earn interest on these assets. Protected collateral can be withdrawn at any time.Then the Multiply section is a one-click vault product that enables you to leverage your exposure to yield-bearing assets, by combining underlying K-Lend mechanisms like eMode and kToken collateral to offer powerful yield strategies.The core idea of Multiply is to enhance a user’s exposure to a chosen asset by using borrowed funds, thereby amplifying potential returns through leverage.Multiply operates by allowing users to open a leverage position against yield-bearing assets such as JitoSOL by borrowing SOL, the underlying asset. This process is facilitated by two primary features within the Kamino ecosystem: Elevation Mode (eMode) and flash loans. eMode enables users to achieve higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, which in practice means higher leverage.It basically uses the kToken lending strategy in a yield loop.(The risks associated with this method are primarily linked to liquidation scenarios. If the borrow rate exceeds the yield on the staked asset for a prolonged period, the increasing debt might reach a threshold that triggers liquidation)The project currently doesn’t have a defined roadmap (May 2024).Kamino has completed numerous external audits, currently (May 2024) 10 audits that can be reviewed on his GitHub.Continue the analysis by reading the Tokenomics on the App…Finish the analysis by reading the Conclusion on the App…Continue the analysis by discovering the FV Score on the App…Want to decide on the next crypto to be analyzed?

These products use models that can learn from data and generate something new, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard chatbots.Generative AI can create content of all kinds, but it can also raise questions about its origin and veracity. To solve this, tools such as cryptographic keys and blockchain technology can be applied, which allow the authenticity and identity of content and people to be verified.AI and Web3 can collaborate positively, as they can leverage shared management of data, especially data that is private and sensitive, such as medical records, as well as content verification and prevention of deep fakes, which are fakes created with generative AI.To prevent manipulation, cryptographic private keys and digital signatures can be used, which serve to ensure the origin and truth of the content.\nOther benefits could be privacy protection from AI models or the reliability of payments.AI and everything related to blockchain have enormous potential to change the future, but they also have to overcome challenges and difficulties to demonstrate their value and usefulness in solving real problems and meeting the needs of people and industries.Real World Assets Tokenization (RWA) are real-world assets that are converted into digital tokens using blockchain technology and smart contracts . These tokens can be fungible or non-fungible (NFT) and represent ownership rights to the assets.The tokenization of RWA has the potential to transform many sectors and markets, as it allows assets to be fractionated and traded more efficiently, securely and transparently . In turn, it opens up new investment opportunities and access to greater liquidity, especially for illiquid assets such as real estate, art or private capital itself.RWAs also have great relevance for the crypto space, since they can connect traditional finance assets with decentralized finance (DeFi) , offering financial products and services without intermediaries and with fewer costs, so investors and participants can access loans, liquidity pools or staking, using RWA tokens.This trend can bring many benefits, such as saving money by eliminating intermediaries, improving the accessibility and transparency of assets, solving the liquidity problem of traditional assets and mainly attracting a new audience that is more skeptical when it comes to using cryptocurrencies.Visit: Top 10 Real World Asset Tokenization Companies 2024GameFi or better known as Play-to-Earn games , will continue to be a trend this year.Web3 games combine gaming with finance and use blockchain technology to decentralize game servers and avoid censorship, unlike traditional games.The particularity of these games is that players can use digital objects to buy them, lend them and do other operations with blockchain.GameFi gives players complete freedom over the items they obtain and own, thanks to tokenization. The objects are converted into digital tokens that can be fungible or non-fungible (NFT).Although it has been a trend within the sector since 2020, the Gaming sector continues to grow year after year and GameFi makes the game accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill or knowledge of crypto.However, they have certain risks that must be investigated and taken precautions, since not all games are unreliable, so players themselves should choose games with solid users, development and economics, to enjoy GameFi safely.NFTs have gone from being a trend to becoming an important part of the crypto ecosystem . In 2024, NFTs are expected to not be limited to digital art, as in the past, but will extend to various representative industries such as fashion or music.The tokenization of unique experiences and the direct connection between creators and consumers will continue to increase , transforming the way we value and own digital assets and thus expanding brand identity and the power of communities within digital spaces.The different uses that NFTs can have in 2024 make the future of digital assets promising, such as the integration of NFTs into the Metaverse .Virtual worlds are growing at a considerable rate, and consequently NFTs are going to play a key role in shaping the digital environment, from virtual properties to assets in video games, thus generating experiences that encompass the virtual with the physical.Other examples would be dynamic NFTs, or tokenized ones with a more social nature or those already mentioned above created by AI, thus creating a much more alive ecosystem and at the same time providing unique experiences that undoubtedly help the generation and development of much more communities. committed and that there is much more direct participation in decision-making by users.Therefore we see the path to which the crypto and web3 world is heading, which is allowing the creation of new decentralized products and services , and how technology contributes with these trends to improve the security, privacy and responsibility of the actors. digital.If the world of Blockchain and Web3 interests you and you want to know more details about them, then you cannot miss our training pill on the basic concepts of these two disciplines carried out by our expert Diego Ferragud, CEO \u0026 Founder of Criptendo.","tags":["Blockchain","Blockchain Technology","Cryptocurrency","Web3","Real Estate"],"author":"BlockchainX","creation_date":"2024-03-13"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/coinmonks/top-5-crypto-to-buy-right-now-for-a-100x-return-a88d7b603a44","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Discover the top 5 cryptocurrencies to buy for a 100x return potential.

Diversifying your portfolio with these top 5 cryptocurrencies could position you for significant returns in the ever-evolving crypto market landscape.Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat currencies), cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. This technology allows transactions to be recorded in a secure and immutable manner across a distributed network of computers.One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is their decentralization, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity, such as a government or financial institution. This decentralization, coupled with the use of cryptography, ensures the security of transactions and the integrity of the cryptocurrency system.Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first decentralized cryptocurrency and remains the most widely known and traded. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created, each with its own unique features and use cases. Cryptocurrencies can be used for various purposes, including online purchases, investments, and remittances, and as a means of transferring value across borders quickly and efficiently.Cryptocurrency investing involves buying, holding, and trading digital assets with the expectation of generating profit. Investors typically analyze factors such as technology, team, market demand, and adoption potential before investing. Strategies range from long-term holding (HODLing) to active trading based on market trends and news.Risks include market volatility, regulatory changes, and security vulnerabilities. It’s essential to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and stay updated with market trends. While the potential for high returns exists, investing in cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks and requires a disciplined approach to manage them effectively.DarkLume (DLUME) is a cryptocurrency associated with a metaverse platform that promises a unique blend of gaming, social interaction, and even a virtual economy.

To elaborate, we always consider the community factor first when designing a game. Will this bring fun to the community? Will this benefit the community? Will this in any way affect the community?The term “community” does not merely refer to the mass of people playing the same game. It is a broader term that describes the connection between content (the game) and the surrounding ecosystem. The community is partly the ecosystem and partly the content itself.Sidekick is our initial approach to building the community. We aimed to raise awareness about the game, have people enjoy the draw and talk about their experiences, invite other communities to the world of Supervillains, and create opportunities for inter-project collaboration. In short, we introduced Sidekicks to the world to energize a vibrant community.In this article, we’d like to delve into more detail about Sidekicks. Some information is known, while other aspects are new ideas. We hope this text helps you understand our plans for Sidekicks and gets you excited about what’s to come!Sidekicks are creatures in the upcoming Supervillain Idle RPG that enhance the abilities of Villains. Together, the two form a strong bond and eventually evolve into Supervillains, characters with ultimate power.Sidekicks can be acquired both outside and inside the game.Out-of-game, in the web environment, Sidekicks are obtained through web-based gacha, as was the case in the Sidekick Draw.Another method to acquire a new Sidekick will be through Sidekick Fusion, which we will cover later in this article. Sidekicks obtained from the web can be easily utilized in the game by using the Supervillain Inventory.In-game, they will appear during gameplay, and players will be able to capture them. These Sidekicks obtained in the game, however, are not tradable unless a special item is used to make them tradable. This measure is designed to prevent inflation in the Sidekick supply. More details on how this will work will be provided as the game approaches its launch.In the Supervillain Sidekick Draw, five different rarity grades could be found: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary.In the future, a sixth grade, Mythic, will be added. Mythic is a higher rarity than Legendary. Although still undisclosed, Mythic Sidekicks will only be obtainable by possessing Legendary Sidekicks. Details on how to obtain a Mythic Sidekick will be revealed soon, so please stay tuned!Legendary Sidekicks are exclusively available, meaning there is a limited supply.In-game, 1,000 Legendary Sidekicks will be distributed over 18 months. They cannot be purchased via in-app purchases (IAP) but will only be obtainable through gameplay.Out-of-game, in the web environment, there will also be 1,000 Legendary Sidekicks. They can be obtained either by gacha or Sidekick Fusion. (Please note that the number of total web Legendaries might exceed 1,000 in the unlikely event of two incidents occurring within a very short time span.)Additionally, more will be granted to top contributors to the game, such as rankers, creators, guild masters, etc. The method and numbers are yet to be disclosed, but please understand this as the direction we’d like to build our policies toward.Now let’s talk about Sidekick Fusion: Fusion is a way to get (the opportunity to get) a Sidekick of a higher grade, which includes Legendary.The scheme is as follows: You take 2 Sidekicks of the same rarity grade, fuse them together — and you get 1 new Sidekick of the same or higher grade. The 2 Sidekicks you used for the Fusion will be burnt.The higher the grades of the Fusion materials are, the more likely you are to get a Legendary Sidekick. Of course, if you are extremely lucky, you might be able to obtain a Legendary Sidekick by putting 2 Common Sidekicks together… Well, we hope for the best!Sidekick Fusion will be updated at https://supervlabs.io on May 29.The answer: On-Chain Randomness!Games are all about probabilities. Every action, like a character hitting a monster, is influenced by probabilities. From critical hits decided by chance to the random variability in basic damage and defense, randomness is a cornerstone of gameplay. Supervillain Labs aims to ensure all this happens with the robust transparency of blockchain transactions.Specifically, for the Sidekick Draw this time, we created a web dashboard where all draw attempts and their outcomes were recorded. The analysis of over 83,000 draws resulted in a 99% confidence interval for the Legendary drop rate. Anyone could verify the logic and draw results because we made use of the Aptos Roll, the on-chain randomness API developed by Aptos, the sources of which are open and accessible to anyone.Now that the event is over, the dashboard has a new look: Please take a look here if you’re interested!Here is our roadmap, which provides an overview of what’s happening at Supervillain Labs in the near future — and hopefully makes you feel excited about it!To be frank, we feel significant pressure once the assets we release gain real value on the market and people actually start to trade them. Planning is difficult, executing the plan is even more challenging. Without action, however, even the best plans are useless.We are carefully designing the Sidekick distribution: it is strategically planned to maintain asset value and adjust according to the increase in in-game users. While we will continue to be disruptive in presenting new models in web3 gaming, we promise to be careful in maintaining asset value, as it belongs to the community — not something we are allowed to deliberately touch or manipulate. But from the deepest bottom of our hearts, we sincerely hope that the games and content we provide bring true fun and value to you.Thank you so much for being part of our journey! See you again soon.","tags":[],"author":"Supervillain Labs","creation_date":"2024-05-01"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/api3/api3-launches-next-generation-oracle-stack-on-merlin-chain-e3ed78fc8a2a","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Developers on Merlin can now utilize dAPIs and OEV Network to power their applications.","title":"API3 Launches Next-Generation Oracle Stack on Merlin Chain","detailed_content":"We are excited to announce that API3’s Oracle Stack is available on Merlin Chain, giving developers access to decentralized data feeds (dAPIs) and the soon to be launched OEV Network to recapture protocol MEV due to oracle updates. Developers on Merlin Chain can now access decentralized data feeds powered by first-party oracle nodes, which are operated directly by the data providers.With the launch of OEV Network later this month, protocols using API3’s decentralized data feeds on Merlin Chain will have a vertically integrated solution for recapturing MEV. Rather than protocols leaking value to searchers and block builders, the proceeds from oracle update auctions are programmatically returned to the dApp where the value originated, leading to better execution for users and better protocol performance for dApps.Merlin Chain is a Bitcoin Layer 2 network that leverages the power of zk-technology to enhance the capabilities and functionalities of Bitcoin. Merlin Chain integrates a decentralized oracle network, data availability, and onchain BTC fraud proof modules to provide a secure and efficient network that simplifies Bitcoin adoption and fuels growth. With a core mission to “Make Bitcoin Fun Again,” Merlin Chain aims to expand the innovation from Bitcoin’s Layer 1 to its Layer 2 by supporting native assets, protocols, and products. The network utilizes zero-knowledge proofs, which are submitted to Bitcoin for verification, and enables challengers to present fraud proofs to leverage Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism for dispute resolution. This ensures the security and economic efficiency of the network, promoting a high growth ecosystem for users.The infrastructure of Merlin Chain is built on Polygon’s ZK-technology and is supplemented by Celestia’s decentralized oracle network for enhanced data availability. It also incorporates Lumoz’s decentralized computing power for zk-proof computations. Merlin Chain not only inherits the robust security of Bitcoin but also introduces significant scalability through batch processing at the Layer 2 level. As an EVM compatible L2, it supports the majority of existing smart contracts and developer tools, ensuring seamless interoperability across different platforms. Additionally, the use of zk-proofs, combined with zkSNARKs, minimizes space consumption on Layer 1, which significantly reduces transaction costs while achieving high performance through rapid network finality and scalable recursive STARK solutions.Developers looking to utilize dAPIs on Merlin Chain can visit the API3 Market. The API3 Market provides an easy way to browse, access, and manage a wide variety of data feeds, including crypto, forex, equities, and commodities. With the launch of OEV Network, developers will simply be able to read any data feed, enable OEV Network, and start earning.API3’s first-party oracle architecture maintains data onchain directly from the data providers. This decentralized and verifiable design eliminates rent-seeking middlemen and offers a more secure and efficient method for bringing data onchain.One of the key benefits of dAPIs is the ease of use for dApps and chains requiring oracle services. Rather than having to manage their own infrastructure, dApps can simply read data that is natively maintained on Merlin Chain. This solution makes it easy for dApps to quickly and easily migrate to Merlin Chain from other EVM-compatible chains, allowing for the rapid adoption and scaling of DeFi ecosystems.API3’s first-party oracle architecture leverages data directly from the source. The oracle nodes are operated by the data providers themselves, bringing cryptographically signed data onto the blockchain. This allows dAPIs to be verified down to the API parameters and aligns with core principles of the blockchain ethos of transparency and onchain verification.Protocols like Aave, Compound, and various DEXes all rely on data maintained directly on the consumer chain. API3 addresses this need by maintaining data on the native-chain in a verifiable and decentralized way. With the introduction of dAPIs on Merlin Chain, developers gain direct access to a wide assortment of real-world data, including crypto, forex, equities, and commodities straight from the source.DeFi protocols that rely on oracles leak a lot of MEV. For protocols like lending dApps, this amounts to millions of dollars a year.OEV Network creates an efficient market where oracle service providers and searchers come together to combat the negative impact of MEV through specialized order-flow auctions. With OEV Network, searchers don’t need to wait for the price to update onchain, they can trigger the price update when it is most valuable. As an application-specific solution, it captures all the MEV created at the protocol level due to oracle updates and gives it back to the dApp that generated the value.OEV Network gives every lending and borrowing protocol on Merlin Chain a built-in MEV solution by improving upon critical inefficiencies in the current oracle design space. By leveraging the security of a zk-rollup to create an efficient market for oracle updates, it not only improves the health of lending and borrowing dApps but also allows them to capture a multi-million dollar opportunity.API3’s oracle stack is easy to implement and offers a flexible, scalable solution for developers building on Merlin Chain. For those new to dAPIs, a developer Getting Started with dAPIs Video is available to guide you through the API3 Market.For more information about dAPIs or OEV Network, visit our website, follow us on Twitter, or explore the technical documentation.","tags":["Web3","Blockchain","Api3 Ecosystem","Oracle","Data"],"author":"API3"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@aarkdigital/1000x-trading-competition-win-from-320-000-prize-pool-31939676b1d9","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Mark your calendars for the ‘1000x Trading Competition’, which will begin on April 29th at 00:00 UTC.

He/SheThey/It combined different technologies and ideas like cryptography, game theory, economics, and algorithms to achieve this breakthrough.When Bitcoin first emerged, people didn’t refer to its underlying ledger technology as “blockchain.” Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation allowed Bitcoin users to directly exchange digital currency without needing a centralised authority, like a bank, or a building society, or a checking account to verify transactions. This marked a significant advancement that earlier digital transaction systems hadn’t accomplished.What is the difference between Bitcoin \u0026 Blockchain?Blockchain is like a digital ledger that records transactions or information. It’s shared among many people, and once something is recorded, it’s hard to change.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a type of digital currency that uses blockchain technology. It’s one of the many things you can do with blockchain, like how email is one thing you can do with the internet. So, while Bitcoin uses blockchain, blockchain itself can be used for lots of other things besides Bitcoin.A bit more about Blockchain and how it works:A blockchain is helpful when many people need to agree on information. It’s often used in places where people don’t trust each other.People interact with the blockchain using their computers (called nodes). They help verify transactions and add them to the ledger, which is like a digital record book. This agreement process is called “consensus,” and there are different ways it can happen.Public blockchains are transparent, meaning anyone in the network can see what’s written in the ledger. This openness allows people to verify transactions and see their order, making the blockchain both decentralised and transparent.What does the future hold for Blockchain tech?The future of blockchain holds immense potential for transforming various industries and aspects of our lives. Here are some possibilities:If you ever used decentralised technology, safeguarding your online presence is paramount. Always ensure you are using a VPN. A quick why:If you enjoy my writing, please tune in next time where I will cover digital security and the use of a VPN in more detail.Thanks for reading :)","tags":["Blockchain","Blockchain Technology","Cryptocurrency","Web3","Technology"],"author":"Web 3.0 Educational Insights"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-tech-update-series-april-2024-4fc2f54f168f","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"Welcome to the April tech update, VeFam!

Our fast-growing developer teams have been working tirelessly, building new and upgraded solutions for our ever-expanding platform in pursuit of our vision of a Web3-powered, tokenized and sustainable global economy.Looking ahead at Q2 of 2024, we’ve a packed tech roadmap, and, as always, lots to look forward to. VeChainThor, our battle-tested blockchain, continues building in preparation to onboard the inevitable tidal wave of real world blockchain adoption that lay ahead.On February 28th, we proudly launched a new ecosystem on VeChainThor — VeBetterDAO — a unique dApp and DAO platform that embodies the concept of ‘X-2-Earn’. At its core, activities logged on VeChain’s blockchain can be rewarded, incentivizing engagement with all kinds of sustainability-related decentralized applications, as well as platform governance.The launch of VeBetterDAO marks the culmination of a long evolutionary journey for VeChain, building on almost a decade of successes to launch a platform aimed at driving mass adoption across society, both for businesses and individuals. Upcoming regulations, most notably in Europe with MiCa and environmental regulations, present myriad opportunities for the future of our newest ecosystem.Ahead of mainnet launch, our teams are working on new dApp onboarding flows and enhanced ‘explore dApps’ UI. In parallel, Governance and Treasury mechanisms are being built, as are the quadratic voting and funding mechanisms that will ensure a fair and proportional voting environment for users.The Galaxy Membership (GM) program — our NFT-based user privilege/reward system — is being upgraded and the B3TR\u003c\u003eVOT3 swap UI design is being re-evaluated. These mechanisms, as well as others, are explained in the new VeBetterDAO Whitepaper, and expected by mainnet launch, targeting VeChainThor’s 6th anniversary.We’re excited to bring this game-changing platform to mainnet, and drive a new phase of Web3 adoption across the economy.A Beta of our white-label NFT marketplace platform (MaaS) recently launched, going live in collaboration with MotoGP world champions, Gresini Racing. Check it out, here!MaaS sees VeChain continue our pioneering approach to blockchain adoption, leveraging the no-code principle applied to VORJ. By removing the need for deployers to have Web3 developer experience, adoption becomes simple and seamless. Our devs teams are now busy integrating feedback to finalize various features ahead of its full public launch.MaaS features ‘social logins’, a method of wallet management that abstracts away seed phrases and private keys, instead offering users a more familiar ‘Web2’ experience, logging in and accessing assets through their username and password.MaaS will also support ‘phygitals’ (physical products with NFT/chip powered digital twins), helping VeChain accelerate the global tokenization movement. The MaaS team have onboarded an NFT checkout provider, and are in active discussions with a global payment service provider for direct fiat on/off ramps.We foresee a future where tokenization, NFTs and phygitals become a mainstay of commerce and community engagement. MaaS, VORJ and other VeChain-powered no-code tools are helping ‘take the blockchain out of blockchain’, creating a more seamless onboarding experience and accelerating the real world adoption of Web3.Our expanded core protocol team has issued a new update to Thor.Notably, the update increases the block gas limit from 30M to 40M, increasing default cache size to 4GB. From a user interface perspective we refactored our API from Swagger to Stoplight, improving usability and functionality. Alongside the aforementioned, the update is accompanied by various dependencies, code coverage and refactors.Upgrade your public nodes and Authority Masternodes to the latest version of Thor as soon as possible. See the release notes, here.The new X-Node Reward platform (found here) is considered functionally complete, with the team deploying the new X-Node marketplace, direct transfer functionality, upgrade functions as well as claim and historical claim overviews.The team is currently focused on delivering better performance and efficiency.We are in the process of releasing the third phase of our official website — with a launch target of May.We’re delivering a streamlined, optimal experience for users, whether enterprise, builder, or simply curious, making key resources readily accessible.We’ll announce its launch via our official Twitter/X account — stay tuned!We are working on upgrades to our Ledger Live application, further improving its quality and reliability.You can download VeChain’s Ledger Live application, here.Development on VeWorld, our home for all things VeChain, continues in earnest, with multiple streams of development underway, including updates to the VeWorld browser extension.VeWorld has a dedicated team constantly building, and providing support for users.

Trade on DeGate DEX now: https://app.degate.com/.Trading Volume and More Tokens!In April, DeGate’s monthly trading volume was $556 million, marking a 51% increase compared to last month. The all-time volume has now surpassed $1 billion.The number and variety of tokens available for trading continue to grow. As of this writing, there are 143 trading pairs, covering the most popular ones.Perhaps you’ve noticed that some tokens from non-EVM chains are also trading on DeGate. Have you seen, for example, $NEAR, $SOL, $WIF? Users have expressed a desire to also trade non-ERC-20 tokens, so we are working around the clock to bring them to DeGate. The first batch of these tokens was bridged to DeGate through Wormhole. We are continuously exploring solutions to bring in more assets, aiming to satisfy user needs as much as possible.Product UpdateGrid Strategy UpdateThe single-token investment feature for Grid Strategy is now live! Users can now invest using only one token, the quote token of the pair, to open a Grid Strategy. Previously, users needed to allocate two tokens to create a Grid Strategy, a process more akin to setting up a Uniswap LP. However, based on user feedback, we realized many of you prefer the ease and simplicity of creating a Grid Strategy with just one token. The Details section of a Grid Strategy has been adjusted accordingly, presenting essential data that help users quickly understand key performance indicators like Grid Profit and Total Profit.DisconnectA ‘Disconnect’ button has been added to the user interface. When a user closes the browser tab of the DeGate App, the sensitive information temporarily saved in the SessionStorage of the user’s local browser is cleared automatically. Generally, closing the browser tab equates to disconnecting the wallet. However, feedback indicated that users are accustomed to manually clicking ‘Disconnect Wallet’ when exiting a dApp, as it provides a confirmatory sense that their wallets are disconnected. To align DeGate more closely with user habits, we have added this feature.Podcast with Mountain ProtocolA new podcast featuring DeGate evangelist Alvin and the CEO of Mountain Protocol is now available on Taiwan’s top influencer Bonnie’s YouTube channel. In this episode, the guests delve into discussions about stablecoins, inflation, and the advantages of using USDM. Alvin highlighted the unique benefits of USDM on DeGate — its flexibility for trading while being rebased daily.As of today, DeGate remains the leading exchange for USDM trading.ConferencesToken 2049April featured the hottest crypto event of the year, Token 2049 in Dubai, an event DeGate could not miss.

These are special liquidity pools where Kensetsu XOR (a Kensetsu asset that will be pegged to XOR) will be able to act just like real XOR and be able to swap for assets. Why this matters will become apparent as more parts of the tokenomics are released in the coming weeks, but initially this will be enabled for the XOR-ETH liquidity pool on Polkaswap.Just as the initial KEN supply was determined by burning XOR for KEN, a burn-drop will be done for $KARMA tokens. This time the rate will be 100 million XOR burnt for 1 $KARMA, making it the ultimate status symbol. Just imagine the look on the ladies faces when you pull out your Fearless Wallet and show them that you have a the full girth of a $KARMA token sitting there. Burning more than 100 million XOR will get you proportionally more $KARMA tokens, but burning less than 100 million XOR will get you nothing! You have between blocks 15,739,737 and 16,056,666 to burn your XOR to count towards the $KARMA burn-drop.$KARMA is a farming reward token meant to incentivize liquidity for Chameleon pools on Polkaswap (initially XOR-ETH). For each Kensetsu XOR minted from collateralized deposited, 1% extra of the KXOR stablecoin will be minted and used to buy back and burn $KARMA tokens. 80% of the burned $KARMA tokens will be reminted and distributed to Demeter farm for farming rewards on the Chameleon pools (initially XOR-ETH only) on Polkaswap.Kensetsu XOR will be explained in future articles, but let’s just say that there will likely be a whole lotta Kensetsu XOR created in the future.To up the stakes, to get an allocation of the initial $KARMA supply, you will literally have to burn money by burning XOR, the sexiest money there is.Burning XOR for fun and profit can be done using the nifty dotapps interface. Just click on this link, and fill out the form as follows:To fill out the form:Then sign the transaction and confirm that your XOR balance went down correctly, showing you burned the XOR.All XOR burned by calling the assets.burn extrinsic between blocks 15,739,737 and 16,056,666 will be considered in the calculated burned amount. To be eligible for the $KARMA drop, at least 100 million XOR should be burned by an account. 1 $KARMA will be given for each 100 million XOR burned.For example, if 99,999,999 XOR are burned, 0 $KARMA will be given to an account. If 100 million XOR are burned, 1 $KARMA will be given to an account. And if 169 million XOR are burned, then 1.69 $KARMA will be given to an account.So get out there and earn your $KARMA!SORA $KARMA Chameleon is just the first step towards the SORA v3 tokenomics.

This question resonates deeply with many, shedding light on why Nigerians have turned to stablecoins for protection against inflation.Imagine being able to acquire a cryptocurrency that functions just like cash, retaining its value while remaining as transferable and tradable as any other digital currency. Exciting, isn’t it?The primary objective of stablecoins is to create a cryptocurrency that maintains a steady value, shielded from the volatility and price fluctuations often seen in other cryptocurrencies.In essence, stablecoins offer the convenience, privacy, and security of cryptocurrencies, while ensuring the trust and stability typically associated with fiat money.Fiat money, such as the naira, dollar, or euro, refers to government-issued currency commonly used in our daily transactions.While stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is on the rise, there are indeed several challenges hindering its widespread usage.In this essay, we will delve into the obstacles limiting the adoption of stablecoins in Nigeria and explore potential growth strategies. They are:According to CoinDesk, stablecoins represent a category of cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable and consistent value by being pegged to another asset class.These coins aim to mitigate price fluctuations by linking their value to that of another currency, commodity, or financial instrument.Moreover, they offer an alternative to the high volatility often associated with popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Typically, the issuer of a stablecoin establishes a “reserve” where it securely holds the asset or a combination of assets backing the stablecoin’s value.For instance, they might deposit $1 million in a traditional bank to support one million units of the stablecoin.This approach ensures that digital stablecoins are backed by tangible assets in the physical world, with the funds in the reserve serving as collateral for the stablecoin.Hence, when a stablecoin holder wishes to redeem their tokens, an equivalent amount of the underlying asset is withdrawn from the reserve.Examples of stablecoins include Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Dai (DAI), Paxos Standard (PAX), and Binance USD (BUSD).Despite this, there exists a more intricate type of stablecoin collateralized by instruments other than fiat currency, which will be explored in the subsequent paragraphs.To comprehend the workings of stablecoins, it’s essential to explore the foundational principles that ensure their stability. In this regard, the following are the basic mechanisms of stablecoins:Fiat-collateralized stablecoins derive their value from fiat currency, meaning each coin is backed by a specific denomination such as the U.S. dollar.Consequently, the fiat currency backing may vary, encompassing Euros, Gold, or other denominations depending on the country.Tether stands out as one of the leading companies issuing its USDT stablecoin through fiat collateralization.However, there have been rumors suggesting that they may not possess a dollar for every USDT they have minted. As a result, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies are under constant scrutiny by regulators.Nevertheless, according to Forbes, Tether maintains that it possesses sufficient reserves to back the $66.9 billion of Tether tokens in circulation. Also, the company has yet to default on any redemption request.Algorithmic stablecoins may or may not maintain reserve assets. Their main difference lies in the approach of stabilizing the stablecoin’s value by managing its supply through an algorithm.Essentially, a computer program operates on a preset formula to manipulate the coin supply, thereby adjusting its price.This process bears some resemblance to central banks, which also stabilize currency value without depending on reserve assets.However, unlike algorithm mechanisms, central banks possess the transparency of public monetary policy formulation, and the established status and credibility associated with being the issuer of legal tender.During a crisis, algorithmic stablecoin issuers cannot rely on certain advantages. For instance, on May 11, 2022, the price of Terra USD (UST) dropped by over 60%, causing it to lose its value as compared to the U.S. dollar.According to a Chainalysis report, stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is gaining momentum, with many residents turning to it as a hedge against inflation.The chart below depicts the progression of stablecoin received by Nigeria exchanges monthly.Also, Chainalysis suggests that a significant driver of this trend is the growing demand for an alternative store of value amongst Nigerians, as inflation rates on the continent have surged.In Nigeria, inflation soared to a 30-year high of 28.9% in December 2023, as reported by Trading Economics, largely attributed to the significant depreciation of the naira.While stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is on the rise, significant challenges impede its widespread usage, with government regulations emerging as a major hurdle.Government authorities have expressed concerns about the potential impact of stablecoins on currency sovereignty, regulatory compliance and monetary policy.Stablecoins, especially those pegged to fiat currencies, could potentially undermine a government’s control over its monetary policy.If stablecoins gain widespread acceptance, they could reduce the effectiveness of central bank policies aimed at managing inflation, interest rates, and overall economic stability.For instance, suppose a country’s central bank implements a policy to decrease interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending.However, if a widely used stablecoin, such as one pegged to the US dollar, becomes preferred by consumers and businesses for transactions and savings due to its stability, the effectiveness of the central bank’s interest rate policy may be diminished.As more people opt to hold their wealth in stablecoins rather than the domestic currency, the central bank may find it challenging to influence borrowing and spending behaviors through traditional monetary policy tools.This could lead to a disconnect between the central bank’s intended policy objectives and the actual economic outcomes, potentially increasing their efforts to hinder the widespread adoption of stablecoins.In the government move towards regulating stablecoin adoption, Nigeria announced in February that it is preparing to launch its cNGN stablecoin within its regulatory sandbox.The Central Bank of Nigeria also announced that the stablecoins will be pegged to the Nigerian Naira and backed by Naira reserves in selected commercial banks.This initiative represents a bold step in improving Nigeria’s financial system. However, the introduction of the cNGN comes with several potential challenges that could impact its successful implementation.Building public trust is essential for the success of the cNGN. Skepticism towards government-issued digital currencies may arise, especially if they are seen as tools for increased surveillance or control.Also, the cNGN being pegged to the Nigerian Naira and backed by Naira reserves in selected commercial banks, introduces risks tied to the financial health and stability of these institutions.Any instability within these banks could negatively affect the stablecoin’s value and reliability.Furthermore, Nigeria has faced significant inflation and currency devaluation issues in the past. If the cNGN is pegged to the Naira, it may not effectively serve as a hedge against these economic challenges, potentially reducing its appeal as a stable store of value.As we delve deeper into stablecoin adoption in Nigeria and the challenges hindering its widespread usage, it’s essential to examine these issues from multiple perspectives.Apart from the regulatory hurdles posed by government authorities, there are significant challenges faced from both the user and business perspectives. Let’s explore these challenges in detail:When considering stablecoins from a user perspective, the following are some of the challenges that may arise:i. Lack of confidence: While Nigeria has seen a notable adoption rate of stablecoins, some potential users may still hesitate due to uncertainties surrounding the stability of the coin’s value or the reliability of the issuing platform.These concerns often revolve around issues such as regulatory compliance, transparency of reserves, and the overall trustworthiness of the stablecoin issuer.ii. Barriers to entry: Leveraging stablecoins and their platforms may pose technical challenges for some individuals, particularly if acquiring or utilizing stablecoins entails navigating intricate procedures or platforms.Factors such as account verification processes, and technical proficiency requirements can impede user adoption.iii. Stability concerns: There have been significant concerns regarding the sustainability and transparency of reserves supporting stablecoins.Tether, for instance, has faced allegations of misleading investors about its stablecoin reserves.Although stablecoins are designed to maintain value stability, users worry about potential sudden fluctuations or deviations from their intended peg.Such perceived instability could discourage users from relying on stablecoins for their intended purpose, such as transactions or wealth preservation.When considering stablecoins from a business perspective, the following are some of the challenges that may arise:i. Regulatory and compliance issues: Businesses face complex regulations as the government aims to ensure compliance with legal frameworks.In the realm of stablecoins, for instance, companies must navigate a complex array of rules covering digital currencies, financial services, anti-money laundering (AML), and know your customer (KYC) requirements.Yet, adhering to these regulations can mean higher operating costs and legal risks, especially in jurisdictions where rules are unclear or frequently changed.ii. Integration with established or existing financial systems: Integrating stablecoins into the existing financial system poses technical, and institutional challenges for businesses.Traditional financial institutions may be hesitant to adopt or partner with stablecoin issuers, due to concerns about the potential impact on their existing business models.Building interoperability between stablecoins and traditional payment systems requires overcoming technical hurdles, and gaining trust from stakeholders in the financial industry.Encounter a random individual in Nigeria, and it’s highly probable they’ve transacted in Naira. Despite Naira’s limited purchasing power, many individuals still favor it over cryptocurrencies for various reasons.Primarily, certain individuals are skeptical about cryptocurrencies, due to concerns about their reliability and volatility. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, often experiencing significant value fluctuations within short time frames.Consequently, numerous Nigerians opt for the stability offered by fiat currency like Naira for their day-to-day transactions.However, compared to Naira, stablecoins present advantages surpassing mere stability. They boast seamless transferability and tradability.As a cryptocurrency trader, simply holding Naira doesn’t facilitate easy trading or interaction with cryptocurrencies.Hence, stablecoins offer the privacy, security, and interoperability characteristic of cryptocurrencies, coupled with the stability and trust associated with fiat money.Illustrating the significant importance of stablecoins for Nigerians, consider Julius’s experience.On January 1st, 2023, Julius purchased 100 Bitcoins, valued at 100 dollars each. This is equivalent to 1 Bitcoin equaling 1 dollar.By May 2024, the value of 1 Bitcoin had surged to 10,000 dollars. As a result, his initial 100 Bitcoins were now worth 1,000,000 dollars.The calculation is straightforward: multiplying 10,000 dollars by 100 Bitcoins. Therefore, Julius currently possesses 100 Bitcoins valued at 1,000,000 dollars.Now, Julius intends to acquire a car, with payment being in Naira, the accepted fiat currency in Nigeria. However, he is reluctant to deplete his entire trading proceeds.Consequently, he divides his Bitcoin holdings in half, resulting in 50 Bitcoins each. Subsequently, he sells 50 Bitcoins for 500,000 dollars. Then he converts it to Naira, valuing a whooping sum of 5,000,000.This leaves him with 50 Bitcoins, valued at 500,000 dollars. Realizing the volatility of Bitcoin, Julius, being a savvy trader, exchanges his 50 Bitcoins for 50 USDC stablecoins to preserve its value.Now, he can monitor the market and potentially repurchase Bitcoin with some USDC when its price and value decline.The story of Julius demonstrates how stablecoins can provide a safe haven for traders in volatile markets, offering a balance of stability and flexibility that is essential for managing both local and international transactions.Delving into the applications of stablecoins, we unveil the top use cases driving the transformative power of this cutting-edge financial technology. They include:A popular use case for stablecoins is providing liquidity for crypto traders.On exchanges, stablecoins can be one half of a trading pair, allowing traders to quickly move in and out of positions without exposing their portfolios to unwanted risks.As they await the next opportunity, stablecoins enable traders to maintain the value of their assets without having to convert them to fiat currency.According to Bitcoin Market Journal, as of February 2023, more than $24.5 billion was invested in the leading stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and DAI. Lending and staking are methods that provide funds to exchanges and institutions.Unlike Ethereum, which uses a Proof-of-Stake system, stablecoins like USDT and USDC do not.Staking these stablecoins is more like a high-interest savings account. However, the downside is that you can’t access or transfer your crypto during a specific lockup period.Essentially, you trade easy access to your funds for the potential of higher earnings. The significant amount of money in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) can be seen by looking at the total value locked (TVL) in these protocols.TVL represents the total amount of assets dedicated to lending and borrowing. Right now, the top three assets by TVL are stablecoins: USDT, USDC, and DAI.On-ramps are the platforms where you buy cryptocurrency, while off-ramps are where you convert crypto back to regular money (fiat).Stablecoins connect traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi), and make it easier to switch between the two.While you can use your fiat currency to buy any digital asset, stablecoins are widely supported because DeFi platforms and protocols are confident in their stability.Stablecoins can be used for sending money across borders and for remittances. They eliminate the need for third-party institutions, cutting down costs related to exchange rates and transfer fees.Transactions are verified on the blockchain, reducing processing times from days to minutes. Unlike other digital currencies, stablecoins minimize the risk of price volatility in remittances.To enhance stablecoin adoption in Nigeria, it is crucial to address the existing challenges effectively.Here are some strategies that, when implemented adequately, could facilitate the growth of stablecoin adoption in Nigeria:Stablecoin issuers should regularly publish audit results and detailed reserve information to assure users and businesses of their stability and backing.Furthermore, they should share success stories and case studies demonstrating how individuals and businesses in Nigeria have benefited from using stablecoins.Dialogues should be established among stablecoin issuers, blockchain associations, fintech companies, and Nigerian regulatory bodies such as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).This collaboration can help create clear and favorable regulatory frameworks.Stablecoin issuers can also collaborate with local banks to facilitate seamless conversion between fiat currencies and stablecoins, making on-ramps and off-ramps more accessible.Additionally, they could partner with mobile money operators to integrate stablecoins into existing mobile payment systems, leveraging the widespread use of mobile banking in Nigeria.Stablecoin issuers can facilitate user adoption by creating user-friendly platforms and applications, simplifying account setup, verification processes, and transaction procedures.Also, developing stablecoin solutions tailored to local needs, including interfaces in local languages and customer support services that incorporate local context could go a long way.Create forums, online groups, and local meetups to build a community around stablecoin use and adoption.Existing crypto communities can be leveraged as well to build a strong opinion around stablecoin adoption in Nigeria.Initiatives designed to educate the public about the benefits and uses of stablecoins should be launched, addressing common misconceptions and fears.Additionally, training programs for businesses on how to integrate stablecoins into their operations should be created, highlighting potential cost savings and efficiency improvements.In conclusion, while stablecoin adoption in Nigeria faces challenges, strategic approaches can drive its growth. Transparency in auditing, collaboration with regulators, and partnerships with local banks and mobile money operators are crucial.Improving user experience, fostering community engagement, and education initiatives can also accelerate adoption.By addressing these challenges with tailored solutions, stablecoins can realize their full potential in Nigeria’s financial ecosystem, offering stability and efficiency in digital transactions.~~If you found this interesting to read, please feel free to leave at least 50 claps 😁 \u0026 a follow.For collaborations, features or promotion, reach out via email: (graciousjohn640@gmail.com).X: JohnGraceeyLinkedIn: Gracious John~~","tags":["Coins","Stable Coin","Cryptocurrency","Central Bank","Blockchain"],"author":"Gracious John"},{"article_link":"https://medium.com/star-atlas/sold-out-star-atlas-sells-all-five-thousand-pre-sale-crew-pack-bundles-in-less-than-24-hours-5b6fd39d9aba","website_source":"Medium","article_type":"Blog Post","summary":"In a dazzling demonstration of passion and excitement, the Star Atlas community has swept all five thousand Pre-Sale Crew Pack bundles…","title":"SOLD OUT! — Star Atlas Sells All Five Thousand Pre-Sale Crew Pack Bundles in Less Than 24 Hours…","detailed_content":"In a dazzling demonstration of passion and excitement, the Star Atlas community has swept all five thousand Pre-Sale Crew Pack bundles from the galactic marketplace.

His defense team says it will appeal, saying the crypto-tracing technique at the heart of the case is “pseudoscience.”","title":"The Science of Crypto Forensics Survives a Court Battle—for Now","detailed_content":"On March 12, Russian-Swedish national Roman Sterlingov was found guilty of money laundering conspiracy and other violations by a federal jury in Washington, DC, for having operated Bitcoin Fog, a service criminals used to launder what authorities claim was hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.\nThe conviction was heralded by the US Department of Justice as a victory over crypto-enabled criminality, but Sterlingov’s lawyers maintain the case against him was flawed and plan to appeal. They allege that the nascent science used to collect evidence against him is not fit for the purpose.\nThe DOJ investigation used blockchain forensics, a technique whereby investigators scrutinize the public trail of crypto transactions to map the flow of funds. In a statement, Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general for the US, described the DOJ as “painstakingly tracing bitcoin through the blockchain” to identify Sterlingov as the pseudonymous administrator behind Bitcoin Fog.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acquired an undeserved reputation for being less traceable than conventional money, but evidence collected this way has brought down many criminals over the past decade. Blockchain forensics was crucial to the trial of Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous Silk Road marketplace. But in the Bitcoin Fog case, the defense has pulled this investigative technique into the spotlight, effectively putting crypto tracing on trial in place of their client. The case is a “first-of-its-kind,” says Tor Ekeland, legal counsel to Sterlingov. “Nobody has challenged blockchain forensics before, because it’s brand-new.”\nBefore Sterlingov’s trial, his attorneys asked the presiding judge to determine the admissibility of evidence from blockchain forensics experts that had used software from a firm called Chainalysis, which expedites the otherwise tedious process of sifting through the blockchain. He ruled the evidence was admissible.\nThat decision has been characterized by Michael Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, as an endorsement of his firm and its methods. “We are now the only company in the world with a stamp of approval for our ability to look at a blockchain and create evidence,” he says. But Ekeland says he will work with Sterlingov to appeal both the guilty verdict and the judge’s ruling on the validity of blockchain forensics. The conviction of Sterlingov is the latest example of the unhappy phenomenon, claims Ekeland, whereby “newly emergent junk science leads to unjust verdicts.”\nBeth Bisbee of Chainalysis, formerly the company’s head of US investigations, disputes that characterization. “The evidence that the government presented to the jury demonstrated the exact opposite,” says Bisbee, who testified as an expert witness at the trial. “Our methods are transparent, tested, reviewed, and reliable.”\nNatsec Threat\nUntil it was shut down by US law enforcement in 2021, Bitcoin Fog supplied what\u0027s known as a crypto mixing or crypto tumbling service. Funds belonging to many parties are pooled, jumbled up, and spat out into brand-new wallets, masking the origin of the coins held in each. Mixers were originally promoted as a way to improve the level of privacy cryptocurrency could afford consumers, but they have been readily co-opted for the purpose of money laundering. Bitcoin Fog was among the first mixers to emerge, in 2011, making it “the longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet,” the DOJ says.\nIn the past few years, the US government has cracked down on crypto mixers, which it considers a threat to national security. After taking down Bitcoin Fog, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, another mixer, in 2022. The year after, it took down another, ChipMixer, and charged the founder with money laundering. To identify the individuals behind these operations, investigators had to follow the crypto money.In crypto’s earliest years, the pseudonymous nature of transactions—whereby coins are exchanged between wallets identified only by an alphanumeric address—was frequently mistaken for anonymity. But beginning in late 2012 with the work of cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn, now a professor at University College London, among others, researchers began to figure out ways to group crypto wallets together, revealing connections that implied shared ownership. “Ultimately, you’re trying to link one pile of money to another,” says Meiklejohn. With this new knowledge, it became possible to attribute wallets to specific crypto exchanges or marketplaces, and to follow stolen funds. To identify the people who owned particular wallets, law enforcement could subpoena the exchanges they used to convert crypto into regular money. Logged on an open ledger for all to see, crypto transactions were not remotely anonymous.\nThis general methodology—which Meiklejohn termed “clustering”—was taken up, further developed, and packaged into blockchain forensics services offered by firms like Chainalysis, which was used by the DOJ to help prosecute Sterlingov. “In academia, we are pretty far behind the state of the art at this point,” says Meiklejohn. “We sort of accept that this is just an industry now.”\nThe professionalization of blockchain forensics is central to Sterlingov’s defense strategy in the Bitcoin Fog case. It is impossible to audit the clustering performed by the government for accuracy, a report commissioned by the defense submitted ahead of the trial claimed, because the inner workings of Chainalysis’ software are private. There has been no peer review of the specific methodology the company uses, says Ekeland, nor is there any standards body for the blockchain forensics industry. “It should be illegal to use black box software in criminal prosecutions—it should be open source. It violates a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confront their accuser. It’s unconstitutional,” he claims. Chainalysis says the hearings on the admissibility of the company’s evidence served as a check on its reliability.\n“Mushrooming Effect”\nThe defense also disputes the way in which blockchain forensics evidence was interpreted, to finger Sterlingov as the operator of Bitcoin Fog. Although wallets belonging to Sterlingov might have interacted with the mixer, that does not prove him the service’s operator, they argue. “The problem isn’t so much that the blockchain is lying,” says Ekeland. “The flow of funds is not the same as the flow of control.”\nWhile the government presented other forms of evidence it said tied Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog, like analysis of IP addresses linking him to the ownership of the web domain, Ekeland believes the blockchain forensics was critical in convincing the jury of his guilt. “The ‘CSI effect’ really hurt us,” he says. “The jury placed undue importance on pseudoscientific evidence, because it was presented in a fancy chart and by the government.”\nThe academics with whom the science of crypto tracing originated acknowledge that it should not be applied as evidence in isolation, or mischaracterized as some sort of a smoking gun. There remains some art to interpreting the information produced by blockchain analysis, says Meiklejohn, which introduces the opportunity for error. “You still have to decide if it means what you think it means, or whether there are other explanations,” she says.“I would not be comfortable [with blockchain forensics being the only form of evidence],” says Philip Koshy, who alongside his wife Diana Koshy demonstrated in 2014 a way to identify the IP addresses associated with certain bitcoin transactions. “It ends up becoming scientific only if you can determine ground truth, using subpoena power.”\nThe judge in the Sterlingov case pointed out in his ruling on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence that the DOJ had additional evidence pointing to the accused. “This is not a case in which the government’s theory that Sterlingov was the operator of Bitcoin Fog turns exclusively, or even primarily, [on blockchain forensics],” he wrote. In order to “establish that crucial point,” the judge noted, the government relied upon a range of information external to any blockchain, from IP addresses to forum posts.\nThe judge also took issue with the depiction of Chainalysis software as an inscrutable black box, on the grounds that the defense had been given information about its workings—Ekeland disputes this characterization—and pointed out that the underlying heuristics applied by the firm have been subject to peer review, even if its specific clustering methods have not been.\nFor maximum transparency, Chainalysis could open-source its software, but doing so would risk handing an advantage to bad actors. “This is a cat and mouse game,” says Mieklejohn. “Once you publish the heuristics, people understand how they work, and then they can take steps to evade those heuristics.” In the circumstances, argues Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, the hearings on admissibility—during which the company’s work came under heavy scrutiny—is the next best thing to a traditional peer review.\nIn the end, the effort to cast doubt over the reliability of blockchain forensics bore no fruit for the defense. “The Court is persuaded that blockchain analytics in general, and [Chainalysis’ software] in particular, is not junk science,” wrote the judge, in his summation on the admissibility question.\nThe ruling does not set a precedent that other US judges must follow, because the case has been confined so far to a district court. Nonetheless, Gronager is hopeful it will be the “final word” on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence, at least until future developments in crypto tracing demand a reevaluation. “This is a landmark ruling,” adds Bisbee of Chainalysis.\nWhile Ekeland is concerned about a “mushrooming effect,” whereby the ruling will figure in the thinking of future judges, he claims the matter “could take years to gel one way or the other.” Among other quarrels with the way the case was tried, the use of blockchain forensic evidence will form part of the basis for Sterlingov’s appeal. “Right now, the momentum is in their favor,” says Ekeland. “But it’s still an open battlefield.”","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRYPTOCURRENCIES","CRIME","DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE","MONEY","FINANCE"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2024-03-27"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/a-last-ditch-plan-to-save-the-crypto-industry/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"In his new book Read Write Own, investor Chris Dixon mounts a defense of blockchain, arguing it can save society from the monopoly power of tech giants.","title":"A Last-Ditch Plan to Save the Crypto Industry","detailed_content":"A survey of headlines from the past couple of years in the cryptocurrency industry might lead anyone to believe that it is a deeply unserious business.","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","INVESTING","VENTURE CAPITAL","FTX TRIAL","INTERNET CULTURE","ANTITRUST"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2024-01-26"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-crypto-tracing-model-money-laundering/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model—and the 200-million-transaction dataset it\u0027s trained on—that aims to spot the “shape” of bitcoin money laundering.","title":"A Vast New Data Set Could Supercharge the AI Hunt for Crypto Money Laundering","detailed_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can\u0027t see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

Now, a dispute within the criminal underground has revealed a new development in that unfolding debacle: One of the partners of the hackers behind the attack points out that those hackers, a group known as AlphV or BlackCat, received a $22 million transaction that looks very much like a large ransom payment.\nOn March 1, a Bitcoin address connected to AlphV received 350 bitcoins in a single transaction, or close to $22 million based on exchange rates at the time. Then, two days later, someone describing themselves as an affiliate of AlphV—one of the hackers who work with the group to penetrate victim networks—posted to the cybercriminal underground forum RAMP that AlphV had cheated them out of their share of the Change Healthcare ransom, pointing to the publicly visible $22 million transaction on Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain as proof.\nThey Cracked the Code to a Locked USB Drive Worth $235 Million in Bitcoin. Then It Got Weird\nStefan Thomas lost the password to an encrypted USB drive holding 7,002 bitcoins. One team of hackers believes they can unlock it—if they can get Thomas to let them.\nBY ANDY GREENBERG\nThat suggests, according to Dmitry Smilyanets, the researcher for security firm Recorded Future who first spotted the post, that Change Healthcare has likely paid AlphV\u0027s ransom. “You can see the number of coins that landed there. You don’t see that kind of transaction so often,” Smilyanets says. “There’s proof of a large amount landing in the AlphV-controlled Bitcoin wallet. And this affiliate connects this address to the attack on Change Healthcare. So it’s likely that the victim paid the ransom.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\nJavier Bardem Answers the Web\u0027s Most Searched Questions\nA spokesperson for Change Healthcare, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group, declined to answer whether it had paid a ransom to AlphV, telling WIRED only that “we are focused on the investigation right now.”\nBoth Recorded Future and TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm, connect the Bitcoin address that received the $22 million payment to the AlphV hackers. TRM Labs says it can link the address to payments from two other AlphV victims in January.\nIf Change Healthcare did pay a $22 million ransom, it would not only represent a huge payday for AlphV, but also a dangerous precedent for the health care industry, argues Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused researcher with security firm Emsisoft. Every ransomware payment, he says, both funds future attacks by the group responsible and suggests to other ransomware predators that they should try the same playbook—in this case, attacking health care services that patients depend on.\n“If Change did pay, it\u0027s problematic,” says Callow. “It highlights the profitability of attacks on the health care sector. Ransomware gangs are nothing if not predictable: If they find a particular sector to be lucrative, they’ll attack it over and over again, rinse and repeat.”\nThe self-described AlphV affiliate who first posted evidence of the payment on RAMP, and who goes by the name “notchy,” complained that AlphV had apparently collected the $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare and then kept the entire sum, rather than share the profits with their hacking partner as they had allegedly agreed. “Be careful everyone and stop deal with ALPHV,\" notchy wrote.That affiliate hacker also wrote that in their penetration of Change Healthcare\u0027s network, they had accessed the data of numerous other health care firms partnered with the company. If that claim is accurate, Recorded Future\u0027s Smilyanets points out, it creates the additional risk that the affiliate hacker still possesses sensitive medical information. Even if Change Healthcare did pay AlphV, the hacker affiliate could still demand additional payment or leak the data independently.\n“The affiliates still have this data, and they’re mad they didn’t receive this money,” says Smilyanets. “It’s a good lesson for everyone. You cannot trust criminals; their word is worth nothing.”\nAs ransomware payments go, $22 million would represent a remarkably profitable score for AlphV. Only a relatively small number of ransoms in the history of ransomware, such as the $40 million payment made by the financial firm CNA to the hackers known as Evil Corp, have been so large, says Emsisoft\u0027s Callow. “It’s not without precedent, but it’s certainly very unusual,” he says.\nRegardless of whether Change Healthcare is confirmed to have paid that ransom, the attack shows that AlphV has pulled off a disturbing comeback: In December, it was the target of an FBI operation that seized its dark web sites and released decryption keys that foiled its attacks on hundreds of victims. Just two months later, it carried out the cyberattack that paralyzed Change Healthcare, triggering an outage whose effects on pharmacies and their patients have now stretched well beyond a week. As of last Tuesday, AlphV listed 28 companies on the dark web site it uses to extort its victims, not including Change Healthcare.\nThat site has now gone offline. As of Tuesday morning, it displayed what appeared to be a law enforcement seizure notice, but security researcher Fabian Wosar points out that the notice seems to have been copied from AlphV\u0027s last takedown. The reason for the group\u0027s disappearance—whether due to another law enforcement operation or AlphV\u0027s attempts to dodge its own cheated affiliates—is unclear. Ransomware trackers say AlphV has disappeared and rebranded several times before. Earlier incarnations under the name BlackCat, BlackMatter, and Darkside were all more or less the same group, security researchers note.\nIn fact, the hackers working under that Darkside handle were responsible for the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that triggered the shutdown of gas transportation across the Eastern Seaboard of the US and resulted in a brief fuel shortage in some East Coast cities. In that case, too, the victims paid the hackers\u0027 ransom. “It was the hardest decision I\u0027ve made,” Colonial\u0027s CEO Joseph Blount later told a US congressional hearing.\nNow, it seems, some of the same hackers may have forced yet another company to make that same hard decision.\nUpdate 3/4/2024, 1:50 pm EST: Included additional contextual details about AlphV and related ransomware attacks.\nUpdated 3/5/2024, 10:30 am EST to note that AlphV\u0027s dark web site now displays what appears to be a law enforcement takedown message.","tags":["","RANSOMWARE","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME","HEALTHCARE"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2024-03-04"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-heist-sim-swat-indictment/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"An indictment against three Americans suggests that at least some of the culprits behind the theft of an FTX crypto fortune may be in custody.","title":"The Mystery of the $400 Million FTX Heist May Have Been Solved","detailed_content":"When more than $400 million worth of crypto was mysteriously pulled out of the coffers of what was once the world\u0027s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, on the very day that it declared bankruptcy in November of 2022, many initially suspected insiders at the company—including, potentially, then CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, now convicted of fraud.

That discovery would upend the world of cybercrime. Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world’s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web’s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nThat 180-degree flip in the world’s understanding of cryptocurrency’s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin’s blockchain. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn’s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer’s mining power to 11 different mining “pools,” groups that collected users’ computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\nPHOTOGRAPH: PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nWalmart\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\nMeiklejohn’s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin’s anonymity—or lack thereof—made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists’ idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous.\nA collage from Meiklejohn’s research paper showing every object she bought with Bitcoin in her tracing experiments.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNAS MEIKLEJOHN PAINSTAKINGLY fiddled with bitcoins and watched the digital trails they created, she found herself having flashbacks to a particular day, decades earlier, in her mother’s downtown Manhattan office. That morning, Meiklejohn and her mother had taken the subway together, all the way from their Upper West Side apartment near the American Museum of Natural History to the federal building at Foley Square, across from the city’s intimidating, stone-columned courthouses.\nMeiklejohn was still in elementary school, but it was take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Meiklejohn’s mother was a federal prosecutor. Over the years that followed, the elder Meiklejohn would make her career taking on contractors who were bilking the city government out of tax dollars—bribing government staffers to choose overpriced school food or street-paving services—or else banks colluding to sell low-performing investments to the city’s financiers. Many of her targets in those corruption probes would be sentenced to years in prison.\nThat day in the Justice Department’s New York office, Sarah Meiklejohn, not yet 10 years old, was put to work. She was assigned to comb through a pile of paper checks, searching for clues of a corrupt kickback scheme in one of her mother’s investigations.\nIt was that feeling, the drive to manually assemble tiny data points that built into a larger picture, that would give Meiklejohn a kind of déjà vu 20 years later as she studied the Bitcoin blockchain, even before she consciously knew what she was doing.\n“Somewhere in the back of my mind was this idea,” says Meiklejohn, “the idea of following the money.”\nAs a child, Meiklejohn loved puzzles—the more complex, the better. On road trips, in airports, or any other time the small-for-her-age, hyper-inquisitive girl needed to be distracted, her mother would hand her a book of puzzles. One of the first websites Meiklejohn remembers visiting on the nascent World Wide Web was a GeoCities page devoted to deciphering the Kryptos sculpture on the campus of the CIA, whose copper, ribbonlike surface contained four coded messages that even the cryptanalysts at Langley hadn’t been able to crack. By the age of 14 she would finish the New York Times crossword puzzle every day of the week.\nOn a vacation to London, Meiklejohn’s family visited the British Museum, and Meiklejohn became fixated on the Rosetta stone, along with the broader notion of ancient languages—the remnants of entire cultures—that could be deciphered if the puzzler simply found the right key. Soon she was reading about Linear A and Linear B, a pair of written scripts used by the Minoan civilization on Crete until roughly 1500 BC. Linear B had been deciphered only in the 1950s, thanks in large part to a classicist at Brooklyn College named Alice Kober who labored in obscurity over samples of the Bronze Age language for 20 years, writing her notes on 180,000 index cards.\nMeiklejohn became so obsessed with Linear A and B that she persuaded a teacher at her middle school to organize an evening seminar on the subject (only she and one friend attended). More tantalizing than even the story of Alice Kober’s work on Linear B, for Meiklejohn, was the fact that no one had been able to decipher Linear A, even after a century of study. The best puzzles of all were the ones that had no answer key—the ones for which no one even knew if a solution existed.When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction—what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier’s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can’t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that “unbreakable” system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications—whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists—where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\nMEIKLEJOHN SHOWED REAL talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier’s law in more than 30 years.\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master’s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya’s wing, researching methods to make Chaum’s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster’s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier’s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n“You could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,” Meiklejohn remembers thinking. “If you don’t get privacy, what do you get?”\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research—systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin’s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin’s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations— essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition—whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin’s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.Considering Bitcoin’s mechanics for the first time, Meiklejohn was intrigued. But when she got home from the hike and began poring over Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper, it immediately became clear to her that Bitcoin’s trade-offs were the exact opposite of the eCash system she knew so well. Fraud was prevented not by a kind of after-the-fact forgery analysis carried out by a bank authority but with an instantaneous check of the blockchain, the unforgeable public record of who possessed every single bitcoin.\nBut that blockchain ledger system came at an enormous privacy cost: In Bitcoin, for good and for ill, everyone was a witness to every payment. Yes, identities behind those payments were obscured by pseudonymous addresses, long strings of between 26 and 35 characters. But to Meiklejohn, this seemed like an inherently dangerous sort of fig leaf to hide behind. Unlike eCash, whose privacy protections offered snoops no hint of revealing information to latch onto, Bitcoin offered an enormous collection of data to analyze. Who could say what sorts of patterns might give away users who thought they were cleverer than those watching them?\n“You could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,” Meiklejohn remembers thinking. “And so as a cryptographer, the natural question was, if you can’t prove it’s private, then what attacks are possible? If you don’t get privacy, what do you get?”\nThe temptation was more than Meiklejohn could resist. The blockchain, like a massive, undeciphered corpus of an ancient language, hid a wealth of secrets in plain view.\nWHEN MEIKLEJOHN BEGAN digging into the blockchain in late 2012, she started with a very simple question: How many people were using bitcoin?\nThat number was much harder to pin down than it might seem. After downloading the entire blockchain onto a UCSD server and organizing it into a database that she could query, like a gargantuan, searchable spreadsheet, she could see that there were more than 12 million distinct Bitcoin addresses, among which there had been nearly 16 million transactions. But even amid all that activity, there were plenty of recognizable events in Bitcoin’s history visible to the naked eye. Spenders and recipients might have been hidden behind pseudonymous addresses, but some transactions were unmistakable, like distinctive pieces of furniture hidden under thin sheets in someone’s attic.\nShe could see, for instance, the nearly 1 million bitcoins that were mined by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency, before others started using it, as well as the first transaction ever made when Satoshi sent 10 coins as a test to the early Bitcoin developer Hal Finney in January 2009. She spotted, too, the first payment with real value, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz famously sold a friend two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010 (as of this writing worth hundreds of millions of dollars).\nPlenty of other addresses and transactions had been recognized and widely discussed on forums like Bitcointalk, and Meiklejohn spent hours cutting and pasting long strings of characters into Google to see if someone had already claimed credit for an address or if other Bitcoin users had been gossiping about certain high-value transactions. By the time Meiklejohn began to look, anyone with enough interest and patience to wade through a sea of garbled addresses could see money transfers between mysterious parties just beneath the surface of the blockchain’s obfuscation that, even at the time, were often worth small fortunes.Getting beyond that obfuscation, however, was the real challenge. Sure, Meiklejohn could see transactions between addresses. But the problem was drilling down further, definitively drawing a boundary around the bitcoin hoard of any single person or organization. A user could have as many addresses as they chose to create with one of the many wallet programs that managed their coins—like a bank that allows you to spread your wealth across as many accounts as you liked, creating new ones with a mouse click. Plenty of those programs even automatically generated new addresses every time the user received a bitcoin payment, adding to the confusion.\nStill, Meiklejohn was sure that searching for patterns in the mess of transactions would allow her to untangle at least some of them. In Satoshi Nakamoto’s own original white paper, Meiklejohn recalled that he had briefly alluded to a technique that could be used to collapse some addresses into single identities. Often, a single bitcoin transaction has multiple “inputs” from different addresses. If someone wants to pay a friend 10 bitcoins but holds those coins at two different addresses of five coins each, the spender’s wallet software creates a single transaction that lists the two five-coin addresses as inputs and the address receiving 10 coins as the output. To make the payment possible, the payer would need to possess both of the so-called secret keys that allow the five coins at each address to be spent. That means anyone looking at the transaction on the blockchain can reasonably identify both of the input addresses as belonging to the same person or organization.\nSatoshi had hinted at the privacy dangers this introduced. “Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,” Satoshi wrote. “The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.”\nSo, as Meiklejohn’s first step, she simply tried the technique Satoshi had inadvertently suggested—across every bitcoin payment ever carried out. She scanned her blockchain database for every multi-input transaction, linking all of those double, triple, or even hundredfold inputs to single identities. The result immediately reduced the number of potential Bitcoin users from 12 million to date to around 5 million, slicing away more than half of the problem.\nMeiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked.\nOnly after that initial step—practically a freebie—did Meiklejohn switch her brain into true puzzle-solving mode. Like a 20th-century archaeologist scanning hieroglyphics for identifiable words or phrases that might help to decipher a passage of text, she began to hunt through Bitcoin’s transactions for other clues that might reveal identifying information. Messing around with bitcoin wallets—making test payments to herself and her colleagues—she began to understand a quirk of the cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin wallets only allowed spenders to pay the entire amount of coins sitting at a certain address. Each address was like a piggy bank that has to be smashed open to spend the coins inside. Spend less than the whole amount in that piggy bank and the leftovers have to be stored in a newly created piggy bank.\nThis second piggy bank, in Bitcoin’s system, is called a “change” address: When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient’s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn’t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address—a piggy bank that had materialized on the spot to receive leftover coins from the one that had just been shattered. And that meant these two piggy banks—the spender’s address and the change address—must belong to the same person.\nMeiklejohn began to apply that change-making lens, looking for instances where she could link spenders and the remainders of their payments. She began to see how powerful the simple act of tracking bitcoin change could be: In instances where she couldn’t distinguish a recipient address from a change address, she would be stuck at a fork in the road with no signposts. But if she could link change addresses to the addresses they had split off from, she could make her own signposts. She could follow the money despite its branching paths.\nThe result was that Meiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked: A single sum of coins would move from change address to change address as the spender paid fractions of the total pile of coins in one small payment after another. The remainder of the pile might move to a fresh address with each payment, but those addresses must all represent the transactions of a single spender.\nShe’d come to refer to those chains of transactions as “peeling chains” (or sometimes just “peel chains”). She thought of them like someone peeling bills off a roll of dollar bills: Though the roll of bills might be put back in a different pocket after a bill was peeled off and spent, it was still fundamentally one wad of cash with a consistent owner. Following these peeling chains opened avenues to trace the digital money’s movements like never before.\nMeiklejohn now had two clever techniques, both of which were capable of linking multiple Bitcoin addresses to a single person or organization, what she came to call “clustering.” What had initially looked like disparate addresses could now be connected into clusters that encompassed hundreds or, in some cases, even thousands of addresses.\nAlready, she was tracing bitcoins in ways that many of the cryptocurrency’s users wouldn’t have believed possible. But following coins didn’t necessarily mean understanding who owned them. The identities behind those coins remained a mystery, and each of her clusters remained just as pseudonymous as the single, disconnected addresses had been originally. To put a name to those clusters, she began to realize, she’d have to take a much more hands-on approach: not simply observing the artifacts of the Bitcoin economy after the fact like an archaeologist, but becoming a player in it herself—in some cases, an undercover one.\nSEARCHING FOR GUIDANCE in her budding Bitcoin research, Meiklejohn turned to Stefan Savage, a UCSD professor who was on the other end of the spectrum from the deeply mathematical cryptography research Meiklejohn had spent years on. Savage was a hands-on, empirical researcher, more interested in real-world experiments with real-world results than abstractions. He had been one of the lead advisers of a now-legendary team of researchers who had first shown it was possible to hack a car over the internet, demonstrating to General Motors in 2011 that his team could remotely take over a Chevy Impala’s steering and brakes via the cellular radio in its OnStar system, a shocking feat of hacker wizardry.More recently, Savage had helped lead a group that included Kirill Levchenko—the scientist who’d introduced Meiklejohn to Bitcoin on their desert hike—working on a massively ambitious project to track the spam email ecosystem. In that research, as with the earlier car-hacking breakthrough, Savage’s team hadn’t been afraid to get their hands dirty: They’d collected hundreds of millions of web links in junk marketing emails, mostly ones intended to sell real and fake pharmaceuticals. Then, as Savage describes it, they acted out the role of “the world’s most gullible person,” using bots to click through on every one of those links to see where they led and spending more than $50,000 on the products the spammers were hawking—all while working with a cooperative credit card issuer to trace the funds and see which banks ended up with the money.\nSeveral of those shady banks were ultimately shut down as a result of the researchers’ tracing work. As another UCSD professor working on the project, Geoffrey Voelker, described it at the time, “Our secret weapon is shopping.”\nSo when Meiklejohn began talking over her Bitcoin tracking project with Savage, the two agreed she should take the same approach: She would manually identify Bitcoin addresses one by one by doing transactions with them herself, like a cop on the narcotics beat carrying out buy-and-busts.\nThat’s how Meiklejohn found herself in the early weeks of 2013 ordering coffee, cupcakes, trading cards, mugs, baseball hats, silver coins, socks, and a closet’s worth of other truly random objects from online vendors who accepted bitcoin; joining more than a dozen mining collectives; fiendishly gambling bitcoins at every online crypto casino she could find; and moving bitcoins into and out of accounts on practically every existing bitcoin exchange—and the Silk Road—again and again.\nThe hundreds of addresses Meiklejohn identified and tagged manually with those 344 transactions represented only the tiniest fraction of the overall bitcoin landscape. But when she combined her address tagging with her chaining and clustering techniques, many of those tags suddenly identified not just a single address but an enormous cluster belonging to the same owner. With just a few hundred tags, she had put an identity to more than a million of Bitcoin’s once-pseudonymous addresses.\nA chart from Meiklejohn’s paper showing her “clustering” of Bitcoin addresses for early cryptocurrency entities.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNWith just the 30 addresses she had identified by moving coins into and out of Mt. Gox, for instance, she could now link more than 500,000 addresses to the exchange. And based on just four deposits and seven withdrawals into wallets on the Silk Road, she was able to identify nearly 300,000 of the black market’s addresses. This breakthrough didn’t mean Meiklejohn could identify any actual users of the Silk Road by name, nor could she unmask, of course, the mysterious kingpin of that site, the ultra libertarian Dread Pirate Roberts. But it would directly contradict DPR’s claims to me that his Bitcoin “tumbler” system could prevent observers from even seeing when users moved cryptocurrency into and out of their Silk Road accounts.\nWhen Meiklejohn brought her results back to Savage, her adviser was impressed. But as they began to plan to publish a paper on her findings, he wanted a concrete demonstration for readers, not a bunch of arcane statistics. “We need to show people,” Meiklejohn remembers him saying, “what these techniques can actually do.”\nSo Meiklejohn went a step further: She began to look for specific bitcoin transactions she could track—particularly criminal ones.\nAS MEIKLEJOHN HAD trawled cryptocurrency forums for discussions of interesting addresses worth scrutinizing, one mysterious mountain of money in particular stood out: This single address had, over the course of 2012, accumulated 613,326 bitcoins—5 percent of all the coins in circulation. It represented around $7.5 million at the time, a figure nowhere near the billions it would represent today, but a heady sum nonetheless. Rumors among Bitcoin users suggested that the hoard was possibly a Silk Road wallet, or perhaps the result of an unrelated, notorious Bitcoin Ponzi scheme carried out by a user known as pirate@40.\nMeiklejohn couldn’t say which of the two rumors might be correct. But with her clustering techniques, she could now follow that giant sum of cryptocurrency. She saw that after conspicuously gathering at one address, the pile of money had been broken up in late 2012 and sent on forking paths around the blockchain. Meiklejohn’s understanding of peel chains meant she could now trace those sums of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as they split, distinguishing the amount that remained in the control of the initial owner from the smaller sums that were peeled off in subsequent payments. Eventually, several of those peel chains led to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, where they seemed to be cashed out for traditional currency. For an academic researcher, this was a dead end. But anyone with the subpoena power of law enforcement, Meiklejohn realized, could very likely force those exchanges to hand over information about the accounts behind those transactions and solve the mystery of the $7.5 million stash.\nFar from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\nLooking for more coins to hunt, Meiklejohn turned her focus to another sort of dirty money. Large-scale cryptocurrency heists were, in early 2013, a growing epidemic. After all, bitcoin was like cash or gold. Anyone who stole a Bitcoin address’s secret key could empty out that address like a digital safe. Unlike with credit cards or other digital payment systems, there was no overseer who could stop or reverse the money’s movement. That had made every bitcoin business and its stash of crypto revenue a ripe target for hackers, especially if the holders of those funds made the mistake of storing their secret keys on internet-connected computers—the equivalent of carrying six- or seven-figure sums of cash in their pockets while strolling through a dangerous neighborhood.\nMeiklejohn found a thread on Bitcointalk that listed addresses of many of the biggest, most conspicuous crypto thefts in recent memory, and she began to follow the money. Looking at a robbery of 3,171 coins from an early bitcoin gambling site, she immediately found she could trace the stolen funds across no fewer than ten hops, from address to address, before different branches of the money were cashed out at exchanges. Another theft of 18,500 bitcoins from the exchange Bitcoinica similarly led her along a winding series of peel chains that ended at three other exchanges, where the robbers were no doubt cashing in their ill-gotten gains. Sitting in front of Meiklejohn, on her screen, was a bonanza of leads, each just waiting for any actual criminal investigator with a handful of subpoenas to follow them.Now, when Meiklejohn showed Savage her results, he agreed: They were ready to publish.\nIn the final draft of the paper Meiklejohn and her coauthors put together, they definitively stated conclusions—based for the first time on solid, empirical evidence—that flew in the face of what many Bitcoin users believed at the time: Far from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\n“Even our relatively small experiment demonstrates that this approach can shed considerable light on the structure of the Bitcoin economy, how it is used, and those organizations who are party to it,” the paper read. “We demonstrate that an agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the public nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary flows to major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.”\nHaving set down those words, and blowing a gaping hole in the myth of Bitcoin’s inherent untraceability, Meiklejohn, Savage, and her other adviser Geoffrey Voelker started brainstorming a clever title. In an homage to the Wild West of the economy they were chronicling—and her advisers’ mutual love of spaghetti Westerns—they started with the phrase “A Fistful of Bitcoins,” an allusion to the 1960s Clint Eastwood classic A Fistful of Dollars. They settled on a subtitle that evoked both Eastwood’s most famous cowboy vigilante and the world of shadowy figures their nascent techniques could unmask. When the UCSD paper hit the internet in August 2013, it was introduced with a description that, to those involved, had come to seem inevitable: “A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.”\nIn the new era of cryptocurrency tracing that would follow Meiklejohn’s work, they wouldn’t remain nameless for long.\nAdapted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency.

And yet, it still faces the risk of losing vast amounts of customers\u0027 sensitive medical data.\nIn a statement sent to WIRED and other news outlets on Monday evening, Change Healthcare wrote that it paid a ransom to a cybercriminal group extorting the company, a hacker gang known as AlphV or BlackCat. “A ransom was paid as part of the company’s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from disclosure,” the statement reads. The company\u0027s belated admission of that payment accompanied a new post on its website where it warns that the hackers may have stolen health-related data that would “cover a substantial proportion of people in America.”\nChange Healthcare\u0027s statement didn\u0027t state the size of the ransom payment. In a hearing held by the US Senate\u0027s Finance Committee on May 1, however, Andrew Witty, CEO of Change Healthcare parent company UnitedHealth Group, confirmed that the payment was $22 million.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Cybersecurity and cryptocurrency researchers told WIRED last month that Change Healthcare appeared to have paid that ransom on March 1, pointing to a transaction of 350 bitcoins or roughly $22 million sent into a crypto wallet associated with the AlphV hackers. That transaction was first highlighted in a message on a Russian cybercriminal forum known as RAMP, where one of AlphV\u0027s allegedly jilted partners complained that they hadn\u0027t received their cut of Change Healthcare\u0027s payment. However, for weeks following that transaction, which was publicly visible on Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain and which both security firm Recorded Future and blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs told WIRED had been received by AlphV, Change Healthcare repeatedly declined to confirm that it had paid the ransom.\nChange Healthcare\u0027s confirmation of that extortion payment puts new weight behind the cybersecurity industry\u0027s fears that the attack—and the profit AlphV extracted from it—will lead ransomware gangs to further target health care companies. “It 100 percent encourages other actors to target health care organizations,” Jon DiMaggio, a researcher with cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who focuses on ransomware, told WIRED at the time the transaction was first spotted in March. “And it’s one of the industries we don’t want ransomware actors to target—especially when it affects hospitals.”\nCompounding the situation, a conflict between hackers in the ransomware ecosystem has led to a second ransomware group claiming to possess Change Healthcare\u0027s stolen data and threatening to sell it to the highest bidder on the dark web. Earlier this month that second group, known as RansomHub, sent WIRED alleged samples of the stolen data that appeared to come from Change Healthcare\u0027s network, including patient records and a contract with another health care company.As of Monday, strangely, the listing for that data on RansomHub\u0027s dark-web site had been taken down. Change Healthcare\u0027s post to its website, however, warns that 22 screenshots of its data had been posted to the dark web by an unnamed hacker group, and that they included “protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII),” though it said it hadn\u0027t seen any sign that medical records like doctor\u0027s charts or full medical histories for any patients were among the stolen data.\nFor Change Healthcare and the beleaguered medical practices, hospitals, and patients that depend on it, the confirmation of its extortion payment to the hackers adds a bitter coda to an already dystopian story. AlphV\u0027s digital paralysis of Change Healthcare snarled the insurance approval of prescriptions and medical procedures for hundreds of medical practices and hospitals across the country, making it by some measures the most widespread medical ransomware disruption ever. A survey of American Medical Association members conducted between March 26 and April 3 found that four out of five clinicians had lost revenue as a result of the crisis. Many said they were using their own personal finances to cover a practice’s expenses. Change Healthcare, meanwhile, says it has lost $872 million to the incident and projects that number to rise well over a billion in the longer term.\nChange Healthcare\u0027s confirmation of its ransom payment now appears to show that much of that catastrophic fallout for the US health care system unfolded after it had already paid the hackers an exorbitant sum—a payment in exchange for a decryption key for the systems the hackers had encrypted and a promise not to leak the company\u0027s stolen data. As is often the case in ransomware attacks, AlphV\u0027s disruption of its systems appears to have been so widespread that Change Healthcare\u0027s recovery process has extended long after it obtained the decryption key designed to unlock its systems.\nAs ransomware payments go, $22 million isn\u0027t the most that a victim has forked over. But it\u0027s close, says Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused security researcher who spoke to WIRED about the suspected payment in March. Only a few rare payments, such as the $40 million paid to hackers by CNA Financial in 2021, top that number. “It’s not without precedent, but it’s certainly very unusual,” Callow said of the $22 million figure.\nThat $22 million injection of funds into the ransomware ecosystem further fuels a vicious cycle that has reached epidemic proportions. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis found that in 2023, ransomware victims paid the hackers targeting them fully $1.1 billion, a new record. Change Healthcare\u0027s payment may represent only a small drop in that bucket, but it both rewards AlphV for its highly damaging attacks and may suggest to other ransomware groups that health care companies are particularly profitable targets, given those companies are especially sensitive to both the high cost of those cyberattacks financially and the risks they pose to patients\u0027 health.\nCompounding Change Healthcare\u0027s mess is an apparent double-cross within the ransomware underground: AlphV, by all appearances, faked its own law enforcement takedown after receiving Change Healthcare\u0027s payment in an attempt to avoid sharing it with its so-called affiliates, the hackers who partner with the group to penetrate victims on its behalf. The second ransomware group threatening Change Healthcare, RansomHub, now claims to WIRED that they obtained the stolen data from those affiliates, who still want to be paid for their work.\nThat has created a situation where Change Healthcare\u0027s payment provides little assurance that its compromised data won\u0027t still be exploited by disgruntled hackers. “These affiliates work for multiple groups. They’re concerned with getting paid themselves, and there’s no trust among thieves,” Analyst1\u0027s DiMaggio told WIRED in March. “If someone screws someone else, you don’t know what they’re going to do with the data.”\nAll of that means Change Healthcare still has little assurance that it has avoided an even worse scenario than it has yet faced: paying what may be one of the biggest ransoms in history and still seeing its data spilled onto the dark web. “If it gets leaked after they paid $22 million, it’s pretty much like setting that money on fire,” DiMaggio warned in March. “They’d have burned that money for nothing.”\nUpdated 10:25 am ET, May 1, 2024: UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty confirmed to a US Senate committee that the company paid $22 million in ransom.","tags":["","RANSOMWARE","HACKING","CYBERSECURITY","MALWARE","HEALTHCARE"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2024-04-22"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-hack-400-million-crypto-laundering/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Whoever looted FTX on the day of its bankruptcy has now moved the stolen money through a long string of intermediaries—and eventually some that look Russian in origin.","title":"New Clues Suggest Stolen FTX Funds Went to Russia-Linked Money Launderers","detailed_content":"AS THE CRIMINAL trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried unfolds in a Manhattan courtroom, some observers in the cryptocurrency world have been watching a different FTX-related crime in progress: The still-unidentified thieves who stole more than $400 million out of FTX on the same day that the exchange declared bankruptcy have, after nine months of silence, been busy moving those funds across blockchains in an apparent attempt to cash out their loot while covering their tracks. Blockchain watchers still hope that money trail might help to identify the perpetrator of the heist—and according to one crypto-tracing firm, some clues now suggest that those thieves may have ties to Russia.\nToday, cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic released a new report on the complex path those stolen funds have taken over the 11 months since they were pulled out of FTX on November 11 of last year. Elliptic\u0027s tracing shows how that nine-figure sum, which FTX puts at between $415 million and $432 million, has since moved through a long list of crypto services as the thieves attempt to prepare it for laundering and liquidation, and even through one service owned by FTX itself. But those hundreds of millions also sat idle for all of 2023—only to begin to move again this month, in some cases as Bankman-Fried himself sat in court. \nMost tellingly, Elliptic\u0027s analysis is the first to note that whoever is laundering the stolen FTX funds appears to have ties to Russian cybercrime. One $8 million tranche of the money ended up in a pool of funds that also includes cryptocurrency from Russia-linked ransomware hackers and dark web markets. That commingling of funds suggests that, whether or not the actual thieves are Russian, the money launderers who received the stolen FTX\u0027s funds are likely Russian, or work with Russian cybercriminals. \n“It’s looking increasingly likely that the perpetrator has links to Russia,” says Elliptic\u0027s chief scientist and cofounder Tom Robison. “We can’t attribute this to a Russian actor, but it’s an indication it might be.”\nSign Up Today\nKeep up-to-date with the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried by signing up for our Daily newsletter.\nFrom the first days of its money laundering process following the theft, Elliptic says the FTX thieves have largely taken steps typical for the perpetrators of large-scale crypto heists as the culprits sought to secure the funds, swap them for more easily laundered coins, and then funnel them through cryptocurrency \"mixing\" services to achieve that laundering. The majority of the stolen funds, Elliptic says, were stablecoins that, unlike other forms of cryptocurrency, can be frozen by their issuer in the case of theft. In fact, the stablecoin issuer Tether moved quickly to freeze $31 million of the stolen money in response to the FTX heist. So the thieves immediately began exchanging the rest of those stablecoins for other crypto tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap—which don\u0027t have the know-your-customer requirements that centralized exchanges do, in part because they don\u0027t allow exchanges for fiat currency.\nIn the days that followed, Elliptic says, the thieves began a multi-step process to convert the tokens they\u0027d traded the stablecoins for into cryptocurrencies that would be easier to launder. They used “cross-chain bridge” services that allow cryptocurrencies to be exchanged from one blockchain to another, trading their tokens on the bridges Multichain and Wormhole to convert them to Ethereum. By the third day after the theft, the thieves held a single Ethereum account worth $306 million, down about $100 million from their initial total due to the Tether seizure and the cost of their trades.\nFrom there, the thieves appear to have focused on exchanging their Ethereum for Bitcoin, which is often easier to feed into \"mixing\" services that offer to blend a user\u0027s bitcoins with those of other users to prevent blockchain-based tracing. On November 20, nine days after the theft, they traded about a quarter of their Ethereum holdings for Bitcoin on a bridge service called RenBridge—a service that was, ironically, itself owned by FTX. “Yes, it is quite amazing, really, that the proceeds of a hack were basically being laundered through a service owned by the victim of the hack,” says Elliptic\u0027s Robison.On December 12, a month after the theft, most of the bitcoins from that RenBridge trade were then fed into a mixing service called ChipMixer. Like most mixing services, the now-defunct ChipMixer offered to take in user funds and return the same amount, minus a commission, from other sources, in theory muddling the money\u0027s trail on the blockchain. But Elliptic says it was nonetheless able to trace $8 million worth of the money to a pool of funds that also included the proceeds from Russia-linked ransomware and dark web markets, which was then sent to various exchanges to be cashed out. \n “There might have been a handoff from a thief to a launderer,” says Robison. “But even if that was the case, it would mean the thief was in contact with someone who is part of a Russian money laundering operation.” Robison adds that Elliptic has other intelligence pointing to the money launderers\u0027 Russian ties, but doesn\u0027t yet have permission from the source to make it public.\nAfter their initial attempt to launder a portion of the funds through ChipMixer, the thieves went strangely quiet. The rest of their Ethereum would remain dormant for the next nine months.\nOnly on September 30, just days ahead of Bankman-Fried\u0027s trial, did the remainder of the funds begin to move again, Elliptic says. By that time, both RenBridge and ChipMixer had been shut down—RenBridge due to its parent company FTX\u0027s collapse and ChipMixer due to a law enforcement seizure. So the thieves pivoted to trading their Ethereum for Bitcoin on a service called THORSwap and then routing those bitcoins into a mixing service called Sinbad.\nSinbad has over the past year become a popular destination for criminal cryptocurrency, particularly crypto stolen by North Korean hackers. But Elliptic\u0027s Robison notes that despite this, the movement of funds appears less sophisticated than what he\u0027s seen in the typical North Korean heist. “It doesn\u0027t use some of the services that Lazarus typically use,” Robison says, referring to the broad group of North Korean state-sponsored hackers known as Lazarus. “So it doesn\u0027t look like them.” Robison notes that Sinbad is likely a rebranding of a mixing service called Blender that was hit with US sanctions last year, in part for helping to launder funds from Russian ransomware groups. Sinbad also offers customer support in English and Russian.\nDoes the timing of those new movements of funds ahead of—and even during—Bankman-Fried\u0027s trial suggest someone with insider knowledge is involved? Elliptic\u0027s Robison notes that, while the timing is conspicuous, he can only speculate at this point. It\u0027s possible that the timing has been purely coincidental, Robison says. Or someone might be moving the money now to make it look like an FTX insider—potentially one who fears they might be about to lose their internet access. Neither Bankman-Fried nor his fellow executives have been charged with the theft, and some of the money movements have taken place while Bankman-Fried has been in court, with only a laptop disconnected from the internet.Eventually, no doubt, the thieves will attempt to cash out more of their stolen and laundered cryptocurrency for some sort of fiat currency. Robison is still hopeful that, despite their use of mixers, they can be further identified at that point. “I think they probably will be successful in cashing out at least some of these funds. I think whether they\u0027re going to get away with it is a separate question,” says Robison. “There\u0027s already a blockchain trail to be followed, and I think that trail will only become clearer with time.”\nTwo other cryptocurrency tracing firms, TRM Labs and Chainalysis, have both been hired by FTX\u0027s new regime under CEO John Ray III to aid in the investigation. TRM Labs declined to comment on the case. Chainalysis didn’t respond to WIRED’s request for comment, nor did FTX itself.\nAs those cryptocurrency tracers continue to follow the money, we may someday have a clearer answer to the mystery of the FTX heist. In the meantime, however, FTX\u0027s many aggrieved creditors will be left to keep one eye on Bankman-Fried\u0027s trial and the other on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nUpdated at 8:45 am ET, October 12, 2023, to add that Elliptic researchers found links to Russian cybercriminals.","tags":["","FTX TRIAL","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRIME","HACKING"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2023-10-12"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/idris-elba-crypto-stellar-development-foundation/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"During the crypto gold rush, Idris Elba says he turned down a lot of “mad opportunities.” Now he has partnered with the “crypto-for-good” Stellar Development Foundation.","title":"Idris Elba Is Ready to Talk About Crypto","detailed_content":"IDRIS ELBA LEARNED about crypto at the same time as almost everyone else: when prices went through the roof.

Those numbers far outstrip stablecoins\u0027 growing overall use—including for legitimate purposes—which accounted for 59 percent of all cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2023.\nIn total, Chainalysis measured $40 billion in illicit stablecoin transactions in 2022 and 2023 combined. The largest single category of that stablecoin-enabled crime was sanctions evasion. In fact, across all cryptocurrencies, sanctions evasion accounted for more than half of the $24.2 billion in criminal transactions Chainalysis observed in 2023, with stablecoins representing the vast majority of those transactions.\nThe attraction of stablecoins for both sanctioned people and countries, argues Andrew Fierman, Chainalysis\u0027 head of sanctions strategy, is that it allows targets of sanctions to circumvent any attempt to deny them a stable currency like the US dollar. “Whether it\u0027s an individual located in Iran or a bad guy trying to launder money—either way, there\u0027s a benefit to the stability of the US dollar that people are looking to obtain,” Fierman says. “If you\u0027re in a jurisdiction where you don\u0027t have access to the US dollar due to sanctions, stablecoins become an interesting play.”\nAs examples, Fierman points to Nobitex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange operating in the sanctioned country of Iran, as well as Garantex, a notorious exchange based in Russia that has been specifically sanctioned for its widespread criminal use. Stablecoin usage on Nobitex outstrips bitcoin by a 9:1 ratio, and on Garantex by a 5:1 ratio, Chainalysis found. That\u0027s a stark difference from the roughly 1:1 ratio between stablecoins and bitcoins on a few nonsanctioned mainstream exchanges that Chainalysis checked for comparison.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChainalysis\u0027s chart showing the growth in stablecoins as a fraction of the value of total illicit crypto transactions over time.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINALYSISChainalysis concedes that the analysis in its report excludes some cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash that are designed to be harder or impossible to trace with blockchain analysis. It also says it based its numbers on the type of cryptocurrency sent directly to an illicit actor, which may leave out other currencies used in money laundering processes that repeatedly swap one type of cryptocurrency for another to make tracing more difficult.\nChainalysis\u0027s findings come on the heels of another report released earlier this week by United Nations researchers on the outsize role of stablecoins in illegal gambling and scam operations across East and Southeast Asia. While Chainalysis declined to break out the value of any particular stablecoin in its findings, the UN report singles out Tether, the most popular stablecoin. The report describes Tether sent through the TRON blockchain-based payment network as the “preferred choice for regional cyberfraud operations and money launderers alike due to its stability and the ease, anonymity, and low fees of its transactions.”\n“Pig butchering” scams—cons in which scammers typically trick users into sending funds into fraudulent investments—consistently use Tether as the means of bilking victims, says Erin West, a deputy district attorney for California\u0027s Santa Clara County and a member of the REACT High Tech Task Force, who has long focused on crypto crime. “It’s always, always, always Tether. I’ve never heard of pig butchering that isn’t Tether,” says West. “These scammers can’t risk the volatility of any of the other coins like bitcoin or ether. All they want is to move assets from the victims\u0027 hands to their own in the cheapest, easiest way possible.”\nWest says that the high proportion of stablecoin use in sanctions evasion also represents a disturbing trend, given that it undermines a system meant to hold specific countries, individuals, and companies accountable for criminal behavior and violations of international law. “It\u0027s so dangerous,” West says. “It enables them to have access to the very units of currency that we’re trying to prevent them from accessing. This is exactly what sanctions are meant to stop, and they’re able to bypass it.”\nChainalysis\u0027s chart showing how stablecoins dominated cryptocurrency-based sanctions evasion and scams in 2023.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINALYSISWhen WIRED reached out to Tether Holdings—the company that issues the stablecoin that shares its name—it responded in a statement following publication of this article that “Tether proactively collaborates with global law enforcement agencies to identify and prevent illicit use of” its cryptocurrency, adding that its “commitment to the highest standards of compliance is evident in our efforts to eliminate various forms of criminal activity.”\nTether argued further that it has contributed to freezing the assets of users involved in scams or found to be violating the US Treasury\u0027s sanctions lists, and noted that all of its transactions, like many cryptocurrencies, can be publicly observed on blockchains—in other words, the observability that made Chainalysis\u0027s report possible. “Between our active and direct engagement with law enforcement and leveraging the transparent nature of blockchain transactions, individuals attempting to conceal their illicit financial activities face significant risks, as every transaction can be easily traced,” the company\u0027s statement reads.\nTether Holdings has more flatly denied other reports of Tether\u0027s use in crime and sanctions evasion. It wrote that an October Wall Street Journal article on the subject was based on “highly erroneous interpretations of data”—though in that case, the company pointed to Chainalysis findings as a more accurate accounting. “There is simply no evidence that Tether has violated Sanctions laws or the Bank Secrecy Act through inadequate customer due diligence or screening practices,” Tether Holdings wrote in an October 26 blog post addressing the WSJ article.\nIn contrast to most cryptocurrencies, Tether does have the capability to freeze user funds, and it said in the October blog post that since its launch in 2014, it had frozen $835 million in funds deemed to be tied to illicit activities. “Tether\u0027s ethos revolves around transparency, compliance, and proactive collaboration with relevant authorities worldwide,” the company wrote.\nChainalysis\u0027 Fierman says that Tether\u0027s efforts to freeze criminal funds are having an impact, and more enforcement could help end stablecoins\u0027 exploitation by criminals. “Just as we’ve seen with compliant exchanges dominating more and more of total transaction volumes, illicit activity gets pushed to the fringes,” Fierman says.\nDespite Tether\u0027s ability to freeze funds, Chainalysis\u0027 data suggests that illicit use of stablecoins has so far dwarfed those seizures. West, the prosecutor, notes that most Tether associated with crime is cashed out for another currency long before anyone identifies it. That means Tether hasn\u0027t yet come close to solving the underlying problem.\n“I applaud it. I\u0027m all for it,” West says of Tether\u0027s efforts to freeze criminal assets. “But when we\u0027re talking about billions and billions of dollars in assets moving, I just think this is one piece of one piece of the puzzle. There are so many more pieces. And the bad actors are so far ahead of us.”\nUpdated at 9:45 am ET, January 18, 2024, to correctly identify prosecutor Erin West\u0027s professional title and at 2:45 pm ET with a statement from Tether Holdings.","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRIME","RUSSIA","IRAN"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2024-01-18"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/what-can-crypto-still-do-for-black-people/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"For some people of color, crypto isn’t in crisis.

The unofficial fifth C is certification—paperwork from an independent authority validating the qualities and authenticity of a stone. Now, however, a UK startup is aiming to bring yet another C into the mix: code.\nOpsydia, a company spun out in 2017 from research conducted at the University of Oxford, is pioneering the laser inscription of near-invisible identifier codes—what it calls “nano-IDs”—inside diamonds.\nEach nano-ID consists of a series of submicron-size dots that are imprinted a fifth of a millimeter beneath the gem’s surface, the dots forming a numerical code that’s linked to official certification documents or (increasingly) blockchain ledgers.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nCrucially, such an identifier doesn’t come close to registering as the kind of mark that would impact a stone’s quality. Magnification of at least 200X and specifically designed illumination is needed just to spot these subsurface codes. For comparison, specialists in diamond grading laboratories work with between 40X and 80X magnification; a jeweler’s loupe offers considerably less.\n“Because the dots are under 1 micron in all dimensions, it’s actually incredibly difficult to characterize the kind of physical change that’s there—it’s close to doing nothing at all,” says Lewis Fish, Opsydia’s head of product, pointing to a 5-mm diamond inscribed with a nano-ID. “We sent that for checking to one of the leading grading laboratories, and they knew the code was there—but they couldn’t find it.”\nUsing lasers to inscribe tiny codes and even logos onto diamonds is not in itself new. Usually placed on the stone’s girdle (a narrow band at the outer perimeter, dividing upper and lower sections), these have been on offer from grading labs and other providers since the 1980s. But the codes’ surface positioning is also their weakness: They can be polished off. Also, once set in a piece of jewelry they may be obscured.\nThe proliferation of laser technology, meanwhile, means that bad actors can inscribe either fake codes—for instance, assigning a serial number wrongly designating a higher quality of stone, or indeed labeling a lab-grown diamond as natural—or counterfeit versions of the logos of official laboratories and institutions.\nDynamite With a Laser Beam\nEach Opsydia nano-ID consists of a series of submicron-sized dots imprinted a fifth of a millimeter beneath the gem’s surface.\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nBy contrast, because Opsydia’s technology—which is packaged up in a piano-size machine supplied to industry players such as jewelry brands, manufacturers, and grading labs at a cost of £400,000 ($524,000)—places the inscription beneath the surface, it is supposedly out of reach of the scammers.The code-writing laser beam itself is focused to extreme precision, using patented technology that Opsydia says is unique worldwide in its capabilities. That means it can overcome the exceptionally high refractive index of diamond: The beam effectively behaves as though the diamond, which would normally send a light wave flying off in myriad directions, isn’t there at all.\nWith laser pulses lasting less than a trillionth of a second, there’s apparently no heat damage. And the near invisibility of the mark means that rather than being hidden in a discreet part of the diamond, it can sit centrally, right under the top of the stone.\n“If you wanted to remove it, you’d have to recut the stone and lose a huge amount of the value,” says Andrew Rimmer, Opsydia’s CEO. That’s because reducing the top of a diamond, even by the shallow amount needed to cut out the nano-ID, would generally require recutting other facets to maintain proportionality.\nAnd while the firm trains its customers’ technicians to use its machines and program in the codes themselves, any logos or other IP can only be uploaded by Opsydia itself. “Software encryption means we control that,” says Rimmer. “We’ve set out right from the beginning to have a secure solution.”\nTransparency and traceability have become especially hot topics in the jewelry industry and the wider luxury sector, as demand for goods that are ethically sourced and verifiable has increased sharply. “Issues at the turn of the century such as blood diamonds and conflict gold created awareness that greater transparency was needed in diamond and gem supply chains,” says Laurent Cartier, head of special initiatives at the Swiss Gemmological Institute and a lecturer at the University of Lausanne.\n“Today the main drivers are regulations from governments, the banking sector, and OECD guidelines, and the growing demands of consumers to know more about where and how the gems in their jewelry were sourced.”\nTo that end, technological solutions that can help analyze, verify, and identify diamonds and gemstones are being increasingly explored. Earlier this year, for instance, the Swiss company Spacecode announced a device it says can chemically analyze the makeup of a particular diamond and identify its place of origin, while others are also investigating the notion that each diamond has a unique chemical and morphological “fingerprint” that can identify it.\nCartier warns against assumptions that technology alone can solve all such issues, “but it is a very important part of the traceability puzzle,” he says. Opsydia’s subsurface tech, he says, “adds an extra layer of security and is a promising approach for high-value diamonds and gemstones.”\nIn particular, Rimmer says Opsydia’s nano-IDs can bring added certainty to the kinds of blockchain platforms that have emerged in recent years to support traceability and authentication in the luxury and jewelry sectors. Examples include the Aura platform developed with Microsoft by LVMH, Cartier, and Prada, and Tracr, launched by the world’s largest diamond producer, De Beers.\nHowever, as Cartier points out, such platforms are only as good as the quality of the data going into them: Knowing the origin of a diamond only tells you so much. “There may be a paper trail and audits that confirm it comes from a specific mine and a particular set of standards were followed,” he says. “Technology can be useful in carrying that information all the way through the supply chain in transparent and verifiable ways.” But a paper trail could be assigned to the wrong gem.That, says Rimmer, is where Opsydia comes in. “Blockchain is a way of storing information securely, but you need to make sure it’s linked to the physical stone or piece of jewelry.” So as well as inscribing a serial number that goes into the blockchain, Opsydia’s machines can take a photograph of the inscription that can also be stored in the ledger. As another safeguard, the company has developed a light-box viewing system to demonstrate the inscription in jewelry showrooms.\nRimmer adds that a single Opsydia machine can process around 100,000 stones a year (each one takes around 10 seconds). He’s targeting both profitability for Opsydia, which closed its third funding round last summer, and the processing of 10 million stones annually across the company’s machines, by 2025.\nShaping Space Lasers\nEach Opsydia machine can process around 100,000 stones a year (each one takes around 10 seconds).\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nBut it wasn’t out of a wish to solve diamond traceability that Opsydia’s technology was developed. Rather, it emerged as part of wider research into areas including adaptive optics for space telescopes and the precise shaping of laser beams, conducted at Oxford University’s Department for Engineering Science.\nOpsydia was set up in 2017 through Oxford University Innovation, the company that manages IP licensing and spin-offs from the institution’s research work, to commercialize the research team’s technology. The first laser machines were delivered in 2020, with De Beers’ lab diamond arm, Lightbox Jewelery, among the early takers. As well as diamonds, the laser inscriptions can also be applied to any gemstone.\n“When we started, there were a few conversations ongoing around traceability, but now it is the number one conversation in the jewelry industry,” says Rimmer. “So the real pull is coming from the brands who want to be able to tell this story as part of their promise to consumers, because that’s what they’re asking for.”\nThe war in Ukraine and consequent difficulties in stemming the flow of diamonds from Russia, among the world’s largest producers, into Western markets, have served to highlight the complexity and opaqueness of gemstone supply chains globally, and the need for new ways to tackle this.Opsydia’s technology can only be applied at the stage of a stone being polished and cut, though the company is “looking at the feasibility of doing something at the ‘rough’ stage,” says Rimmer, suggesting that raw, uncut diamonds could one day be laser-inscribed at source. That, however, is apparently some way off. “We’re not there yet, but we’re investigating,” he says.\nQuantum Leap\nThe laser tech has potential to create atomic-scale defects in the diamond lattice where two carbon atoms are replaced by a nitrogen atom and an empty space. Such chambers have remarkable quantum properties.\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nAway from the glittering world of gemstones, Opsydia’s advances in applying precisely controlled lasers to diamond structures are also presenting opportunities in new industrial fields. “We’re able to write electrical circuits inside a diamond wafer,” says Rimmer. This brings into play the emerging world of diamond-based electronic devices, with multiple potential applications—including perhaps the greatest prize: quantum computing.\nIn essence, the laser can be tuned to transform localized parts of a diamond\u0027s carbon lattice (the arrangement of atoms in a diamond crystal) into graphitic structures that conduct electricity—micro-scale, 3D electronic circuits. Such devices are used in particle accelerators at CERN, for instance, in high-energy particle detection applications where other materials degrade quickly.\nRimmer says there are other potential uses in electrochemistry, instrumentation, and radiation detection. “The big benefit that diamond has over silicon and other materials is that it’s not damaged by radiation.”\nBut there may be even greater potential in using the laser to create nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in the diamond lattice: invisible, atomic-scale defects where two carbon atoms are replaced by a nitrogen atom and an empty space.\nNV centers have remarkable quantum properties, including ultra-sensitive magnetic field detection and the ability to emit and manipulate light at the single photon level. That makes them effective as controllable and measurable quantum systems.\n“An NV center can operate as a qubit, which means that diamond is one of the candidate materials for quantum processing,” says Rimmer. While that’s the end goal, nearer-term applications around ultra-fine magnetic sensing and instrumentation—for magnetic ground surveys, for instance, or GPS communication—are also in play.\nAll of that remains at the university research stage for now. Nevertheless, for Opsydia’s investors, diamond traceability may just be the tip of a very sparkly iceberg.","tags":["","QUANTUM COMPUTING","LUXURY"],"author":"BY TIM BARBER","creation_date":"2023-11-27"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/four-key-investment-areas-for-business-leaders/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Research by EY regularly identifies the need for keeping people at the heart of technology-enabled change.","title":"Unlock greater value from your transformation investment","detailed_content":"HOW CAN BUSINESSES keep their technology from becoming stagnant? That’s the question facing senior leaders across the UK who hope to keep pace with technology innovation and retain their organisations’ competitive advantage.\nIt’s no secret that technology moves quickly, and keeping ahead of the curve can be challenging. But trying to predict the future, and where the world of business is headed can often be futile- however, that doesn’t mean companies don’t try.\nBusinesses will routinely invest huge amounts of time, effort and resource on horizon scanning-often with limited success. Horizon scanning, company monitoring and other tools are all the focus of investment budgets, but can only provide so much information. They’re often lagging indicators, telling businesses what things were like in the recent past. They’re also anonymous, detached data points that don’t always link to the unique pressures individual businesses face or provide actionable insight into how things can be changed.\nWhilst senior leaders can sometimes find reassurance in research investment, more often than not, transformative insights can be found from within the company, and derived from the people who keep it turning- your workforce.\n“In a race to induct the most cutting-edge technology, some business leaders can fall into the well-trodden trap of prioritising the technology, and then perceived need for it, over their people, and their actual need for it,” Benoit Laclau, consulting managing partner for the UK and Ireland at EY.\n“We often ask our clients: ‘Are you reframing the future, or is the future reframing you,’” says Laclau. The question is designed to prompt thinking about hoped for growth aspirations against the backdrop of the changing market- and whether the company is leading the way, or being led by change. Establishing that core principle- of what investment is needed where, at what level, to best benefit the business- is done through collaboration with stakeholders across an organisation, including customers, employees and citizens. By putting stakeholders at the heart of transformation projects, EY teams are better able to establish which investment areas should. be prioritized and for what purpose.\nItalian news organisation Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA) approached EY teams with a complex problem: they needed support to help provide transparency in the origin of the news they were reporting. Staggeringly, falsehoods are 70 percent more likely to be retweeted on social media than the truth, according to research by MIT Media Lab, which can undermine the reputation that news agencies such as ANSA are keen to preserve.\nTo see how ANSA’s news stories spread across the internet, EY teams implemented a blockchain based solution; when an editor publishes a news story it’s fed into the system automatically, with its ID and publication details in a block that is made immutable through notarisation on the blockchain. When these stories are published online, they are given an “ANSACheck” sticker that readers can click on to see who has written and potentially republished them. ANSACheck enables readers to confirm that news origins are true and trusted, and drives a deeper understanding of the news process – which is particularly relevant if a story is controversial.ANSACheck came into its own during the Covid-19 pandemic, when disinformation thrived and many readers asked about the origin of some stories that mentioned ANSA as a source. ANSA was able, through ANSACheck, to confirm that the source of the stories was not authentic. It combined the best of both worlds: a data-driven, human-centric approach can help affect meaningful change.\n“Investment for investment’s sake isn’t worth it,” says Laclau. “It needs to have a purpose for leaders to see a return on their investment. In the Tech Horizons survey conducted by EY teams, 71 per cent of respondents ranked talent and culture in the top three success factors for transformation. Businesses that exceed expectations combine people and technology to grow their business faster. It is rarely the case that technology alone helps businesses to innovate- successful transformation relies on designing technology around user needs and putting people at the heart of change, as ANSA did.”\nBut delivering on the promise of human-centric transformation is often easier said than done. EY teams are brought in to help initiate and deliver change within businesses with whom they work to avoid falling into the trap of rolling out a technology that doesn\u0027t meet needs of the business or its stakeholders.\nTo discover how ANSA used blockchain technologies to restore trust in news and deliver a people-centric transformation, read the full case study, then see how EY teams can help you.\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","tags":[""],"creation_date":"2023-09-11"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/us-treasury-crypto-mixer-hamas/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"With a new emphasis on the Hamas attacks on Israel, the US Treasury has proposed designating foreign cryptocurrency “mixer” services as money launderers and national security threats.","title":"Citing Hamas, the US Wants to Treat Crypto Anonymity Services as Suspected Money Launderers","detailed_content":"HAMAS’ ATTACKS AGAINST Israel on October 7 have shifted the geopolitical landscape and triggered a looming Israeli ground assault in the Gaza Strip. Now the ripple effects are reaching the cryptocurrency industry, where they’ve become the United States Department of the Treasury’s rallying cry for a crackdown on cryptocurrency anonymity services.\nThe US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today released a set of proposed rules that would designate foreign cryptocurrency “mixers”—services that blend users’ digital funds to offer more anonymity and make them harder to trace—as money laundering tools that pose a threat to national security and would thus face new sanctions and regulations. The new rules, if adopted following a 90-day period of public comment and debate, would potentially represent the broadest restrictions imposed yet on the mixing services and could make it far harder for cryptocurrency holders to put their money through the services before cashing it out at a US cryptocurrency exchange, or even at a foreign exchange that accepts US customers.\nWhile the proposed rules were almost certainly in the works long before October 7, the Treasury’s announcement tied the push for a change in policy directly to the use of cryptocurrency by Hamas and militant groups in Gaza. “The Treasury Department is aggressively combatting illicit use of all aspects of the CVC ecosystem by terrorist groups,” Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury, wrote in a statement, using the term “CVC” to mean convertible virtual currency. Adeyemo says that this includes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group that often aligns with Hamas, which Israel blamed for an explosion at a hospital in Gaza earlier this week.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nCryptocurrency mixers have existed almost as long as Bitcoin itself. They offer to take in a user’s cryptocurrency, blend it with that of other users, and return the funds so that they are harder to follow from their origin to destination on blockchains, which generally record every transaction in full public view. The Treasury’s rule change would designate those cryptocurrency-mixing services—or at least the majority of them that are based outside the US—as a “primary money laundering concern.” They would thus be considered a threat to US national security as defined by section 311 of the Patriot Act, a section of the law designed to restrict how domestic financial institutions interact with potential sources of terrorist financing.\nThe rule change would mean that US financial services, as well foreign ones with US customers—including cryptocurrency exchanges—would have to go through extra record-keeping and reporting requirements for funds that have touched a foreign cryptocurrency mixer, and it might even allow the Treasury to block US exchanges from handling those funds. “We’ve never seen anything like this before,” says Ari Redbord, the head of global policy for TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm. Redbord notes that the rule change isn’t proposing a blanket ban on foreign mixing services, only new rules for interacting with them. “The reality, however, is that 311 actions oftentimes have a sort of name-and-shame effect, where people are just not wanting to engage with these platforms out of fear of being caught up in money laundering or other type of illicit activity.”\nRedbord, who previously served as an advisor to the Treasury’s undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, also notes that the proposal was no doubt being considered prior to the latest Hamas attacks and that the Treasury must have changed the proposal’s focus from the use of cryptocurrency by other national security threats, like North Korea and Russia, to Hamas and militant groups in recent days. “Having been at Treasury for a number of years, you don’t just roll out an action like this over the course of 10 days,” says Redbord. “They’ve kind of shifted the narrative toward Hamas because that’s the news.”Hamas and militant groups’ use of cryptocurrency, while significant, pales in comparison to the amount of cryptocurrency used by other illicit actors. Hamas, for instance, raised $41 million in cryptocurrency over the past two years, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad raised $91 million, according to a report last week in the Wall Street Journal that cited analyses by cryptocurrency tracing firms and seizures by the Israeli government.\nIt’s not clear, however, how much of those funds actually made it to these groups before being seized. In fact, Hamas asked its donors to stop using cryptocurrency in April of 2023, due to the public nature of the transactions on blockchains and the risk of prosecution. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis, which frequently works with government and law enforcement customers, went so far as to publish a blog post yesterday cautioning against mistaken analyses that overestimate the role of cryptocurrency in financing entities like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nNorth Korean state-sponsored cybercriminals, Russian ransomware gangs, and other criminal groups, by contrast, have pocketed billions of dollars through their theft of cryptocurrency or use of the technology as a means of demanding extortion payments from victims. Thieves stole $3.8 billion in crypto last year—much of which went to the North Korean regime—and ransomware hackers extorted close to $450 million in just the first half of 2023, according to Chainalysis.\nThose criminals often use cryptocurrency mixing services, funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into services like ChipMixer and Sinbad.io. In fact, US law enforcement and the Treasury Department have aggressively sanctioned or shut down one mixer service after another in recent years, including Blender, TornadoCash, and Bitzlato, often citing their use in laundering the profits of those North Korean and Russian hackers.\nThe new FinCEN rules would be less severe than those sanctions, indictments, and busts—a new regulatory process rather than a ban—but also far wider in scope, says Jason Somensatto, Chainalysis’ head of North America public policy. “The impact can be much broader,” says Somensatto. “They can say that this applies to all mixing services that people are interacting with.”\nAs the Treasury doubles down on its push to cut off crypto-based money laundering—and now points to Hamas as a new impetus for that crackdown—TRM Labs’ Redbord cautions that US regulators shouldn’t go too far in censuring services that do, in some cases, offer financial privacy to legitimate users. After all, without mixers, most cryptocurrency transactions are fully public in nature. “I think the challenge for regulators is, how do we thread the needle between stopping illicit actors from using these platforms but at the same time allow regular users to enable some degree of privacy?” Redbord says. “I think the concern is that this could very much be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.”","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","ISRAEL","ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2023-10-19"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/liberland-crypto-micronation-border-dispute/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"An ultra-libertarian Balkan “country” called Liberland celebrated its eighth anniversary with a boat party and a barbecue, but no one lives there.","title":"A Crypto Micronation’s Future Hangs on a Border Dispute","detailed_content":"LATE ONE MORNING in April, a boat called Liberty sailed down the Danube on a reconnaissance mission, toward a destination found on no map or atlas.

That\u0027s a Morin. Three, two, one. Hi, I\u0027m Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And I\u0027m Gideon Lichfield. And this is Have a Nice Future, a podcast about how terrifyingly fast everything is changing.\nLauren Goode: Each week, we talk to someone with big, audacious, and sometimes unnerving ideas about the future, and we ask them how we can all prepare to live in it.\nGideon Lichfield: Our guest this week is Michael Casey, the chief content officer of CoinDesk, the cryptocurrency news site that almost exactly one year ago brought down Sam Bankman-Fried’s multibillion-dollar crypto empire.Michael Casey (audio clip): What I find extremely frustrating is that the debate is about ‘look how many bad people there are over here; we need to just shut this industry down’ as opposed to thinking hard and intelligently about the technology itself and how we might actually create a safer system so that those bad people don\u0027t take charge of it.\nLauren Goode: Alright Gideon, I\u0027m going to ask the question that\u0027s on a lot of people\u0027s minds: Is crypto dead?\nGideon Lichfield: Dead as in like nobody using it anymore?\nLauren Goode: Well, I mean, obviously people are still using it, but as you mentioned, I think the meltdown of FTX was a real wake-up call for crypto believers. It was so hyped up, and it ended up losing customers and billions of dollars. SBF was the poster boy of crypto, and now he\u0027s on trial for fraud, which we are covering at WIRED. And I feel like pretty much every crypto story I\u0027ve read since then has been about other crypto companies or exchanges struggling because of the ripple effects of that collapse.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. And everyone\u0027s talking about crypto winter for—I dunno, like the fourth or fifth time, and yet as SBF\u0027s trial was starting, the price of bitcoin was up something like 30 percent on what it was right before FTX collapsed, so a lot of people still believe in crypto.\nLauren Goode: Which still doesn\u0027t make sense to me at all.\nGideon Lichfield: And it didn\u0027t to me either, so that\u0027s one of the reasons I wanted to talk to Michael Casey.\nLauren Goode: Did you know that I used to work with Michael Casey at Dow Jones?\nGideon Lichfield: I did not.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I used to. I used to bug him to join me on a livestreaming video show that I was doing at The Wall Street Journal. I had no idea he was a crypto guy or became one.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes, he absolutely still thinks crypto is the future of financial systems, and he\u0027s in this interesting, unique position because CoinDesk is a media company whose very purpose hinges on the existence of crypto and indeed the success of crypto as a technology. But it also did the reporting that took down SBF and caused all this turmoil that we\u0027ve seen in the industry.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, they actually won a big award for that recently. Did you happen to see that?\nGideon Lichfield: Oh, actually I didn\u0027t.\nLauren Goode: They won a Loeb, which is one of the most prestigious awards in business journalism, so kudos to them. But I also saw that CoinDesk was put up for sale.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Was that in any way related to the FTX collapse?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, indeed it was and that\u0027s another part of what makes their situation so interesting. So CoinDesk\u0027s parent company, DCG, owns a bunch of crypto companies and assets, and the fallout of FTX forced it to put a lot of those assets up for sale, including CoinDesk itself. So Michael\u0027s challenge now is how to make CoinDesk a thriving business during this latest crypto winter.Lauren Goode: Ah, so you\u0027re saying the future of journalism is not to put all of your assets in crypto?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, maybe the future of crypto journalism is not to put all your assets in crypto, that\u0027s for sure.\nLauren Goode: OK, fair enough.\nGideon Lichfield: Anyway, I wanted to talk to Michael both to have him explain how he still believes in crypto after everything that\u0027s happened, but also to understand how a news organization that\u0027s covering this industry walks the line between being an advocate for it and also a critic of it.\nLauren Goode: Well, I\u0027m so curious to hear what he has to say.\nGideon Lichfield: And that conversation is coming up right after the break.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Michael Casey, welcome to Have a Nice Future.\nMichael Casey: Thank you for having me, Gideon.\nGideon Lichfield: Are you having a nice future?\nMichael Casey: Ask me tomorrow. I don\u0027t know.\nGideon Lichfield: Ask you in the future?\nMichael Casey In the future.\nGideon Lichfield: OK. Well, we\u0027re speaking because it\u0027s coming up to a year after one of the world\u0027s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, went bankrupt and billions of dollars worth of its customers’ money went missing, and we\u0027re here basically to talk about how the crypto world looks a year after that and how it will look in the future. But I wanna start with you. How did you start covering crypto? What made you interested in it, and what made you believe in it?\nMichael Casey: Yeah, so I was at The Wall Street Journal at the time, and I had covered currencies. I saw this strange thing called bitcoin everyone was talking about. This is in 2013. I was writing a column at the time called “Horizons” for The Wall Street Journal. And I don\u0027t know. I wrote some pretty basic, \"Hey, don\u0027t touch this thing. It\u0027s probably a tulip bubble\" kind of story. And then I got called in by a few people who—some of whom are still in the industry, some who aren\u0027t, some prominent names, some of them big venture capitalists and others, taken out for dinner—explained what it was all about. And I think because of the fact that I\u0027d spent six years of my life in Argentina, a country that just has perpetual crises—it\u0027s just never resolved it\u0027s monetary problems throughout a very long 100-year history of ups and downs—and suddenly this alternative to how a monetary system could run was presented in front of me, something that didn\u0027t need a government, and it just dawned on me as just a phenomenal idea.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, so you saw crypto as a kind of an answer to the brokenness of existing financial systems.\nMichael Casey: And also just a different—just fascinating that you didn\u0027t—you could construct it without an institution in the middle of it. This idea that money didn\u0027t have to be issued by a government, that was just a revelation that just became a never-ending quest to explore.Gideon Lichfield: So you wound up as chief content officer at CoinDesk, which famously published the story last November that brought down FTX, and we\u0027ll talk more about that in a second. But maybe just for our listeners who don\u0027t know, describe really briefly what CoinDesk is.\nMichael Casey: We describe ourselves as the leading media events and indices company in the crypto and digital asset space.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, and so a lot of media companies that cover a particular industry, you have this sort of joint role of being a watchdog for it and also, to an extent, a cheerleader. You are interested in growing and promoting the existence of the industry itself and making it better. Does that seem fair? And I think—\nMichael Casey: I think so. I always flinch a little bit, and I think you as a journalist would do as you hear the word cheerleader. Like, it\u0027s just not something we ever wanna describe ourselves as. I think that it\u0027s pretty hard to be in crypto journalism if you don\u0027t have some belief in the power of the technology. That\u0027s obviously quite different from cheerleading any particular company or even cheerleading the industry as it currently is, right? Like the two things are different.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. The thing that I think is interesting is, any industry media publication has to strike this balance, but it\u0027s an especially delicate balance in an industry like crypto where there are so many scams and grifts. So what are your guiding principles for being honest about what is going on in the industry whilst also fundamentally believing that it\u0027s a worthwhile industry?\nMichael Casey: So many scams. There are a lot, without a doubt. Like I think it would be naive to say that there are not a lot of scams. It is obviously something that we are constantly reporting on. You just have to look at CoinDesk coverage. If you truly believe, as I do, for example, that we have an a fundamentally broken internet with Google, Facebook, and these massive platforms controlling our data and manipulating us via that, and you\u0027d love to see a system that no longer had that dependency, and people had control of their data, then you\u0027re gonna cover this industry for the sake of holding it to account so that it does improve.\nGideon Lichfield: So speaking of that—speaking of holding an industry to account—let\u0027s go back to the day November 2 when CoinDesk published this report on problems at FTX. Maybe just begin by very briefly describing what those problems were for anyone who doesn\u0027t remember.\nMichael Casey: OK. So the first company that now I named—that everybody would be familiar with—Sam Bankman-Fried had created before he created the exchange FTX, was called Alameda Research. Alameda was a trading firm, and there was always known that there was a relationship between the two companies, but we didn\u0027t really have any idea about how deeply intertwined they were until our reporter Ian Allison got ahold of a balance sheet. This is a private company that the balance sheet was not formally released, and this was Alameda\u0027s balance sheet. And it showed that a lot of the assets that it recognized on its books were actually FTT, a token that was issued by FTX. What that showed was this very circular relationship that the assets that this company held were actually completely defined by the institution of which it depended for a lot of business, and essentially it exposed a house of cards and front-running, misuse of customer funds, and an absolutely enormous number of breaches of the fiduciary duty that any exchange has to its users.Gideon Lichfield: Do you think that you could have predicted when FTX first collapsed that it would have so many ripple effects in this way, such a domino effect?\nMichael Casey: We could have. I don\u0027t think we did. I\u0027m not sure many people did. There were certainly people that were looking at the prevalence, and let\u0027s remember that these problems existed in traditional finance as well, right? The intertwined structure of Wall Street was a defining feature of the financial crisis of 2008, but I don\u0027t think anyone really was out there just predicting how dramatically affected everybody would be.\nGideon Lichfield: So overall, how would you say the crypto world looks today in the wake of all of that?\nMichael Casey: So there\u0027s been two phases of what people in this industry describe as the crypto winter. The first is this massive unwind—a load of bankruptcies—then what we\u0027ve seen in each of these winters, a departure of interest in the sector from the kind of retail enthusiasts who were the fly-by-night folks who would come in and out, not sort of long-term investors, but just had gotten excited at the top of the market. And as always, when these things happens, they\u0027re the ones who lose their shirts. When it comes down, those people had disappeared. There was no more—the search queries on Google for “crypto,” for example, have just plummeted. What\u0027s different about this time is it has also come with a very aggressive set of enforcement actions by the US regulatory apparatus, most notably by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC. It\u0027s my belief, others might say otherwise, that the extraordinarily large extent to which my former colleague at MIT, Gary Gensler, has gone to to really attack a lot of firms here—\nGideon Lichfield: This is Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman.\nMichael Casey: That\u0027s right, the chairman of the SEC. It feels very motivated by payback, right, a very large number of lawmakers who had received donations from Sam Bankman-Fried and from FTX. He\u0027d spread his largesse across both sides of the house, and then it turned out that he was just a crook, a—\nGideon Lichfield: Just as bad as the rest, yeah.\nMichael Casey: I would say he was far worse, actually.\nGideon Lichfield: Well, worse than worst of them even.\nMichael Casey: Far, far worse, because it is this idea that you have breached everybody\u0027s trust. You don\u0027t go into Washington and make this sort of a mess without expecting some payback, and it is conceived as a payback against all of crypto, which is pretty unfair, I would say.\nGideon Lichfield: I\u0027m gonna challenge you on that in a bit, because I wanna talk about what the SEC is actually doing. So in June, it sued Binance and Coinbase, which are two of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges. A large part of its lawsuit against both exchanges is that it thinks most crypto assets should be regulated like securities, like stocks and bonds, for example. But then there\u0027s a second issue, and that\u0027s where it\u0027s really suing—where the SEC is suing Binance, which is a bunch of violations for mismanaging its customers funds, which are not unsimilar to some of the charges that were leveled against FTX. So let\u0027s take these two things in.Michael Casey: Or MS Global or HSBC or Standard Chartered or any single bank that has been in this. I\u0027m not trying to shun or forgive them, but those things happen throughout finance, because finance is full of crooks. It always has, always has been. I\u0027ve been covering it for 20 years, and trust me, there are a lot. You could look through a Wikipedia page on something like this, but anyway, carry on.\nGideon Lichfield: Alright. Well, let\u0027s go back to these two separate issues as they relate to crypto. So let\u0027s start with the regulatory question, should most crypto assets be regulated like securities as the SEC is claiming? What\u0027s your position on that?\nMichael Casey: If you just treat every token as a security, it ceases to be able to function for what it does. And so if you created a system that was purely securities, then anybody owning one, anybody who wants to participate—this is supposed to be an open system, it\u0027s supposed to solve things like financial inclusion so that people in the developing world can gain access to payment systems and so forth—every one of those people would have to be an accredited investor. That doesn\u0027t make any sense. You can\u0027t run a decentralized system with that level of bureaucracy in the middle of it.\nGideon Lichfield: OK, so it sounds like you\u0027re basically saying that regulating crypto assets as securities would limit far too much the ability of people to participate in this system and to use it to solve the kinds of financial problems that you think crypto currencies can solve.\nMichael Casey: I\u0027m not at all saying that this shouldn\u0027t be regulated. I\u0027m saying that we need a smart way of trying to deal with this.\nGideon Lichfield: So I think part of the reason that the SEC is trying to enforce these assets or securities is that regardless of what you say should ideally be happening, people aren\u0027t treating them as speculative investments. Like Ethereum I think is up 20 percent for the year. Is there a way to square the circle? Is there a way to have it not become just a speculative asset than—\nMichael Casey: Sure, it\u0027s called consumer finance, it\u0027s called—there\u0027s a whole lot of laws for —what Sam Bankman-Fried did was allegedly illegal. Let\u0027s see how the case that started now plays out. I think many people are pretty convinced that it was. And there\u0027s laws that don\u0027t require necessarily securities laws to do so. Like there\u0027s a breach of a whole host of consumer finance and fiduciary duties. There is all sorts of ways to stop people from doing bad things. Like the risk that an investor faces, which is what you are trying to protect against, comes down to who controls it? Is there a system in which some company, some entity, some person controls your assets? And under a pure decentralized crypto system, you control the assets, not Sam Bankman-Fried. And so there\u0027s a lot out there that would make this a safer system, but it\u0027s really not being contemplated by the current administration.Gideon Lichfield: You said just now that what Sam Bankman-Fried did was allegedly illegal. Is there a world in which it wasn\u0027t illegal?\nMichael Casey: I think we all—I know. I\u0027m trying to be a good journalist here, Gideon. I\u0027m just trying to like—\nGideon Lichfield: Just because he hasn\u0027t been found guilty yet.\nMichael Casey: Innocent before proven guilty, yes, but I think he did.\nGideon Lichfield: Fair enough.\nMichael Casey: That\u0027s it.\nGideon Lichfield: Alright. So, let\u0027s go back to something else that you said, \u0027cause I started talking about how the SEC is also suing Binance over allegedly misusing its customer\u0027s funds, or mismanaging them, and how that was similar to what FTX did, and you jumped in and said, well, also a whole bunch of banks, also large parts of the truth about the financial system.\nMichael Casey: Which sounds like whataboutism maybe, yeah? But—\nGideon Lichfield: It sounds a little bit like whataboutism, but I think more interestingly than that, my question is this, some of the promise—I think, well, the promise of crypto was that it was gonna be decentralized, was that it wasn\u0027t gonna be captured by institutions or by individuals, and yet that is the fact of what has happened, because it turns out that even when you run a decentralized system, you need some things like exchanges or you need trading spaces for NFTs, for example, and those end up being dominated by, on the whole, a handful of parties. So I feel like the problem of corruption or mismanagement that we\u0027ve seen in the crypto industry is to a large extent for that reason. In other words, it doesn\u0027t seem like it is actually immune from the same kind of challenges that face the financial system. So how would you get past that?\nMichael Casey: Well, I think that\u0027s a fair criticism, and I think that that\u0027s on crypto, that\u0027s on this industry for defaulting to the simple solutions.\nGideon Lichfield: Is it on crypto, or is it just on human beings?\nMichael Casey: I think it\u0027s on human beings as well. I think actually it\u0027s very difficult to build the decentralized system. They are inherently complicated, and it\u0027s very, very difficult to do it by snapping your fingers, but bitcoin achieved it. There is nobody in charge of bitcoin and it runs this way day in, day out.\nGideon Lichfield: But there are people in charge of the exchanges when bitcoin is traded.\nMichael Casey: Sure, sure.\nGideon Lichfield: I think that\u0027s my point, is that—\nMichael Casey: No, it is and we can—\nGideon Lichfield: It ends up centralizing somewhere.\nMichael Casey: But there are decentralized exchanges, Gideon. There are, and they function. Some of them, Uniswap for example, has really never had any problems. It works. It\u0027s very complicated for the average person to use. So it\u0027s still on crypto. Crypto needs to develop better UX, be easier systems, et cetera, et cetera. The point I\u0027m just simply making is that it\u0027s possible to build these things, and if there were the right framework within which to do so, I think innovation would go in that direction.Gideon Lichfield: Can you give maybe just one example of a piece of regulation that you think would help make crypto safer?\nMichael Casey: There are laws around the separation of trading operations and investment. A variety of things that are just the norm for now for exchanges in the TradFi world should be applied in crypto, and that would just be one very effective way to, I think, protect investors and consumers from malfeasance.\nGideon Lichfield: Has the past yet changed your own thinking about the future of the crypto industry in any way?\nMichael Casey: It\u0027s made it apparent that we have to figure this out as a political process. There has to be public debate about, there has to be engagement with politicians. We\u0027ve got to figure out a regulatory transition somewhere that enables this in the right way. So I think there\u0027s a—\nGideon Lichfield: What do you think makes that difficult?\nMichael Casey: Oh, it\u0027s lack of education. I think it is characters like Sam Bankman-Fried, who have just shed such a negative light on this industry. So what I find extremely frustrating is that the debate is about, “look how many bad people there are over here; we need to just shut this industry down” as opposed to thinking hard and intelligently about the technology itself and how we might actually create a safer system so that those bad people don\u0027t take charge of it. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s frustrating.\nGideon Lichfield: To me who\u0027s always been something of a crypto skeptic, I think the past year has just reinforced my sense that—\nMichael Casey: I\u0027m sure it has.\nGideon Lichfield: It\u0027s going to be—it\u0027s gonna be confined to a fairly niche group of users, because as you say, there are problems with making it usable and accessible and then difficulties in explaining to people how to regulate it or how to have a sensible conversation about regulation. And it still seems to be beset by volatility and by risk, and by risk of insight and seeding and all of these things.\nMichael Casey: Bitcoin\u0027s been a stable asset around for the last month by the way, but you\u0027re right. In general, you\u0027re right. Yes.\nGideon Lichfield: You\u0027re obviously a still big believer—still a big believer. So what is it that can convince me that I should think differently?\nMichael Casey: I\u0027m a believer in the underlying technology. I\u0027m a believer in the underlying technology. I believe that we—I literally believe we have no choice but to create some sort of decentralized system.\nGideon Lichfield: Why?\nMichael Casey: Well, because, Google. The monopolization of our lives. It\u0027s the idea that our data is controlled by these algorithms, and we\u0027re moving into an AI world in which those centralized entities, profit-motively driven to literally manipulate us with that data, are now going to get even more powerful. So that is what\u0027s at stake here. We can just talk about Sam Bankman-Fried and like whether or not we need a fancy way to play some sort of insurance scam. It\u0027s really about how is the digital economy going to function going forward. We need this thing to be fixed, I\u0027m telling you.Gideon Lichfield: Alright, let\u0027s talk about the future since this is called Have a Nice Future. What do you think crypto looks like in—I don\u0027t know, 10 to 15 years from now?\nMichael Casey: I think it\u0027s going to be normalized through the financial system. I\u0027m not sure that that\u0027s great, by the way. I think you\u0027re going to have a lot of traditional finance actors. If you know, we now—we have BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, all these sort of big institutions, very, very far down the path of developing their own digital asset strategies. They are looking to have ETFs and the like regulated, and I think they\u0027re going to be the big players in this space.\nGideon Lichfield: And that\u0027s bad why?\nMichael Casey: It\u0027s bad if it normalizes the idea that the only way to actually participate in this is through a old 1933 Securities Act, which means that if you are wanting to own or trade bitcoin and you are not an accredited investor or you\u0027re not a big institution, then the only way to own it is through some ETF that is controlled by so and so. You can\u0027t—that idea of monetary freedom that it represents is not possible if this has to be heavily, heavily regulated. I—\nGideon Lichfield: But you\u0027re not against regulation. It sounds like you\u0027re against—\nMichael Casey: No, no, but I\u0027m—\nGideon Lichfield: The old institutions—\nMichael Casey: I have a problem with—\nGideon Lichfield: Getting their fingers in it.\nMichael Casey: Yes. And what I\u0027m trying to say is like by the institutions coming along and validating it, they\u0027re all regulated, right? They\u0027re essentially endorsing the system. The general public is just not going to think about they\u0027re all gonna buy their ETFs and so forth. It\u0027s not going to be the same sort of decentralized system. But look, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the end of the world because I\u0027ve never been a believer that the most valuable thing was everybody owning bitcoin. That\u0027s going to sound like heresy to a lot of Bitcoin Maxis but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it, right? I actually do think that creating decentralized mechanisms for things like data for—again, I go back to the internet. I think those are the most important things. And so what I\u0027m actually most encouraged by, what I would like to think is going to be the most interesting thing happening in the next 10 years, is that self-sovereign identity solutions are going to become the norm.\nGideon Lichfield: So CoinDesk parent company DCG also obviously suffered some fallout from the FTX collapse, and in July, it was announced that CoinDesk is being sold to outside investors. Does that change anything for CoinDesk?\nMichael Casey: Oh, inevitably. A change of ownership does, the new phase. I think DCG has had a very, very tough last year and a half, and it\u0027s difficult when your parent company is going through that. We have a whole host of things that we want to do. We still believe there\u0027s huge growth opportunities. The deal as it\u0027s structured would have a wider variety of investors as part of a consortium and that\u0027s I think a constructive structure for a news organization that is striving to be independent.Gideon Lichfield: Other than the future of CoinDesk, what keeps you up at night?\nMichael Casey: I think we could very well go rapidly into a dystopian world in which humanity is reduced to a bit player in a system run by machines and that the worst of human instincts will now be adopted by machines, which will basically carry out the work. That\u0027s the dystopian path, right? If we get it right and really focus on taking power away from the centralized entities that control these massive data-driven models, and figure out how there\u0027s a collective ownership in that, then of course AI could just be a wonderful driver of a bright future, a better future, that your podcast is looking for everyone to have.\nGideon Lichfield: And so the flip side of that is what keeps you optimistic?\nMichael Casey: I\u0027m going to sound a little hokey, but I actually think that at their core, human beings want to do well by each other. And we need systems that enhance that, that encourage that, that actually are built to protect against the worst instincts that we have and encourage the best ones.\nGideon Lichfield: And it sounds like you think that crypto could be one of those systems even though it hasn\u0027t been—\nMichael Casey: Crypto could be part of it. Again, I\u0027m not going to be this—I\u0027m not the naive “it fixes everything.” This is not a “there\u0027s a blockchain for that solution” kind of guy. I believe in government and regulation and all those things but I think that we need to think hard about where there\u0027s a good intersection between existing systems and certain centralized solutions, government and these decentralized alternatives that brings us to that happier place.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Well, Michael, thank you very much for making the case for believing in crypto in these systems despite all of the events of the last year and few years. So thank you for joining us on Have a Nice Future.\nMichael Casey: Thank you for having me, Gideon.\nLauren Goode: So do you own any crypto?\nGideon Lichfield: I still own no crypto. I do own an NFT of some piece of art that I was given, but no, I\u0027ve never bought or sold a piece of cryptocurrency. What about you?\nLauren Goode: Wait, hold on. You own a piece of an NFT or a piece of art that\u0027s an NFT?\nGideon Lichfield: A piece of art that\u0027s an NFT or rather an NFT—\nLauren Goode: What is that?\nGideon Lichfield: Of a piece of art? You know what, I haven\u0027t even looked at it in a while. I don\u0027t remember. It was a freebie. It was a freebie at some event about NFTs. You know how these things go.\nLauren Goode: Wow. Have you checked the value of it lately?\nGideon Lichfield: I\u0027m not even sure it has value.Lauren Goode: OK. I wrote a story last year for WIRED about a Steph Curry NFT that I had been, I guess, gifted. It was on loan to me, and I think at the time that I acquired it, which is February of 2022, and by the time I wrote about it, which was the spring or maybe summer of 2022, [laughter] it had declined in value from like $1,000 to $6.\nGideon Lichfield: Wow. OK. I mean, I feel like we\u0027re just exposing our Luddite tendencies here by talking about how we don\u0027t own any crypto. And it used to be this thing that journalists shouldn\u0027t own cryptocurrency because it was like having a conflict of interest. I think definitely we should be past that by now. Certainly if you\u0027re going to write about cryptocurrency, I think it makes sense to at least own a token amount of it so you understand how it works.\nLauren Goode: Well, that\u0027s good that I own some then.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes, indeed. It is. You have more authority than I do.\nLauren Goode: I\u0027m looking at my Robinhood app right now, and according to this, on the day of taping, I am $15.27 in a hole on my sliver of a bitcoin. So I\u0027m doing really well here. I mean, I bought—\nGideon Lichfield: When did you buy the sliver of a bitcoin?\nLauren Goode: Let\u0027s see if I can tap on it and see my history. Well, I\u0027m checking my positions right now. It\u0027s actually up 43 percent over the past year according to this. Why am I down? I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t understand it. I quite really don\u0027t understand it.\nGideon Lichfield: Just wait long enough and you\u0027ll be up again. That is the nature of these things.\nLauren Goode: I can tell you that even if we emerge from this trough, this crypto winter and this surges, I\u0027m still not going to be able to retire.\nGideon Lichfield: So you\u0027re saying you\u0027re not giving up the day job?\nLauren Goode: No, not giving up the day job. And I would say that I\u0027m still a crypto skeptic like you, and I\u0027m wondering, did your conversation with Michael Casey make you any less skeptical?\nGideon Lichfield: I don\u0027t think it did. I mean, I think the argument that I was having back and forth with Michael at some level was about whether the potential for cryptocurrency to be a well-regulated, well-run, largely fraud-free industry depended on the technology itself, on the ability of the technology to provide decentralized systems, or whether it is really entirely dependent on the human beings and human beings tendency to find graft opportunities wherever they can. And so Michael was saying to me, look, the traditional financial industry is full of fraud as well and the crypto industry has a chance to be better because it has this decentralized technology.\nLauren Goode: I guess I\u0027m still wondering whether or not you\u0027re convinced.Gideon Lichfield: I want to not be quite as skeptical as I am, and maybe I should just buy some crypto and get into it so that I can ease my skepticism that way. But for me, the thing that is fundamental here is when you look at the crypto industry, the promise of crypto was supposed to be the decentralization that no one person or entity was going to have power over these systems. And as I was saying to Michael, what you\u0027ve seen emerge again and again is that even when you have decentralized currencies on a blockchain, you still need some centralized entity somewhere along the line for it to work. You need an exchange where cryptocurrency is turned into conventional currency, you need a marketplace where NFTs are bought and sold, you need some system for, let\u0027s say, blockchains have been used for land registries, for example, but somebody needs to authenticate that you actually own that land before you can put it on a blockchain. So no matter where you are in the system, there is an opportunity for humans to insert themselves, for power to be centralized and for fraud to happen, and I\u0027m just not convinced that that can ever be overcome. But Michael was arguing if we only regulate things well enough, and if the crypto industry itself somehow gets its act together, despite having been so fraud-ridden up to now, then maybe things can get better.\nLauren Goode: He seemed to be implying that the SEC\u0027s efforts to regulate crypto are inspired by vengeance rather than motivated by a real desire to protect investors. Do you agree with that?\nGideon Lichfield: Not really. I mean, he was saying that lots and lots of lawmakers took money from Sam Bankman-Fried, which is true. He was spreading his largesse left and right and that therefore the SEC\u0027s enforcement against the industry was kind of payback for that, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s true at all. I think the effort to regulate cryptocurrencies as securities dates back long before most people had heard of Sam Bankman-Fried, and it is this debate that\u0027s been running for a while about whether these assets that can be much more than just a currency, like in the case of Ethereum, it\u0027s essentially the basis for an entire programming language, whether those should be regulated like securities that people trade in other ways or whether they should be dealt with as some kind of a new thing. And I agree, I suppose, with Michael that we need to not try to apply 100-year-old securities laws to these entirely new instruments. We ought to come up with something better. But on the other hand, I think that trying to protect investors from these very, very volatile markets is a sensible instinct. And much as people like Michael Casey would like cryptocurrencies to be treated as more than just a speculative investment, the fact is that they are being treated as a speculative investment and that is what the SEC is trying to protect people from.Lauren Goode: So Michael also talked about the \"monopolization of our lives.\" He said we\u0027re moving into an AI world in which decentralized entities, and he was talking about companies like Google and Meta are driven to manipulate us with that data, our data, and are going to get even more powerful. That really resonated with me. But how do you think he meant crypto is supposed to solve that?\nGideon Lichfield: I can\u0027t say that I understand this argument very well, but it\u0027s one I\u0027ve encountered in the past, which is if we own our data, if we have access to or control data about us, or data about our customers, for example, or our followers on social media, if we have that data and we control it and it\u0027s on a blockchain rather than being held by a centralized company like Google or Facebook, if we have that control, then we have power over that data, then we can decide what happens to it, we can find ways to make money off of it, we can decide who to transfer it to, but it\u0027s never going to be in the hands of a company that can take it away from us. How exactly that\u0027s supposed to work is the stuff that I don\u0027t understand very well, but that\u0027s the kind of the principle that a lot of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts talk about.\nLauren Goode: So what\u0027s actually a better solution here? Introducing a decentralized but potentially befuddling new form of internet or regulating the monopolies as they currently exist?\nGideon Lichfield: So I think that is the key question. Michael and I actually got into a discussion on this that was too long to include in the podcast. But a few weeks ago, you interviewed Cory Doctorow here on the show and Cory\u0027s belief, like Michael\u0027s, is that we need to strip away the power of these gigantic tech companies that control all our data. But they come at it from very, very different ways of how to do it. And so Michael is saying if we use blockchains and cryptocurrency, we can give people ownership of their data in such a way that it is decentralized, no single entity controls it, and then that gives people the power. Cory takes a rather different view and he says what we need is interoperability. We need to force the big tech companies to let us move our data back and forth between them to if we decide we want to take our contact or our social media graph or all our photos and videos and whatever off of Meta and put them onto some other company\u0027s platform, we should be able to do that. And if regulation forces the tech companies to let us do that, that will put power back in the hands of the people.\nLauren Goode: How to build a better internet—that\u0027s what it is, that\u0027s sort of what we\u0027re getting at. In fact, we should probably just rebrand the show that.Gideon Lichfield: Yeah, how to build a better internet. But if you\u0027re asking me which of those approaches I believe in more, I suppose I probably lean more towards interoperability. I feel like it\u0027s going to be easier to introduce regulation that forces companies to let their users move their data around than it is to build an entire new system for data management and ownership based on blockchains and make that system easy to use and understandable to everybody \u0027cause right now it\u0027s really confusing, but of course Michael would disagree with me on that.\nLauren Goode: So what do you think that means for the future of the blockchain then? I mean, does it mean that 10 years from now we\u0027re still talking about it as something that like the folks over at Andreessen Horowitz are using and [laughter] maybe a few outliers around the world and we\u0027re still just battling for a better internet based on the infrastructure we currently have?\nGideon Lichfield: I actually think that despite my skepticism, I\u0027m relatively bullish for the future of the blockchain and crypto \u0027cause I think so many people are invested in it at this point. So many people are working on different variations of this technology. That there is still going to be an industry in five or 10 years time. I\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s going to be doing. Perhaps I will be proved wrong on a lot of the things I\u0027ve said about how susceptible it is to fraud and corruption or how difficult it is to use. Maybe those problems will be solved and Michael is right. Most revealing and possibly most realistic is that crypto does have a future, but it\u0027s one in which it\u0027s basically been co-opted by the existing big tech platforms and by the existing big banks and they all issue their own ETFs for crypto, and we end up in a similar—\nLauren Goode: The Vanguards of the world and Fidelity\u0027s of the world. It\u0027s not very sexy.\nGideon Lichfield: It\u0027s not very sexy, but it\u0027s like the Occam\u0027s razor prediction that things will change less than you expect. And so we will end up with crypto, but it will still be run by big banks.\nLauren Goode: And at that point, I will be retired on my crypto earnings.\nGideon Lichfield: I very much hope so for your sake.\nLauren Goode: My sliver of bitcoin. That\u0027s a very optimistic view of the future.\nGideon Lichfield: In that case, let\u0027s end on that note.\nLauren Goode: Alright, that\u0027s our show for today. Thanks so much for listening.\nGideon Lichfield: Have a Nice Future is hosted by me, Gideon Lichfield.\nLauren Goode: And me, Lauren Goode. And if you like the show, we would love to hear from you.

This knowledge is all thanks to the QR code on the shirt’s label and hangtag.\nScanning the QR code takes them to the shirt’s entry on the Aura Blockchain Consortium—a blockchain that is equally owned by a who’s who of luxury companies: LVMH, OTB Group, Prada, Richemont, and Mercedes-Benz. \nA Loro Piana analyst assessing the quality of some fibers.\nYou’ve likely heard of the blockchain, but if you’re still in the dark about what it is, a blockchain network is essentially a shared, digital ledger of transactions which, once recorded, can’t be changed or tampered with—although they can be viewed by anyone. Take, for example, our writer’s shirt. They can claim ownership of it by using the pin code they were given on purchase, as well as see the details of how it was made and its care instructions—all by scanning the QR code on the label. And if they were to try and sell it, potential buyers could verify that it’s an authentic Loro Piana shirt—that the seller owns—by looking it up on the Aura Blockchain Consortium before its ownership is officially transferred—with this transfer being recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see.\nCreated in April 2021, the Aura Blockchain Consortium was built in an effort to innovate, push sustainability (it’s pledged to be carbon neutral by 2025), and give customers transparency.\nThe use of blockchain technology in luxury markets has two obvious upsides: It will be harder for scammers to try and pass off fake luxury goods as genuine items when they don’t have the proper QR code. Sellers of stolen luxury goods will also have a hard time when the blockchain shows that they don’t own what they’re selling.For Loro Piana, the use of the blockchain is a natural next step in its technical evolution, since it’s one of the few luxury fashion companies to be vertically integrated. It has grown over the years from a family of wool fabric merchants in the 19th century to the innovator it is today—a company that controls its entire production process. Today, Loro Piana sources its own raw materials, manufactures them, and retails its wears, offering its customers a unique end product that has been quality controlled all the way back to the fiber it’s made from.\nNot every Loro Piana item is certified via the Aura Blockchain Consortium—yet. The luxury brand is rolling out the technology starting with its most exclusive offering: those made from the finest merino wool there is, The Gift of Kings®. Specifically, its Spring/Summer 2023 The Gift of Kings® Ready to Wear collection, as well as 20 individual The Gift of Kings® pieces that will be sold at its new Palo Alto store to celebrate its launch—and which come with their own exclusive NFTs created by artist Charlotte Taylor, which can only be transferred if the garment’s ownership is transferred.\nProducts made with The Gift of Kings® wool fiber are highly sought after, seeing as there are just over 4,400 pounds of it produced every year by Loro Piana’s local breeding partners in Australia and New Zealand. Loro Piana holds its annual Record Bale event to award one of these wool breeders the title of “Finest Merino Wool in the World”—with the all-time record being 10.3 microns. The Gift of Kings® fibers are, on average, around 12 microns thick (our writer’s shirt fibers are 12.6 microns in diameter, according to its entry on the Aura Blockchain Consortium). Compare this to the red blood cell of a human, which is 5 microns, and the average human hair, which is 80-100 microns in diameter, and you can see why it’s so special—and worthy of digital authentication and certification.\nThe Gift of Kings® collection being added to the Aura Blockchain Consortium is just the start for Loro Piana—it plans to roll out the technology across its Excellences collections in the future. But, for now, it’s exciting to see how this new technology could revolutionize the fashion industry and give customers like our writer the transparency they crave in a digital world.\n1 / 5\nThe shorn wool is scoured to remove any dirt or dust before being packaged and shipped to the manufacturing facilities in Italy.\nThis story was produced by WIRED Brand Lab for Loro Piana.","tags":[""],"creation_date":"2023-03-16"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-1-billion-crypto-heist/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The same chaotic day FTX declared bankruptcy, someone began stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from its coffers. A WIRED investigation reveals the company’s “very crazy night” trying to stop them.","title":"Inside FTX’s All-Night Race to Stop a $1 Billion Crypto Heist","detailed_content":"BY THE EVENING of November 11 of last year, FTX’s staff had already endured one of the worst days in the company’s short life. What had recently been one of the world\u0027s top cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at $32 billion only 10 months earlier, had just declared bankruptcy. Executives had, after an extended struggle, persuaded the company\u0027s CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to hand over the reins to John Ray III, a new chief executive now tasked with shepherding the company through a nightmarish thicket of debts, many of which it seemed to have no means to pay.\nFTX had, it seemed, hit rock bottom. Until someone—a thief or thieves who have yet to be identified—chose that particular moment to make things far worse. That Friday evening, exhausted FTX staffers began to see mysterious outflows of the company\u0027s cryptocurrency, publicly captured on the Etherscan website that tracks the Ethereum blockchain, representing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto being stolen in real time.\n“Holy shit,” one former FTX staffer, who asked not to be named because they weren\u0027t authorized to speak about internal company matters, remembers thinking. “After all this, we’re being hacked?”\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nAccording to its own accounting, FTX would ultimately lose between $415 million and $432 million worth of its cryptocurrency holdings to those unidentified thieves, numbers it has publicly confirmed as part of its bankruptcy process. What FTX hasn\u0027t previously revealed is how close it may have come to losing vastly more—how its staff and outside consultants raced to move more than $1 billion worth of crypto to more secure storage before it could be stolen by the malevolent presence on its network—even, at one point, scrambling to send close to half a billion dollars to a physical USB drive in one consultant\u0027s office in an effort to keep it out of the thieves\u0027 hands.\n“Invitation: Urgent”\nAs the trial of FTX\u0027s disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried enters its second week, many in the cryptocurrency community are closely watching courtroom events for any hint of how the exchange was so catastrophically looted, just hours after it left his control. The question of who carried out that theft—and whether the thieves were FTX insiders or external hackers—looms largest of all. That mystery remains unsolved, and neither Bankman-Fried nor other top FTX executives have been charged with that theft.\nSign Up Today\nKeep up-to-date with the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried by signing up for our Daily newsletter.\nBut now, WIRED can reveal the events of FTX’s panicky night working to limit the damage from that theft—and to prevent what might otherwise have been a 10-figure heist. The new FTX leadership under Ray, its new CEO, declined to be interviewed about the incident. But WIRED learned the hour-by-hour details of the crisis response from a detailed invoice submitted by the restructuring firm Alvarez \u0026 Marsall for its work on FTX\u0027s bankruptcy case, interviews with individuals who participated in the immediate response to the theft, and blockchain analysis provided by the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic.\nThat response started around 10 pm on the evening of November 11, when Zach Dexter, the chief executive of FTX subsidiary LedgerX, sent a Google Meet invite to a group of more than 20 of FTX’s remaining staff, bankruptcy lawyers, advisers, and consultants. The invitation’s one-word subject line: “urgent.”\nA handful of staffers quickly joined that Google Meet video call, which would eventually grow to dozens of participants over the next 12 hours. They could all see FTX wallets being drained in real time on Etherscan. But almost no one on the call had any idea where exactly FTX stored its cryptocurrency or how it managed the secret keys that controlled those wallets. That knowledge was held only by a small group of FTX elite—Bankman-Fried and his inner circle. Bankman-Fried never appeared in the meeting, according to sources who were present, but Gary Wang, the FTX cofounder and CTO, did join the call.By this point Wang was distrusted by many people close to Ray, sources say. In the midst of FTX’s meltdown, Wang had initially sided with Bankman-Fried and had only distanced himself from the former CEO after days of persuasion from others within the company.\nWang didn\u0027t win over any of his critics in the emergency meeting when he initially suggested the ongoing theft could be halted by simply changing the secret keys that protected the wallets that were being emptied. That seemed pointless, the former FTX staffer remembers thinking, given that whoever had gained access to the network could simply grab the new keys and continue their heist. “The fox is in the hen house, and you’re going to change the keys to the hen house?” the former staffer remembers thinking. Wang, who has since pleaded guilty to the same criminal charges Bankman-Fried now faces, did not respond to a request for comment sent to his attorney\nJust as the Google Meet call started, however, LedgerX’s Dexter had started exploring a different approach to protecting FTX’s funds. The week before the theft, digital asset trust company BitGo had been negotiating with Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell, the law firm overseeing FTX’s bankruptcy process, to take custody of the firm’s remaining cryptocurrency holdings. So Dexter now called BitGo to try to circumvent the long legal contract process Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell had begun with the company. Instead, Dexter asked BitGo to immediately create “cold storage” wallets—wallets that would be kept securely offline—that FTX could move all its remaining funds into as a safe haven. Dexter did not respond to a request for comment.\nBitGo said it could have the wallets ready in around half an hour. FTX staffers worried that this would still be too slow. The thieves could potentially take hundreds of millions of dollars more worth of crypto out of the company’s wallets by then.\nSomeone on the Google Meet call asked if anyone had a hardware wallet of their own where the money could be stored until BitGo was ready. Kumanan Ramanathan, an adviser to FTX from Alvarez \u0026 Marsall calling in from his house in the suburbs of New York, volunteered. He had a Ledger Nano—a USB drive hardware wallet—in his home office that he offered to set up as a temporary refuge for the vulnerable money.\nRamanathan set up a new wallet on his Ledger Nano at around 10:30 pm ET on November 11. The former FTX staffer remembers watching him check and double-check the password that he\u0027d created for that wallet. Wang began sending FTX’s funds to it, and soon Ramanathan was holding between $400 and $500 million in the company’s crypto assets on a USB drive in his Westchester County home.\nA Late-Night 911 Call\nMinutes later, BitGo told the FTX staffers that its wallets were ready, and they began transferring hundreds of millions more in crypto to BitGo’s cold storage instead of Ramanathan\u0027s Ledger device. For the rest of that sleepless night, the staffers hunted for every wallet where FTX’s money was stored and transferred every coin they could find to BitGo. “They were scrubbing various systems trying to find where various private keys were, where assets were held,” says another person involved in the response, granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak about it publicly. “It was just chaos.”\nAs FTX\u0027s staff focused on getting executives to sign off on those transfers of potentially vulnerable funds, Ramanathan was left holding the crypto that Wang had initially transferred to his Ledger wallet. That created the bizarre situation of an individual physically possessing around half a billion dollars worth of FTX\u0027s money, which presented its own unique legal and security risks. That night, Ryne Miller, the general counsel for FTX, rushed to Ramanathan\u0027s home to help safeguard it. Ryne Miller declined to comment for this story, and Ramanathan didn’t respond to a request for comment.At 10:59 pm Ramanathan called the police to report a theft in progress and explain that he was holding a very large amount of the victim\u0027s money, requesting that officers come to his house to help protect it. After all, no one knew then—or now—who had stolen the other funds, and if they might try to physically take the stash that Ramanathan held too. A police report from the New Rochelle Police Department obtained by WIRED shows that Ramanathan told the 911 dispatcher that “there is a huge crypto hit currently going on and that there is a large amount of money being sent to this address” and that he “fears the house is going to become a target.”\nEven after the police arrived, Miller, FTX\u0027s general counsel, stayed at the house for most of the night. Ramanathan\u0027s record of billable hours shows that he and Miller spent nearly three and half hours in his home, from around 2 am to 5 am, on November 12.\nNo physical threat to Ramanathan or his home materialized. In fact, the siphoning of funds from FTX had stopped when the money was moved to Ramanathan\u0027s Ledger wallet. “He took a huge fucking risk using his personal Ledger,” says the former FTX staffer. “He’s a total boss. It’s my pretty strong feeling that if we hadn’t pulled this Ledger stunt, we would have lost significantly more money.” The money in Ramanathan\u0027s home office was finally transferred to BitGo by around 5 am on Saturday, November 12. The company would ultimately hold $1.1 billion of the remaining FTX funds.\nLater on Saturday, Bankman-Fried and Wang transferred another $400 million plus to accounts under the control of the Bahamas government for safeguarding, as reported by Forbes and recorded in a court filing. At some points, that movement of funds to the Bahamas appears to have been confused with the theft itself. A week after the theft, some media outlets incorrectly reported that the stolen funds had actually been seized by the Bahamian government. As evidence to the contrary, cryptocurrency tracing firms like Elliptic and Chainalysis have observed portions of the actual stolen funds being sent to “mixing” services often used to launder stolen crypto funds such as Railgun and the cross-blockchain coin swap service THORChain, behavior typical of thieves who pull off large-scale crypto heists.\nFew Safeguards, No Map\nIn the months since the desperate rescue effort of November 11, FTX’s new regime, which is handling the company’s bankruptcy process, has publicly alleged glaring security failings that made the theft possible.\nAn April report released as part of FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings listed examples of that alleged neglect: The previous FTX regime had no independent chief information security officer or actual dedicated security team; it kept virtually all its cryptocurrency in hot wallets—wallets on computers connected to the internet—despite employees being instructed to publicly claim that it stored as little as 10 percent in hot wallets; it left keys to those wallets unencrypted or failed to properly set up security systems where multiple keys are needed to unlock funds; and it lacked the logging systems to even know who was moving funds and when, along with many other issues.The same report describes the impossible situation that the new FTX regime faced on November 11, when, in its first day in charge, it discovered it had inherited a deeply compromised network. “Due to the FTX Group’s deficient controls to secure crypto assets, the Debtors faced the threat that billions of dollars of additional assets could be lost at any moment,” the report reads, using the term “debtors” to describe the new FTX administration led by Ray. “As the Debtors worked to identify and access crypto assets with no ‘map’ to guide them, the Debtors had to engineer technological pathways to transfer many types of assets they identified to cold storage.”\nGiven that apparently shambolic security and disorganization, it’s perhaps not a surprise that FTX became the target of one of the costliest crypto heists in history. But if not for a few quick decisions in the midst of that chaos, it now appears that it could have been far worse.\n“It was a very, very crazy night,” the former FTX staffer says. “We worked on it, we got it done, and we saved a massive amount of customers’ money.”\nUpdated at 10:35 am ET, October 10, 2023, to clarify THORChain\u0027s functionality.\nUpdated at 3:50 pm ET, October 10, 2023, to add details from a New Rochelle Police Department report detailing Ramanathan\u0027s 911 call. We also clarified that Ramanathan and Miller were at Ramanathan\u0027s home when the 911 call took place and while they awaited the transfer to BitGo.","tags":["","FTX TRIAL","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CYBERSECURITY","CRIME"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2023-10-09"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/border-surveillance-india-assassination-project-nimbus-security-roundup/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Plus: An assassination plot, an AI security bill, a Project Nimbus revelation, and more of the week’s top security news.","title":"A New Surveillance Tool Invades Border Towns","detailed_content":"This week, WIRED reported that a group of prolific scammers known as the Yahoo Boys are openly operating on major platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, TikTok, and Telegram.

Now a second group is demanding money, and it has sent WIRED samples of what they claim is the company\u0027s stolen data.","title":"Change Healthcare Faces Another Ransomware Threat—and It Looks Credible","detailed_content":"For months, Change Healthcare has faced an immensely messy ransomware debacle that has left hundreds of pharmacies and medical practices across the United States unable to process claims. Now, thanks to an apparent dispute within the ransomware criminal ecosystem, it may have just become far messier still.\nIn March, the ransomware group AlphV, which had claimed credit for encrypting Change Healthcare’s network and threatened to leak reams of the company’s sensitive health care data, received a $22 million payment—evidence, publicly captured on Bitcoin’s blockchain, that Change Healthcare had very likely caved to its tormentors’ ransom demand, though the company has yet to confirm that it paid. But in a new definition of a worst-case ransomware, a different ransomware group claims to be holding Change Healthcare’s stolen data and is demanding a payment of their own.\nSince Monday, RansomHub, a relatively new ransomware group, has posted to its dark-web site that it has 4 terabytes of Change Healthcare’s stolen data, which it threatened to sell to the “highest bidder” if Change Healthcare didn’t pay an unspecified ransom. RansomHub tells WIRED it is not affiliated with AlphV and “can’t say” how much it’s demanding as a ransom payment.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nForensics Expert Answers Crime Scene Questions From Twitter\nRansomHub initially declined to publish or provide WIRED any sample data from that stolen trove to prove its claim. But on Friday, a representative for the group sent WIRED several screenshots of what appeared to be patient records and a data-sharing contract for United Healthcare, which owns Change Healthcare, and Emdeon, which acquired Change Healthcare in 2014 and later took its name.\nWhile WIRED could not fully confirm RansomHub’s claims, the samples suggest that this second extortion attempt against Change Healthcare may be more than an empty threat. “For anyone doubting that we have the data, and to anyone speculating the criticality and the sensitivity of the data, the images should be enough to show the magnitude and importance of the situation and clear the unrealistic and childish theories,” the RansomHub contact tells WIRED in an email.\n“We are working with law enforcement and outside experts to investigate claims posted online to understand the extent of potentially impacted data,” Change Healthcare said in an email to WIRED. “Our investigation remains active and ongoing. There is no evidence of any new cyber incident at Change Healthcare.”\nBrett Callow, a ransomware analyst with security firm Emsisoft, says he believes AlphV did not originally publish any data from the incident, and the origin of RansomHub’s data is unclear. “I obviously don\u0027t know whether the data is real—it could have been pulled from elsewhere—but nor do I see anything that indicates it may not be authentic,” he says of the data shared by RansomHub.\nJon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at threat intelligence firm Analyst1, says he believes RansomHub is “telling the truth and does have Change HealthCare’s data,” after reviewing the information sent to WIRED. While RansomHub is a new ransomware threat actor, DiMaggio says, they are quickly “gaining momentum.”\nIf RansomHub’s claims are real, it will mean that Change Healthcare’s already catastrophic ransomware ordeal has become a kind of cautionary tale about the dangers of trusting ransomware groups to follow through on their promises, even after a ransom is paid. In March, someone who goes by the name “notchy” posted to a Russian cybercriminal forum that AlphV had pocketed that $22 million payment and disappeared without sharing a commission with the “affiliate” hackers who typically partner with ransomware groups and often penetrate victims’ networks on their behalf.Notchy’s post suggested that Change Healthcare faced an unprecedented situation: It had allegedly already paid a ransom, yet jilted partners of the gang extorting it still felt they were owed money—and still possessed Change Healthcare’s stolen data. RansomHub tells WIRED it is associated with notchy.\nNow, RansomHub has claimed “the data remains with the affiliate,” and AlphV did not directly have the data originally. WIRED could not verify these claims. “For everyone speculating and theorizing on the situation, AlphV stole our share of the payment and performed an exit scam,” a RansomHub representative wrote to WIRED. “AlphV performed the exit scam before we get to the data deletion part.”\nCallow says the incident reinforces that cybercriminals can’t be trusted to delete data, even when they are paid. For example, when a global law enforcement operation disrupted the notorious LockBit ransomware group, in February, police said they discovered that the cybercriminals still had data that investigators had paid to be deleted.\n“Sometimes they use the undeleted data to extort victims for a second time, and the risk of re-extortion will only increase as law enforcement up their disruption efforts and throw the ransomware ecosystem into chaos,” Callow says. “What were always unpredictable outcomes will now be even more unpredictable.”\nSimilarly, DiMaggio says victims of ransomware attacks need to learn they can’t trust cybercriminals. “Victims need to understand that paying a criminal who promises to delete their data permanently is a myth,” DiMaggio says. “They are paying to have their data taken off the public side of the ransomware attackers data leak site. They should assume it is never actually deleted.”\nUnitedHealth Group’s website says it is continuing to “make progress in mitigating the impact” of the attack and expanding financial assistance to health care providers that have been impacted. However, the attack has sent long-lasting ripples across medical facilities in the United States, demonstrating how disruptive ransomware attacks can be and the difficulties in restoring services. Clinicians and patients alike have been impacted, with extra strain being placed upon medical business owners.\nOn Wednesday, the American Medical Association said “serious disruptions continue” across physician practices. A survey of AMA members, conducted between March 26 and April 3, found 80 percent of clinicians had lost revenue and many are using their own personal finances to cover a practice’s expenses. Medical practitioners responding to the survey said they were heading toward bankruptcy, were struggling to “manage pain care” for cancer patients, and that procedures had been delayed. “Practices will close because of this incident,” Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, the president of the AMA said in a statement, “and patients will lose access to their physicians.”\nIn a message to WIRED, the RansomHub contact claims—for whatever the word of a ransomware gang is worth—that they are different from other cybercriminals, and if Change Healthcare pays them, they wouldn’t try to extort it again. “We will delete the data,” they write. “This data is a bomb for us. If we can\u0027t get payment, we have no choice but to sell it. Of course, if we can reach an agreement, it will be better to delete the data and throw the bomb away.”\nUpdated 4/12/2024, 9:18 pm ET: Added comment from Change Healthcare.","tags":["","RANSOMWARE","CYBERSECURITY","HACKING","CRIME","HEALTHCARE"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2024-04-12"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/binance-coinbase-regulatory-turf-war/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"US agencies are sparring over who gets to oversee the crypto industry, and companies are stuck in the middle.","title":"Binance and Coinbase Have Been Sucked Into a Regulatory Turf War","detailed_content":"ON MARCH 22, Coinbase, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, was sent a notice by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warning that the regulator planned to sue, alleging the company had violated securities laws.

Nope, I hated that.\n[Laughter]\nLauren Goode: Three, two, one. Hi, I\u0027m Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And I\u0027m Gideon Lichfield. And this is Have a Nice Future, a podcast about how terrifyingly fast everything is changing.\nLauren Goode: Each week we talk to someone with big, audacious, and sometimes unnerving ideas about the future, and we ask them how we can all prepare to live in it.\nGideon Lichfield: Our guest this week is Luukas Ilves. He is the chief information officer of the government of Estonia, which people often talk about as one of the most digitally advanced governments in the world.\nLuukas Ilves (audio clip): The fact that other countries in a couple of years time can look at what we\u0027ve done, learn these lessons, and then kind of catapult themselves into being the same league with us, that gives me ground for optimism that actually governments can get better at this.Lauren Goode: So Gideon, I\u0027ve heard passing references to Estonia as this magical, futuristic place where everything runs on the blockchain or something. But I have to confess, I know very little about Estonia. I am going to be the proxy today for audience members listening to this who are like, “I know nothing about Estonia, tell me.”\nGideon Lichfield: That is your job.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s my job.\n[Chuckle]\nGideon Lichfield: OK, well, so let me ask you something. In the last five years or so, how many times do you think you have filled in exactly the same information: your name, address, phone, email, social security number, health conditions, whatever, every single time you\u0027ve gone to see a new doctor or applied for a driver\u0027s license, or done pretty much any other bit of bureaucracy?\nLauren Goode: A lot. A hundred. You\u0027re saying within the past year? I can\u0027t even begin to count.\nGideon Lichfield: Or five … However long. Yes.\nLauren Goode: I can\u0027t begin to remember. That\u0027s actually just called adulting.\nGideon Lichfield: That\u0027s why it\u0027s so hard.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nGideon Lichfield: So what if you never had to do that again? You show up at a new doctor\u0027s office or at City Hall or at the bank, and you just prove to them that you are you, and they say, “OK, thank you Ms. Goode. Just tap here to accept our services, and we will have all the data on you that we need.”\nLauren Goode: So it\u0027s like Apple Pay for government?\nGideon Lichfield: Sure, if you want.\nLauren Goode: I think this is good as long as the data is secure.\nGideon Lichfield: Yeah. So what Estonia has is this advanced system for permissioning data. Different bits of the government, and also different private companies, all have data on you. But you can decide who gets to see which data from which place. This system they call the X-Road is basically a backbone for transferring data between different entities. And what\u0027s more, you not only can give permission to individual people or entities to see bits of your data, you can also see who has looked at it every single time, so you have total transparency into how your data is being used, which you certainly don\u0027t here in the US.\nLauren Goode: Ah, that must be where the blockchain comes in.\nGideon Lichfield: Somewhere in there the blockchain comes in. Yeah. It\u0027s possibly the first use of a blockchain I\u0027ve actually believed in.\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: So let\u0027s go even further. Let\u0027s say you don\u0027t have to file your taxes—\nLauren Goode: I\u0027m listening.\nGideon Lichfield: You just get a notification from the government that your tax return is ready, you take a look, and if it looks good to you, you click accept, and your taxes are done.Lauren Goode: What if they don\u0027t look good?\nGideon Lichfield: Then you can change them.\nLauren Goode: OK. I\u0027m just saying if you have, like, a quibble about something.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes.\nLauren Goode: OK. I like the sound of this too.\nGideon Lichfield: And now let\u0027s imagine you\u0027re eligible for some kind of state benefit, like disability or an education grant or childcare but you don\u0027t have to apply for it, you don\u0027t even have to know it exists, you just get a notification from the government saying that you qualify for this thing, do you want it? If yes, click here.\nLauren Goode: How does the government know you\u0027re about to have a baby? Are they spying?\nGideon Lichfield: [Chuckle] No, but if it knows you\u0027ve had a baby, if you\u0027ve been to the hospital and registered a birth—\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: Then they—\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: Kick in automatically.\nLauren Goode: OK, so there\u0027s one side of this that sounds a little bit Big Brother, and then there\u0027s another part of me that thinks this is probably how a fully digitized government should work.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. It\u0027s kind of like Steve Jobs used to say about Apple products, “It should just work.”\nLauren Goode: And so, Luukas\u0027 job is to make this all work?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, not his job alone, but he is the guy in charge of overseeing the digital transformation that started about 30 years ago, and continuing to advance it across all the government.\nLauren Goode: Estonia is pretty small though, right? So to ask a question that perhaps a Silicon Valley VC would ask, can it scale? Is this something that the United States could conceivably do?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, that\u0027s what I wanted to talk to Luukas about. Because Estonia is seen as this poster child for digital government, to the point where it\u0027s kind of become a cliché. People say, “Oh, yeah, Estonia.” But good luck trying to replicate what Estonia does anywhere else. I basically wanted to ask Luukas how exportable is the Estonian model. And he seemed to think it wasn\u0027t as unique to Estonia as you might imagine.\nLauren Goode: Well, I can\u0027t wait to hear this.\nGideon Lichfield: And that conversation is coming up right after the break.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Luukas Ilves, welcome to Have a Nice Future.\nLuukas Ilves: Thanks, Gideon, it\u0027s a pleasure to be on.\nGideon Lichfield: Are you having a nice future?\nLuukas Ilves: I am. Although for me, it\u0027s my present.\nGideon Lichfield: I think most of our listeners probably have heard that Estonia is a pioneer in digital government, but they don\u0027t know much about what that means in practice. So can you briefly talk about the key things that make it a leader?Luukas Ilves: Sure. I mean, the headline point is really simple, which is just that everything\u0027s digital. There isn\u0027t a government service or an interaction between citizen or business and government that hasn\u0027t been digitized at this point. So everything from the mundane that should be digital at this point in pretty much every country in the world, like filing your taxes, permitting of any kind to—you know, some things that are a bit less digitized in most parts of the world, such as voting, where we\u0027ve been able to vote online since 2004, and in our most recent elections, more than half of people did. And of course beyond just digitizing things, we have a very strong focus on taking advantage of all the sort of, the tools that new tech gives us to constantly make stuff better, whether that\u0027s better from the perspective of transparency and accountability, convenience, or cost effectiveness. So in some ways, I\u0027d say it\u0027s almost unremarkable. We do in government what pretty much everyone in the world everywhere does with digital transformation, which is to find ways to constantly get better at what they\u0027re doing using the technologies of the day.\nGideon Lichfield: Estonia has been on this journey of digitizing government for about 30 years, so how did it get started, and why do you think it got a head start on so many other places?\nLuukas Ilves: Well, the interesting thing is we didn\u0027t get a head start, we had a very late start. So when did the US start digitizing government? Late ‘40s or the early ’50s with a bunch of mainframes. And even countries that you don\u0027t think of as being wealthier, super technologically advanced, have been doing digital government, at least in the sense of having government mainframes running back-office processes since the 1960s. Estonia was forcibly occupied by the Soviet Union until 1991, and so in a sense, a lot of our government processes were much more backward technologically. And when we regained our independence in 1991, we effectively had a clean reboot of a lot of how government functioned, and so we got lucky in timing. We started at a time where the thinking had just radically shifted in terms of what providing a service means. We were in the era of the internet. And the second is that we didn\u0027t have a lot in the way of resources. So we couldn\u0027t just sort of take 1980s enterprise IT, because we didn\u0027t have the ability to afford IBM and Accenture to come in and build that for us. And so, you know, initially, a lot of what we did was bootstrapped, and at the time fairly young tech guys figuring out very organically, well, what makes sense, what kind of fits our functional requirements?\nGideon Lichfield: Let\u0027s talk about some of the implications of what that actually means for users of government services. So Estonia has this principle that no piece of data should have to be entered twice. How does that change the experience for people compared with a country like sitting here in the US, every time you go to see a different doctor, you have to fill in forms all over again?Luukas Ilves: That\u0027s right. So that\u0027s what we call the once-only principle. If the government has asked you for a piece of data, they don\u0027t have a right to ask you for that same data again in a different context. So that means prefilled tax declarations, where Estonians like to compete on how long it takes them to declare their taxes, and what they\u0027re really competing on is who\u0027s faster at logging on to the tax service, pressing accept, and being done.\nGideon Lichfield: How long does it take then to file one\u0027s taxes?\nLuukas Ilves: If you don\u0027t actually look at the declaration, you can do it in about 15 seconds. So what\u0027s happening in the background there is that we have a pretty good taxonomy of the data that government has, and when one public body has a reason to use data, then they go and query that from another public body based on the legal authorization they have to use that data. But the benefits aren\u0027t just around convenience. It makes our public services work more effectively, it reduces a lot of error, and a lot of the sort of difficulties in public service delivery where disadvantaged populations might not get access to a service because they don\u0027t know about some kind of an opportunity or an entitlement—that you can sort of do away with. It reduces a lot of opportunities for fraud on the one hand, but also corruption on the part of officials. And it also, we at least think, makes us better at protecting our citizens\u0027 data, because instead of having massive amounts of data over-collected everywhere and generally not necessarily thawed and safeguarded too well, if we\u0027ve got a piece of sensitive data, then we focus on keeping that well protected in one context, making sure the access rules are strictly enforced and making sure the right protections are in place, and then giving our citizens transparency on how that data is actually used.\nGideon Lichfield: So my sense from having visited Estonia a number of times over the last couple of decades, it\u0027s a pretty technologically literate country. But there will always be some people, and especially the elderly, who find digital services a little harder to handle, or who are especially vulnerable to hacking and having their data compromised. How do you help those people, and how do you make sure nobody\u0027s getting left behind?\nLuukas Ilves: So there\u0027s a two-part answer. The first, of course, is how you actually build your digital services to address these problems. So it\u0027s a basic, first of all, user design question, where you can have very complex services that can still be easy to use or that can be a nightmare to use. And the same thing is true for instance, for questions around identity theft or hacking. Part of having a security ID is it puts additional barriers in place to some of the usual ways in which credentials would get stolen. So for part of the elderly population, you\u0027re gonna solve that question by having easy-to-use convenient services that don\u0027t create those problems. And by the way, it\u0027s not just an elderly question, if we look at the largest proportion of calls to our help lines are actually from people in the age bracket of 18 to 25, because a lot of how government agencies design services, even Estonia, isn\u0027t really built for how Gen Z, which only uses mobile devices, which has a different expectation of user experience, how they\u0027re used to using services. So it\u0027s not always the case that younger means that they have an easier time using a service. But for the elderly, you\u0027re never gonna hit 100 percent. You\u0027re always going to have people with enough cognitive or sensory impairment that they really can\u0027t use a service, you\u0027re going to have people who just refuse to use a service, and we don\u0027t force citizens to use digital services, there is always an in-person or paper alternative. But it becomes a numbers game. The more you can move people into the online and automated channels, the more you can take the resources that you would use for in-person interactions to actually make the interaction for the complex cases work better. The idea is not that we move everyone into digitization, but that if we can move 80-20 or 90-10—the vast majority—into digitized automated channels, then we use the resources we have to then deal with the other 5 or the 10 percent in a way that actually pays more attention to their needs and gives them better outcomes.Gideon Lichfield: Right. So it seems like one of the big shifts that is happening at the moment in Estonia is a move to proactive public services, the idea that if you\u0027re entitled to some benefit, you shouldn\u0027t have to apply for it, it should just appear automatically. Where do you expect that to end up?\nLuukas Ilves: The idea is really quite simple, which is that the triggering conditions for most public services are written in the law somewhere. It can be anything from as mundane as, well, your passport needs to be renewed, to something a bit more sophisticated like means-testing for a public benefit. And if we know that we have the data that determine whether you are entitled to a benefit or should be using some kind of a service, then we\u0027re kind of sitting on our hands if we don\u0027t reach out to you when those data or those events indicate something should be happening. So the basic idea is just—it\u0027s a convenience point, it\u0027s as simple as me getting an SMS saying, “Hey, your passport\u0027s gonna expire in two months, here is a link to renew it.” But as you then start going through more complex events and services, you get into situations where you\u0027re notifying people of benefits that they weren\u0027t aware they\u0027re eligible for, you might in particular be focusing on disadvantaged populations where the information about the availability of these benefits isn\u0027t really there. Or you\u0027re pushing out things like, for instance, in the case of Covid, where we had additional unemployment benefits and then health benefits and support also for enterprises, you\u0027re going to the people that these benefits are meant to target without waiting for them to come to you, which should be contributing to actually achieving the desired outcome—the reason for which those benefits or those targeted forms of support were created in the first place—more effectively.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. I mean, it seems kind of obvious. And yet in most places around the world, it\u0027s assumed that if you want something from the government, you have to ask for it.\nLuukas Ilves: Yeah. And there may still be asking for it, I have to ask to have my passport renewed. But why shouldn\u0027t the government tell you that, “Hey, you can ask for it.” Wouldn\u0027t you like to ask for it? Because again, all of these various forms of benefits and services, ostensibly they exist because they\u0027re in the public good and because the lawmaker wants them to be used. So if we\u0027re kind of funding something, we\u0027re creating a legal framework and then we\u0027re just failing to tell our users that it\u0027s out there, it\u0027s really sort of doing 95 percent of the work and then failing in the last 5 percent.\nGideon Lichfield: Let\u0027s talk about online voting. This year, Estonians voted, and for the first time, more than half the votes were cast online. Tell us, first of all, how that online voting system works, what makes it secure?","tags":["","HAVE A NICE FUTURE","PODCASTS","GOVERNMENT"],"author":"BY GIDEON LICHFIELD","creation_date":"2023-10-18"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ethereum-shanghai-update-crypto-rift/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Ether is finally untethering itself from mining—and driving renewed debate about bitcoin’s environmental impact.","title":"Ethereum’s Shanghai Update Opens a Rift in Crypto","detailed_content":"AT 19:27 EASTERN time on April 12, the Ethereum blockchain, home to the world’s second-most-popular cryptocurrency, ether, will finally sever its links to crypto mining. Within the Ethereum bubble, a sense of anticipation is building; some are planning “viewing parties” for the occasion. Codenamed “Shanghai,” the update to Ethereum caps off a process, after “The Merge,” which fundamentally changes the way transactions are verified and the network secured. \nUnder the old system, proof-of-work (PoW) mining, the right to process a batch of transactions and earn a crypto reward is determined by a race to solve a mathematical puzzle. The greater the computing power miners throw at the problem, the greater their chance of winning the race. Under Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake (PoS) system, there is no race and there are no miners; instead, the winner is determined by raffle. The greater the amount of ether somebody locks up on the network—or stakes—the greater the chance they hold a prize-winning ticket.\nBy demonstrating that a large-scale blockchain can shift from one system to another, Shanghai will reignite a debate over whether the practice of mining that still supports bitcoin, the most widely traded cryptocurrency, is viable and sustainable. Figures from the University of Cambridge suggest the Bitcoin network consumed 107 terawatt-hours of energy in 2022—equivalent to that of the Netherlands—of which only just over a quarter came from renewable sources. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum consumed roughly two-thirds as much energy as the Bitcoin network. But the move away from mining has cut that consumption, according to analysis by Alex de Vries, data scientist at De Nederlandsche Bank and creator of Digiconomist, a source of crypto emissions data, by at least 99.84 percent.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\n“The energy consumption problem is Bitcoin’s achilles heel,” says de Vries. “It’s a simple fact that as the price of bitcoin gets higher, the energy consumption problem gets worse. The more money miners make, the more they will typically spend on resources: hardware and electricity.\nBut many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And, they say, PoS is inferior to PoW—prone to centralization (crypto’s great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces, like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of crypto.\nIn bitcoin’s infancy, the cryptocurrency could be mined effectively with just a personal computer and simple software. But as the level of appetite for bitcoin increased, the industry professionalized. Today, the mining scene is dominated by large companies—some publicly traded, like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain—that operate gargantuan facilities with rack upon rack of hardware. The largest of these mines, many of which are located in Texas, can draw upwards of 700 MW of power.But bitcoin proponents claim that looking at the absolute amount of energy that the industry consumes misses important context. Far from triggering investment in new fossil-fuel plants, miners say they are incentivizing renewable energy development, by plugging the gaps when demand is low.\n“Only the miners with the cheapest energy can survive, so bitcoin is driven to areas of low or no demand,” says Yan Pritzker, cofounder of the bitcoin trading platform Swan Bitcoin. “Sources of wind and solar are unreliable and therefore have to be overprovisioned. But bitcoin miners are coming in and acting as a buyer of last resort.”\nBy purchasing energy from renewable sources when it isn’t needed by the grid, the argument goes, bitcoin miners can increase the profitability of solar and wind farms and accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources. Miners also say consumption figures like those compiled by the University of Cambridge don’t take into account the amount of off-grid energy sources used to power mining, nor the circa 1 percent that run on methane—a byproduct of oil extraction that is otherwise vented or burned away.\nA common argument among bitcoiners is that rather than focusing on trying to cut down how much energy is consumed by the network, critics should look at how the network can help expand the amount of renewable energy on the grid. “Bitcoiners understand that the way to reduce emissions is not to use less energy, but to generate orders of magnitude more low-emissions electricity,” says Chris Bendiksen, bitcoin research lead at investment firm CoinShares. “In order to do that, producing low-emission energy must be profitable, something that PoW mining ensures in a wholly unique manner and at scale.”\nAlthough compelling at a surface level, these arguments do not stand up to scrutiny, say bitcoin critics. Pete Howson, an assistant professor on the Environmental Sciences faculty at Northumbria University, likens the common defenses of bitcoin mining to “magic tricks\u0027\u0027—sleights of hand that obscure inconvenient truths and “provide the illusion of clean and profitable investment.”\n“The only difference between flaring methane and flaring methane for bitcoin,” says Howson, “is that the latter makes fossil-fuel companies more profitable, slowing the transition to green alternatives.” There are even a handful of examples—in New York and Montana—of the additional revenue generated by bitcoin mining giving new life to fossil-fuel plants that had either closed or were scheduled for closure.\nMeanwhile, in countries like Iceland, Howson says, bitcoin miners are outcompeting other energy consumers, like recycling plants, which “can’t get access” to otherwise plentiful sources of renewable energy. “There is no such thing as wasting energy sustainably,” he says.\nWhether it’s really a waste is at the core of the debate.\nThe scrutiny of bitcoin’s environmental credentials, says Pritzker, is out of proportion with the emissions it produces, which best estimates place somewhere between 0.1 percent to 0.15 percent of the global total. He asks why bitcoin is singled out, when other industries pollute in larger volumes or are powered by a dirtier mix of energy. The simple answer is that the argument hinges on a matter of personal opinion; it comes down to whether somebody believes that crypto serves a purpose.If bitcoin is agreed to be of greater societal value than tobacco, say, an industry responsible for a greater volume of emissions, its footprint becomes easier to justify. But if instead, bitcoin is just one big Ponzi scheme, the sums will never line up.\nThis ideological battle, and the strength of the animosity between bitcoin evangelists and their critics, means that it’s hard to have a nuanced discussion about the industry, and both sides have become entrenched in their positions.\nAccording to de Vries, it would be perfectly possible, from a technical perspective, for Bitcoin to follow in the footsteps of the Ethereum network. “Bitcoin could move to PoS, no problem,” he says. “But it’s a social challenge.”\nDe Vries is often attacked by bitcoiners, who claim he is incentivized by his affiliation with central banking to criticize bitcoin, that his data is incorrect, and that he fails to account for the nuances in bitcoin’s relationship with the environment.\nBitcoiners have locked horns with environmental charities. On March 23, activists at Greenpeace unveiled an art installation named the Skull of Satoshi, an allusion to the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Standing 11 feet tall, the skull is decorated with old motherboards, its eye sockets glow red, and chimneys eject smoke from the crown. The installation was intended to represent the dual contribution of crypto mining to carbon emissions and e-waste, says Rolf Skar, campaign director at Greenpeace USA. But the skull was quickly appropriated by bitcoin supporters on Twitter, who described the skull as “metal” and “badass.” Some used it as a new profile picture. \n“The reaction was predictable, but disappointing,” says Skar. “It’s not surprising, but it’s a bad look to trivialize these very real issues.”\nThe artist that designed the sculpture, Benjamin Von Wong, bore some of the backlash too. On March 25, he published a Twitter thread saying that he had revised his “black and white” assessment after conversations with bitcoiners. But he also pointed to the forces standing in the way of productive debate: “There are people on both sides who believe the other is naively optimistic, misguided and misinformed,” he wrote.\nThe Skull of Satoshi, which is being taken on a tour of US cities, is part of a broader Greenpeace campaign called “Change the Code, Not the Climate,” the purpose of which is to push for changes in the Bitcoin code base that would reduce the network’s emissions. Skar says the intention is to prevent fossil-fuel plants from “roaring back to life,” courtesy of bitcoin, but Bendiksen calls the effort a “smear campaign.”\nBoth parties also accuse the other of bad-faith misrepresentations of facts and data. The Greenpeace campaign, Pritzker and Bendiksen say, is funded in part by Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple, a company with interests in promoting XRP, a cryptocurrency that was launched as a direct competitor to bitcoin. But by the same token, says Howson, arguments in favor of bitcoin mining are often founded on data supplied by the Bitcoin Mining Council, a coalition of mining companies led by Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, a business with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in bitcoin.The impasse is worsened by the ideological opposition to PoS among bitcoiners, separate from the environmental considerations. Some find unthinkable the idea of tampering with Satoshi Nakamoto’s original invention, and others, like Bendiksen and Pritzker, believe PoS introduces greater risk of centralization and censorship—and therefore represents a threat to crypto’s founding principles. “PoS is essentially the fiat system,” says Pritzker, “because whoever has the gold makes the rules.” For this reason, explains Bendiksen, bitcoiners will “never agree” to a shift.\n“Any attack on bitcoin is an attack on their morality, values, and often their net worth. This makes everything feel personal,” Von Wong told WIRED. “Because most people don’t see themselves as intrinsically bad, they feel misjudged and misunderstood, which is a terrible place to start a conversation.”\nThe result is a situation in which both parties lob insults across the void but register none of the legitimate or well-intentioned complaints. Any morsel of information that might be used to discredit the opposition is also seized upon. And Von Wong worries about becoming a morsel himself.\n“The hardest part about being in the center of a controversy is feeling like a chess piece,” he says. “I don’t feel like I can speak freely in public without someone, somewhere, taking what I say out of context and trying to leverage it against the opposite side.”","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","ETHEREUM","ENVIRONMENT"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2023-04-10"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/faruk-ozer-turkey-crypto-fraud/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","title":"He Emptied an Entire Crypto Exchange Onto a Thumb Drive. Then He Disappeared","detailed_content":"FARUK FATIH ÖZER stood in front of a passport control officer at Istanbul Airport, a line of impatient travelers queuing behind him. He pulled his face mask below his chin for the security camera. Surely he was nervous. The 27-year-old had unruly black hair, a boy-band face, and a patchy beard. Normally he overcompensated for his callow features by dressing in a pressed three-piece suit. But this spring day he wore black trainers and a navy-blue sweater hastily pulled over a white polo shirt, as if he had dressed in a dash. A small backpack was slung over his right shoulder. He looked like someone who could have been going on a last-minute day trip—or someone planning to never come back. At 5:57 pm on April 20, 2021, the guard stamped his Turkish passport and Özer shuffled through the crowd to Gate C, a flash drive containing a rumored $2 billion in crypto stashed in his belongings.\nAfter Özer’s plane reached Tirana, Albania, at 9:24 that night, he checked into the Mondial, a popular 4-star business hotel in the capital’s commercial district. A couple of days later, he looked at his social media accounts. A mob was very angry with him: Customers couldn’t access their money on the exchange Thodex, where he was founder and CEO, and people were accusing him of absconding with their funds.\nÖzer posted a public letter to his company’s website and his social accounts. “I feel compelled to make this statement in order to respond urgently to these allegations,” he wrote. The accusations weren’t true, he said. Thodex—which had nearly half a million investors and $500 million in daily trade volume—was investigating what Özer claimed was a suspected cyberattack that caused “an abnormal fluctuation in the company account.” Assets would be frozen for five days while Thodex resolved the issue. This was terribly bad timing for the big business deal he said he was en route to make: selling the company, or so he had told some employees and his brother and sister before he left. All would be made right. “There will be no victims,” he promised. “I personally declare that I will return to Turkey within a few days and ensure that the facts are revealed in cooperation with judicial authorities and that I will do my best to prevent users from suffering.” Of course, there was this possibility too: He was in the midst of pulling off the biggest heist in Turkey’s history.\nPHOTOGRAPH: GETTY IMAGESBefore dawn the day after Özer posted the letter, police squads fanned out across Istanbul and public prosecutors opened an investigation. Law enforcement arrested 62 people, including Thodex employees at all levels of the company—and Özer’s older brother and sister, Güven and Serap. Interpol issued a red notice, a request for law enforcement worldwide to find and “provisionally arrest” Özer pending his extradition to Turkey. Search teams deployed across Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia. There were reported sightings of the dark-haired young man across Tirana, rumors that he had gone to a poultry farm, that an executive from the Albanian football league was sheltering him. Soon, the Albanian police arrested people accused of aiding and abetting him. But no one seemed to know exactly where Özer was.\nBackgammon cafés, where old men have been drinking tea and talking politics for centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip.\nÖzer had vanished at a particularly precarious time in crypto’s annals: In the weeks leading up to his disappearance, so-called rug pulls—when a cryptocurrency exchange or altcoin developer absconds with investors’ funds—had crypto investors around the globe flabbergasted. The CEO of Mirror Trading International, a crypto trading company based in South Africa, defrauded users of more than $1 billion, then skipped town; TurtleDex, an anonymous decentralized finance storage project on Binance, reportedly vanished with $2.4 million; another decentralized finance project, Meerkat, reportedly fleeced investors out of $31 million (of which they paid back 95 percent). Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis ranked rug pulls as the primary scam of 2021, accounting for 37 percent of all cryptocurrency scam revenue that year, up from 1 percent the year before.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nThodex was at the top of that roster, and nearly every major outlet from Bloomberg to Newsweek published headlines like “Turkish Crypto Exchange Goes Bust as Founder Flees Country” and “Turkish Cryptocurrency Founder Faruk Fatih Özer Seen Fleeing Country With Suspected $2 Billion From Investors.” CoinGeek called it “the biggest scam in the digital asset industry in 2021.” The New York Times’ headline read, “Possible Cryptocurrency Fraud Is Another Blow to Turkey’s Financial Stability.” In Turkey, the country I now call home, people were reeling: For years, crypto had been built up—largely by Özer but by others too—as a way out of economic volatility. Now it seemed like just another way to lose your life savings. But something felt off to me, like the whole story wasn’t being told.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRFaruk was born in February 1994, the youngest of three. He was inseparable from his brother, Güven, and sister, Serap. They grew up camping, playing video games, and cooking together. Friends always pointed out their shared sense of humor. His parents ran a print and copy shop in the city of Kocaeli, down the street from their house. They were observant Muslims who gave their children meaningful names: “trust” (Güven), “mirage” (Serap), and “the one who distinguishes between right and wrong” (Faruk).\nKocaeli is an industrial port town about 100 kilometers east of Istanbul surrounded by a checkerboard of tobacco and sugar beet fields, petrochemical plants, and paper mills. Roman emperors once lived there, and their crumbling fortress walls still wind through the landscape. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed, Kocaeli became a manufacturing boomtown, and its residents muscled the newly minted Republic of Turkey into the Industrial Revolution.\nWhen Özer was born, Turkey’s economy was in a tailspin. A fragile financial system, irresponsible borrowing, and political corruption had triggered a brief period of triple-digit inflation. The lira’s volatility threatened the savings of its entire population. So many people moved their domestic assets to foreign-currency deposits that, by the end of the year, an astonishing 50 percent of bank deposits in Turkey were in a foreign currency. The year before, that figure was just 1 percent.\nThat same month Özer was born, a charismatic orator with a sympathetic gaze and push-broom mustache began campaigning through Istanbul’s streets in a paisley kipper tie. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan railed against the secular elite who had led the country to near economic collapse. A devout Muslim, he walked the streets of his home neighborhood, Kasımpaşa, a hardscrabble district where he grew up selling simit, or sesame bread, promising reform. In an upset election, he coasted into the role of mayor of Istanbul.\nAround the same time, two Turkish business moguls launched Turkcell, the nation’s first mobile communication system. (This was a year and a half before the same technology was released in the US.) By 2003, Erdoğan was elected prime minister, kicking off a decade of unprecedented growth that foreign observers called Turkey’s “Silent Revolution.” In a turn away from his predecessors, he governed through the lens of a businessman, inaugurating a massive building boom across the country and ultimately wrangling Turkey’s rampant inflation. His pro-business rhetoric boosted the middle class and set Turkey on a path to European Union membership.\nÖzer also caught the spirit of entrepreneurship at an early age. As a teenager in the mid-aughts, he worked after-school shifts at his parents’ print shop. “Ever since I was a child, I wanted to do my own business, no matter what sector it was,” he said. At the end of his second year in high school, he decided that further study would not lead him to that dream, so he dropped out.\nBy 2013, Turkey’s gross domestic product had nearly tripled, the lira hovered just above the dollar, and the country was negotiating entry into the EU. BtcTurk, Turkey’s first crypto exchange (and reportedly the world’s fourth), was preparing to launch. Then, in May of that year, a group of activists gathered at Gezi Park in Istanbul to protest plans to redevelop it into a shopping mall with Ottoman-era architecture. They bridled not only at the loss of green space but also at the glorification of Turkey’s Islamist past in a society that called itself secular. Police brutally cracked down on the protesters, sparking a nationwide movement. Within weeks, more than 3 million people had taken part in the demonstrations, their frustration now encompassing the growing authoritarianism of Erdoğan’s government. Thousands were injured, and at least five died. Özer had just turned 19. In the following years, Erdoğan tossed a record number of journalists in jail and censored the internet, and foreign investors recoiled.Around that time, Ismail H. Polat, an expert in engineering, information tech, and new media, was the first person to cover crypto on his YouTube channel. Now a lecturer at Istanbul’s Kadir Has University, the way he tells it, crypto was about trying to be financially free. In those early days, he says, “it was not the coin, but the spirit.” (After all, bitcoin was worth only $77 at the time.) For young people who felt that Erdoğan had pulled the rug out from under them, whether they knew it explicitly or not, crypto was a new way to protest.\nAt the same time, Özer’s generation was watching as tech startups were taking off around the world. Facebook had bought Instagram for $1 billion, and that spurred entrepreneurs to begin churning out apps. A lot of them were gaming-focused; Candy Crush brought in $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013. The Özers took note.\nBy then, Turkcell had become one of the world’s largest companies. Turkey’s mobile infrastructure and smartphone adoption rate became one of the fastest growing in the world. Polat credits this as the foundation for what came next: The dream began to shift from mere employment to entrepreneurship. Güven cofounded a company called Inline Yazılım; Faruk started one called Inline Teknoloji a few years later and another called Game Bridge after that. The brothers figured out how to crank out chintzy apps—cut-and-paste washboard abs for Instagram photos (pre-vanity-filters era) and addictive gambling games. “I started to sell almost every product that I thought could make a profit on the internet,” he told me. “This is how I took my first step into business life.”\nBY 2017, 14 years into Erdoğan’s rule, Turkey’s economy had come full circle. Erdoğan’s unorthodox economic policies—repeatedly cutting interest rates—were supposed to raise investment and make Turkey less dependent on foreign powers. Instead they led the country into an economic crisis; the value of the lira hit the skids, and after a failed coup attempt in 2016 people figured it would only get worse. Just as they had 23 years earlier, citizens began searching for places to shelter their money. Voilà, 2017 was also the first year bitcoin’s value shot sky high, from $9,000 to $20,000. Global trade volume also skyrocketed from $99 million to $16 billion.\nBeing early investors in tech wasn’t something that had historically been available to the average person in Turkey. The instant millionaires and billionaires and unicorns pretty much lived elsewhere. Now, Faruk Özer saw a possibility. People in Turkey could shelter their money in what was clearly going to be the next big tech boom. But the biggest opportunity wasn’t in trading coins—it was in running a cryptocurrency exchange. Exchanges collect people’s money and, for a commission, invest it; that gives people who don’t have the time or skills to invest directly into the blockchain a pathway to crypto. Users who go through an exchange don’t even have their own digital wallets; their money is stored until they withdraw it. (Hence the industry warning: “Not your wallet, not your coins.”)","tags":["","LONGREADS","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FRAUD","CRIME"],"author":"BY JENNA SCATENA","creation_date":"2024-04-02"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/fentanyl-ingredients-chinese-labs-cryptocurrency/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"And it\u0027s happening in plain sight.","title":"Chinese Labs Are Selling Fentanyl Ingredients for Millions in Crypto","detailed_content":"FENTANYL HAS LONG been one of the most dangerous wares of the underworld cryptocurrency economy—so dangerous, in fact, that even many dark-web markets have banned it.

Rather than getting lost in its unknowns, instead focus on its underpinning technologies...","title":"How to Think About ‘the Metaverse’","detailed_content":"THE METAVERSE IS a fuzzy concept. It’s generally taken to be a vision for a future internet comprising a network of virtual experiences. But there are differing takes on what this might look like. Most versions of the idea feature certain key technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and virtual worlds – but do conventional devices such as PCs also have a role to play? Would the virtual worlds be interoperable? Is blockchain core to the idea or just a sideshow? And is this prediction for the future of the web even likely to happen in the first place?\nThe fuzziness is compounded by the word itself. It was coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash, where the metaverse was an alternate, digital reality. When the word was appropriated by Silicon Valley around two years ago, its usage was generally aligned with Stephenson’s idea. But, since then, it has broadened almost to the point of meaninglessness. \nSo, how should business leaders approach this subject? Here’s a suggestion. Rather than getting lost trying to untangle the competing definitions and assess the likelihood of the grand forecasts, it can be helpful to go back to basics. The metaverse might be a nebulous concept, but it encompasses technologies and ideas that are real things in the here and now. Separating out those component parts, assessing them on their own terms and considering whether they may have relevance for the organisation – regardless of whether \u0027the metaverse\u0027 happens – can prove fruitful. Here are five key areas to follow…\nVirtual reality\nWhen most people talk about the metaverse, the group of technologies they have in mind typically includes VR. This is an immersive digital experience achieved using a headset with near-eye displays and motion tracking. VR can be used with a variety of media – innovations such as 360-degree cameras, for instance, allow live action films to be shot for VR – but in the metaverse context it is most associated with exploring virtual worlds. \nThe earliest such computer-generated environments were the text-based games of the 1970s, such as Colossal Cave Adventure, in which the software describes the surroundings and narrates the action. As computers became more sophisticated, so did the virtual worlds these games could conjure. Text turned to graphics – initially 2D, later 3D – and then they shifted online. As this happened, virtual worlds came to be used for purposes other than what might be strictly understood as gaming. Platforms emerged where users could collaboratively create content, for example, and game worlds morphed into social spaces where users might gather in large groups to watch a digital concert as much as fight out a battle royale. This has led to a recent proliferation of virtual realms encompassing everything from brand-built experiences to purpose-built ‘alternate reality’ platforms. Many are simply accessed over a computer or phone in the conventional manner, but a number of these offer VR support and some commentators expect this to become increasingly commonplace. “This will be a game changer,” says Sam Hamilton, creative director of Decentraland, a browser-based virtual world. “Virtual worlds work best when people are fully immersed in them, and only then will digital life feel more like a human experience.”So, what else does the future likely hold for VR? Beyond hardware improvements (see below), two trends stand out. One is the ability to support ever larger numbers of simultaneous users in the same virtual environment. Right now, technical constraints mean hosting more than around 100 users without trade-offs in functionality is a challenge, but improvements in computing power are starting to change that. The other trend is the rise of hardware that can capture data from the physical world – satellites, 3D scanners – and feed this into a digital environment. Some speculate this could lead to computer-generated simulations looking increasingly like reality. \nHow is this changing business?\nCommercial activities in virtual worlds typically centre around brand marketing and selling virtual goods. As for VR more broadly, organisations are experimenting in a variety of ways, albeit cautiously. For the entertainment industry, say, VR is a new potential revenue stream – and not just for gaming. The NBA broadcasts basketball live in VR, allowing users to watch the action as if they were sitting courtside. The remote audience is represented as digital avatars; viewers can move around the ‘venue’ and interact with each other.\nIt’s not just about consumer applications. Whether it’s meetings, co-working or onboarding, a range of traditional ‘back end’ business activities are being trialled in VR. Meta Horizon Workrooms, for example, integrates meeting rooms, video calls and presentation tools. Some believe VR experiences improve on the conventional approach. If the creative team at a car company is collaborating on a new design, for example, being able to view it in VR can aid understanding. Or consider training, which can be made safer in a simulation – if you’re learning to operate a crane, say, the stakes are much higher in real life. VR can also enable new forms of learning. Taking apart a virtual model of the machinery you’re being taught how to fix is arguably more compelling than studying a 2D diagram.\nAugmented reality\nThe idea of bridging the physical and virtual worlds is central to the metaverse conversation, which is why augmented reality is seen as a core technology. But the concept of using screens to overlay digital content on the real world has been around for decades. Consider the ‘head-up displays’ long used by fighter pilots to view flight data without having to look down at instruments. But it wasn’t until the smartphone hit its stride in the late 2000s that augmented reality came into its own. The combination of portable high-definition screen, web connection, fast processor and integrated camera has enabled a wave of AR apps that turn the phone into a ‘window’ for mediating the physical world. Many of the use cases are practical: replacing foreign language text with a translation, or previewing how a piece of furniture might look in your home. But AR is also being used for entertainment, allowing users to view geolocated digital artworks, add filters to social video posts, and play games that place characters in the world around them. \nSome futurists predict that AR devices – mobile phones but also emergent wearables such as AR glasses – will eventually come to incorporate 3D scanners and powerful graphics chips. These could rapidly map the dimensions of the physical environment relative to the device and overlay reality with a richness and seamlessness that is currently impossible. This is often referred to as ‘mixed reality’ – ‘true AR’ – where the physical and digital worlds are blurred in a manner that is completely persuasive. Imagine walking down the road wearing AR glasses, for example, and seeing present day London re-skinned as a William Gibson-style cyberpunk city. How broad are the use cases?\nAugmented reality is not just focussed on consumers. Use cases are emerging across a range of domains, from industrial maintenance to military logistics. A particularly promising area is medicine. A number of start-ups offer dedicated AR-based medical devices and some doctors are already using these as a matter of course. Take Dr. Timothy Witham, professor of neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery at Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Since 2020, he has been using an AR headset made by Chicago-based company Augmedics to assist with inserting spinal instrumentation – screws and rods – during spinal surgery. \n“The spinal cord and nerve roots are literally millimeters next to where you\u0027re putting in these screws, which demands very high accuracy and precision,” says Witham. Traditionally, he would rely on X-rays and his understanding of anatomy to insert those items freehand. The view through Augmedics’ headset, however, overlays the spine with the patient’s CT scan imagery – a little like X-ray vision. “When we\u0027re going to put a screw in, I can see exactly where it\u0027s going with millimetre accuracy,” he says. “This technology is about 98 percent accurate, which compares favourably to any other method for doing this.” \nWitham believes augmented reality holds significant potential not only for other types of spinal procedure – he has successfully trialed it for removing spinal tumours – but also for other areas of medicine. “Eventually it will spill over into other disciplines, I\u0027m confident about that,” he says. “I think it will be applicable to removing brain tumours in the future, and I do think it will have applications in other types of surgery such as orthopaedics and abdominal surgery.”\nHardware\nThe range of hardware that falls under the metaverse umbrella is broad. It spans everything from regular smartphones and computers, on the basis that these can be used to access virtual worlds, through to motion-tracking wearables for operating avatars. But the device category that most people have in mind is dedicated headsets for AR and VR. Over the past decade and a half, there has been a renewed interest in developing this hardware among tech companies such as Meta – and other major players are rumoured to be entering this market in the near future. The ambition is to create affordable, powerful, small headsets that can offer a high-definition experience. Those who believe that ‘the metaverse’ is the future of the internet foresee this hardware becoming so compelling that it comes to enjoy mass market, smartphone-level adoption globally.\nShould businesses expect this shift any time soon?Headsets are still evolving, and their prices are still high. This, in turn, has stunted the predicted boom in VR and AR adoption. That’s because this hardware represents an almighty technical challenge: it has to operate within many technical constraints yet be more capable than even the most powerful games console. A major issue is miniaturisation: packing a broad range of systems into a small space – motion trackers, cameras, high-resolution displays – alongside the required processing power and battery life to render high-quality graphics on the fly. This is not only a computing problem, it’s also a manufacturing problem, because it can’t be solved by combining off-the-shelf components. Much has to be made from scratch. \n“AR eyewear has more challenges than VR,” says Simon Windsor, co-founder of Dimension Studio, which makes volumetric content for major brands. “If you want to re-skin the world around you – for virtual content to genuinely and believably coexist in our physical world – you\u0027re reliant on performant eyewear, you\u0027re reliant on computer vision, you\u0027re reliant on compute, graphics and connectivity. There\u0027s lots of technologies, which are required to synchronise to provide a seamless and compelling experience. We don’t have those capabilities in an optimal form yet.”\nAvatars\nAn avatar is a graphical representation of a human that allows them to interact with other users and the virtual world around them. Indeed, more than a billion Meta avatars have now been created. The word itself comes from Hinduism, meaning the ‘descent’ of a god to Earthly form, but was first used in the contemporary sense in 1985 with the game, Ultima IV: Quest Of The Avatar. Rabindra Ratan, an associate professor who studies avatars at Michigan State University, says that there are three main types, although they do overlap. First, avatars that are simply tools for performing tasks – you probably think of your car in a driving game as a utilitarian object more than ‘you’. Secondly, avatars as social others – when you play as Mario, you likely see him as having a different identity and narrative from your own. Finally, the avatar as ‘me’ – you identify with the avatar as a self-representation. “In most metaverse conversations, we\u0027re thinking about this latter usage,” says Ratan. “Though, of course, you might represent yourself differently from who you really are.” \nIndeed, avatar aesthetics range from the anthropomorphic to the fantastical, and can be further adapted with clothes and accessories. New generative AI tools are making it easier to create all kinds of avatars, notably ones that can imitate the user with uncanny photorealism. The reason many virtual world platforms opt for low-fi or cartoonish avatars is to reduce processing requirements, but this constraint may lift as Moore’s Law takes its course.In terms of the future, Ratan is particularly excited about “the potential for ownership over a single avatar that could be used across multiple digital contexts”, adding that it could nevertheless adapt its look to specific situations – more formal for work purposes, say, more expressive for social purposes. “That would let us feel even more identification with the avatar, and I think the locus of identity for humans will start to shift once we can do this.” People may feel more authentically represented by their avatar than their real self, he says – especially if augmented reality glasses let others view us re-skinned as an avatar in the real world. “But that’s an even further future direction.”\nWhy is this relevant to businesses? \nRight now, business applications centre on helping people create avatars and selling digital clothing. For companies exploring digital fashion, the notion of a future where an avatar can represent you consistently across multiple virtual experiences is an exciting one. That’s because it implies a degree of interoperability between virtual experiences. If that becomes possible, then it seems reasonable to think that those digital belongings may be able to move with the avatar. This would give customers a greater reason to buy those items, and also presents brands with a bigger marketing opportunity.\nIn years to come, other kinds of opportunities may arise outside of the bounds of virtual worlds themselves. If AI enables photoreal, ‘digital twin’ avatars become widespread, for instance, fashion retailers could use these to let customers preview e-commerce purchases of physical items.\nNFTs\nA non-fungible token (NFT) is a record on a blockchain that certifies ownership of a digital asset, such as an artwork. The idea took off in the developer community in the mid-2010s, and gained wider popularity in 2017 through online games based around trading NFTs. Since then, independent creators and major businesses alike have sold everything from digital wearables to music as NFTs – and the marketplace has been on a rollercoaster. At its peak in 2021, NFT artworks were being auctioned for tens of millions of dollars. But as crypto markets tanked over the course of 2022, so did the market for NFTs.\nNevertheless, NFTs still feature prominently in metaverse discourse because a virtual economy relies on being able to prove ownership of digital files, and also because an NFT establishes scarcity and, therefore, value. If there are only 10 NFTs for an artwork, it constrains perceived supply of an infinitely copyable asset.How are brands using NFTs?\nNFTs have been used as rewards in games, membership cards and loyalty program points. Generally, however, brands are gravitating towards two main applications: virtual art and virtual clothing. Virtual fashion platform RTFKT, for instance, made headlines two years ago when it sold 620 pairs of digital trainers for $3.1 million in seven minutes. It has since been acquired by Nike. \nWhat do people get wrong about NFTs?\nNFTs are freighted with misapprehensions. Although the term is often used to refer to the virtual objects over which you have ownership, an NFT is technically just a digital record on a blockchain. That record is associated with your unique crypto wallet ID and includes a link to the digital file in question, which is hosted externally. This establishes provenance, sure, but let’s be clear: that file is not itself ‘stored on the blockchain’. The digital assets themselves are thus more vulnerable than many believe. It’s also a common misconception that these files can be ported with ease between different digital platforms.\nWhy are people buying NFTs?\nClearly, much of the market is driven by speculation. But Benoit Pagotto, founder of RTFKT, says that’s not the whole story. “For sure, a lot of people are doing it initially for investment, but then they realise they have become part of a community. I think that’s what makes people stay in the end. They have a sense of belonging to something greater than themselves, which is I believe a cultural revolution powered by blockchain technology in the background. And the thing with blockchain is it’s transparent – you can see what everyone is buying – so you can tell who is here to speculate and make money and who\u0027s here to collect and stay for the long run.” \nBut aren’t NFTs just a mechanism to create artificial scarcity? “There are lots of brands that could make a lot more output than they do – that controlled scarcity is just part of how you build your brand and your product. That’s true in the watch industry, the car industry, the diamond industry,” he says. “But on the digital side, we never had that option until now.”\nWhat’s happening at the cutting edge?\nThere’s an increasing interest in using NFTs to merge the physical and digital worlds. RTFKT sells physical trainers that contain NFC (near-field communication) chips. “We call them ‘World Merging chips’,” says Pagotto. The user scans the chip with their phone to acquire an NFT version of the shoes. “This helps authenticate the item. Counterfeiting is a big problem in the luxury industry. And these chips are opening a lot more possibilities of the future where, for example, we could do physical events where you can only enter if you have the physical sneakers with the chip inside.”\nThe future\nTechnology does not develop deterministically. No matter how much innovators attempt to will a technology into existence, it’s up to the market to decide if it wants it. What’s more, the evolution of technology is recursive rather than linear: new tools give rise to new behaviours which give rise to new use cases and therefore new technologies. These two factors make future gazing a precarious exercise. \nSome anticipate that the notion of the metaverse – if we still use that term in years to come – will eventually incorporate frontier technologies such as volumetric video screens (which show 3D images without the need for special glasses) and brain-computer interfaces (which let users operate computers via thought alone). This is clearly highly speculative. But so too are many of the forecasts we’ve been discussing. \nSo, where does this leave organisations who need to strategically plan for the future? Here are a few guiding principles. For one, keep time horizons short – trying to forecast beyond two or three years is practically impossible. For another, unless you need to be at the bleeding edge, look at what others are doing in the here and now, track those that innovate early, and learn from the mistakes of the early adopters. Finally, remember: the future belongs to those who not only can best weed out the signals from the noise, but who are most able to adapt when that future arrives – whatever form it may take. After all, the only certainty is change.\nLearn more about marketing in the metaverse on meta.com.\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","tags":["","BRAND LAB","PROMOTION"],"creation_date":"2023-05-17"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-crypto-investors-hardware-wallets/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The collapse of the exchange has pushed users back to “self-custody” products like Ledger.

A civil jury in the US has found he lied to investors.","title":"Crypto Magnate Do Kwon Found Liable for Multibillion-Dollar Fraud","detailed_content":"A federal jury in New York has found South Korean crypto magnate Do Kwon—and his company Terraform Labs—liable for defrauding investors who collectively sank billions of dollars into cryptoassets whose value later fell to near zero.\nFiled in February 2023 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a regulatory body responsible for protecting US investors, the civil complaint alleged that Kwon and Terraform had “perpetrated a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of $40 billion of market value,” whereby they lied to investors about the prospects and stability of the cryptotokens they issued.\nKwon, who went into hiding after the tokens crashed in 2022, is facing criminal charges in the United States and South Korea. He was recently released on bail from a prison in Montenegro, where he was arrested last year and awaits extradition.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nExpert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty - Blockchain\nIn Kwon’s absence, the jury in the US civil trial in the Southern District of New York heard evidence from investors who bought into Terraform tokens, whistleblowers from companies with which Terraform partnered, and other witnesses. After a deliberation lasting less than two hours, the jury found Kwon and Terraform liable on civil fraud charges related to making false claims and misleading investors in Terraform’s cryptotoken.\n“We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud,” said SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal in a statement. “For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people.”\nThe resolution of Kwon’s civil trial—along with the recent sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of fallen crypto exchange FTX—will help to draw a line under a traumatic period for the crypto industry, says market analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis Trading. “Many feel hurt by what Do Kwon did. Those that invested feel betrayed,” she says. “Hopefully, people will be reminded to do more homework and ask better questions, to avoid getting drawn into rather flimsy claims again.”\nKwon started Terraform in 2018, alongside cofounder Daniel Shin. By 2020, the company announced plans to launch a stablecoin called TerraUSD (UST), whose value would remain pegged to the US dollar, ostensibly providing holders with a refuge from the volatility of other crypto assets.\nStablecoins are typically held to a specific value by an underlying basket of assets—including cash and short-term government bonds—for which they can be redeemed at any time. But UST, claimed Terraform, would be pegged to its dollar value by way of a complex algorithm, tying it to a second coin issued by the firm known as LUNA. If the value of UST were ever to diverge from $1, traders would theoretically be incentivized to either buy or sell the stablecoin until the target value was restored.\nAt the height of its popularity, in early 2022, LUNA was among the 10 largest cryptocurrencies in the world by the combined value of coins in circulation—and UST wasn’t far behind. “It was an intriguing and very novel mechanism,” says Acheson. “Many smart people believed it would work.”In May 2022, it all went wrong. When holders of large amounts of UST sold the token in bulk, it slipped from its dollar peg, leading to panic and a broader sell-off that drove the price practically to zero. LUNA and Terraform’s other coins were decimated along with it. “The mechanism was based on the faulty assumption that people would want it to self-correct and therefore it would,” says Acheson. “[Kwon] made marketing claims about the stability of stablecoins that weren’t true.”\nThe incident sent crypto markets into a downward spiral and catalyzed a chain reaction that brought a string of crypto companies to their knees. The failure of Terraform’s tokens contributed to the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in June, followed by crypto lenders Voyager Digital, then BlockFi, then Genesis—and, in a roundabout way, FTX too.\nAfter the incident, Kwon fled Singapore, where Terraform was headquartered, for Dubai and then Serbia. He was later apprehended by authorities in Montenegro, where he was sentenced to four months in prison for attempting to leave the country on a fake Costa Rican passport. The kind of “hubris” displayed by Kwon, says Acheson, “has been part of the crypto ecosystem for some time.”\nThe SEC’s case was built around two core allegations: First, that Kwon and Terraform had misled investors about the capacity for UST to restore itself to a dollar valuation—to self-heal—without intervention; and second, that they had lied about Chai, a large Korean payments firm founded by Shin, utilizing Terraform technology to conduct its operations, leaving investors with an unmerited confidence in the prospect of widespread adoption.\nIn May 2021, after UST had fallen from its peg for the first time, the SEC alleged, Kwon struck a secret deal with trading firm Jump Trading, which agreed to purchase the token in large volumes until its value was restored to the target level. At trial, a whistleblower who had worked as a software developer at Jump Trading testified to that effect. (During the SEC investigation, the president of Jump’s crypto trading division declined to comment in a deposition, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Jump has not been charged by the SEC.)\nAlmost as soon as Jump intervened to manually restore UST to its dollar valuation, the SEC claimed, Kwon and Terraform began to make misleading public statements, telling people the token “automatically self-heals” by design.\nA second SEC whistleblower, a former Chai executive, testified that the payments company did not process or settle transactions using Terraform technology, as Kwon had claimed. Instead, the SEC alleged, Terraform had artificially mirrored Chai transactions on its network to create the impression of legitimate traffic. It presented to the court messages between the two Terraform cofounders in which Kwon suggested they create “fake transactions that look real,” and promised to “try my best to make it indiscernible.”\nBoth strands of the SEC’s case were “extremely strong,” says Daniel Silva, a former US prosecutor and attorney at law firm Buchalter. “It’s easy when you have people lying. ‘Fraud’ is a fancy word, but really it’s just lying to gain property. And everyone understands lying is wrong—or at least that it can get you in trouble.”","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME","FRAUD"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2024-04-05"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/new-crypto-mixer-promises-to-be-tornado-cash-crime/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Privacy Pool’s founder says he can preserve users’ privacy while keeping money launderers and regulators at bay.","title":"A New Crypto Mixer Promises to Be Tornado Cash Without the Crime","detailed_content":"WHEN THE US government announced sanctions against Tornado Cash last August, the warning seemed to be aimed at all crypto mixers.

As it amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally, it openly told the United States government that, as an offshore operation, it didn\u0027t have to comply with the country\u0027s financial regulations and money-laundering laws.\nThen, late last month, those years of brushing off US regulators caught up with the company in the form of one the most punitive money-laundering criminal settlements in the history of the US Justice Department. The crackdown doesn\u0027t just mean a chastened Binance will have to change its practices going forward. It means that when the company is sentenced in a matter of months, it will be forced to open its past books to regulators, too. What was once a haven for anarchic crypto commerce is about to be transformed into the opposite: perhaps the most fed-friendly business in the cryptocurrency industry, retroactively offering more than a half-decade of users\u0027 transaction records to US regulators and law enforcement.\nWhen the Department of Justice announced on November 21 that Binance\u0027s executives had agreed to plead guilty to criminal money-laundering charges, much of the attention on that settlement focused on founder Changpeng Zhao giving up his CEO role and on the company\u0027s record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. But Binance\u0027s settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US Treasury Department also stipulate a strict new regime of data-sharing with law enforcement and regulators. The company has agreed to comply with regulators\u0027 \"requests for information\"—a term that carries none of the evidence or suspicion requirements necessary for obtaining a warrant or even a subpoena—to the point of producing any \"information, testimony, document, record, or other tangible evidence.\"\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nBinance has also agreed to scour all of its transactions from 2018 to 2022 and file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for anything it deems a potential violation of US law from that five-year period. That “SAR lookback” means the company will now be actively scrutinizing its customers in retrospect, not just passively assenting to regulators poring over its databases. Those SARs are collected by FinCEN, the Treasury Department\u0027s financial crimes division, but then made available to law enforcement agencies from the FBI to IRS Criminal Investigations to local police. And all of this new scrutiny will be overseen by a \"monitor\" firm chosen by the US government but paid by Binance—an in-house watchdog assigned to make sure Binance is complying in good faith.\n\"I don\u0027t think Binance\u0027s customers have the slightest clue of the ramifications of this plea and consent decree. It\u0027s unprecedented,\" says John Reed Stark, who spent 20 years as an attorney at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including as the founder of its Office of Internet Enforcement. “If they\u0027re a drug dealer or a terrorist or a child pornography peddler, they\u0027re going to get caught.\" He describes Binance\u0027s agreement as a \"24/7, 365-days-a-year financial colonoscopy.\"\nOne US prosecutor, who asked not to be named because they weren\u0027t authorized to speak to media about the case, calls the degree of access to Binance\u0027s records described in the agreement \"kind of crazy,\" and remains in disbelief at the idea of Binance abiding by the settlement. \"I don\u0027t know what kind of business would want to operate while allowing that much government oversight, especially one that\u0027s deliberately stayed out of the US so that they\u0027re not under our nose,\" they say. \"The other option must have been really bad.\"If Binance does comply, however, the prosecutor adds that \"it would be a game changer in taking down transnational syndicates doing evil deeds worldwide and trying to shield those crimes by using cryptocurrency to move money.\"\nBinance\u0027s chief compliance officer, Noah Perlman, tells WIRED that Binance has collected \"know-your-customer\" information on users and cooperated with US law enforcement on data requests for the past two years. He added that all reports to the monitor firm inside Binance would be \"confidential\"—as in, not shared publicly, only with the US government—and that it would continue to abide by data privacy laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.\nBut Perlman also says he\u0027s \"excited\" for the new era the agreements represent for Binance. \"I feel like this is a great opportunity for Binance to set the standard for what compliance in this industry should look like,\" he says. \"For the general community, removing concerns of illicit finance in crypto is one of the most important things we can do to drive mainstream adoption. Hopefully, the vast majority of users will feel that there\u0027s assurance here, that the funds are safer than ever, and they have nothing to worry about as long as they\u0027re not part of the very small, small group of users that use crypto for illicit purposes.\"\nWhile Binance\u0027s new radical transparency may be welcomed by law enforcement and regulators, its users and advocates of financial privacy may not be so pleased. Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein calls the settlement an \"overreach\" that he believes is part of a US regulatory effort to set a precedent for crypto as a whole. “They’re going to try to force people to use these regulated platforms where everything is monitorable,\" Gladstein says. He adds that Binance is \"an unsavory corporation, but still, it\u0027s alarming what the US government is doing.\"\nDigital civil liberties nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation, too, has historically called on cryptocurrency exchanges to stop giving up users\u0027 transaction data to law enforcement and regulators without notifying those users. Now, the Binance settlement would create perhaps the most extreme case yet of that crypto exchange data-sharing, giving the US government wholesale access to the records of a crypto hub that at some points processed billions of transactions a day.\n\"EFF is increasingly worried about law enforcement turning to intermediaries such as cryptocurrency exchanges and hosted wallet providers to obtain sensitive user data,\" the EFF\u0027s cryptocurrency-focused attorney, Marta Belcher, wrote in a 2020 blog post. \"The fact that the transactions are made through cryptocurrency rather than through traditional financial channels indicates that the transactions are more likely to be sensitive, and that the person making the transaction may be turning to cryptocurrency precisely because of the privacy protection it provides.\" That argument may apply particularly to Binance, given its early reputation as an offshore exchange that didn\u0027t bow to US government data demands.\nIn fact, some Binance users may not have considered the risk of their data becoming available to crypto investigators in the new settlement, in part because Binance has at some points collected far less data on its users than other exchanges. Part of Binance\u0027s appeal to users has been that, for years, it asked only for a user\u0027s email address to set up an account—one of its many now-admitted violations of US know-your-customer requirements that led to last month\u0027s crackdown.But US law enforcement has proven that even troves of exchange data that lack users\u0027 names can nonetheless be highly revealing of their financial history—especially in combination with blockchain data and information from other exchanges that usually do comply with know-your-customer laws. In the case of the Welcome to Video child sexual abuse materials dark-web site in 2017, for instance, one alleged abuser was identified and arrested after his email address was tied to an account on the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e, which authorities had seized months earlier.\nIn another case, BTC-e\u0027s data allowed IRS criminal investigators to identify a hacker who had taken nearly 70,000 bitcoins from the Silk Road dark-web drug market—worth more than $3 billion today—and then track them down and seize the funds. Though BTC-e didn\u0027t collect users\u0027 names or other identifying details, its data still served as the missing link in both those cases—just as Binance\u0027s no doubt will in many more investigations to come.\nAssenting to have US regulators comb through its data, for a company that spent years resisting regulation, may be a severe culture shock, says Stark, the former SEC attorney. He says he won\u0027t be surprised if the company ends up violating the terms of the agreement. \"It\u0027s like taking someone who\u0027s been a drug addict for a decade and drug-testing them every day and thinking that they\u0027re not going to try to sneak something in,\" he says.\nUltimately, with enormous fines and criminal sentences hanging over the heads of its executives—and worse punishments if its settlement falls through—Binance may not have a choice about baring its soul to the US government. Neither, whether they know it or not, will its users.","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","PRIVACY","CRIME","POLICE","REGULATION"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2023-12-06"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/security-lapses-at-hacked-crypto-exchange-bitfinex/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"A security review describes how attackers exploited mistakes to steal millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.","title":"Report Suggests Security Lapses at Hacked Crypto Exchange Bitfinex","detailed_content":"WHEN A HACKER, or hackers, broke into the Bitfinex crypto exchange and stole 119,754 bitcoins in 2016, their haul was worth $72 million.

But, as in past crises, figuring out the right way to get aid to people has been a huge challenge. For people who have been displaced, the best support is cash. Unlike in-kind assistance like food or clothing, cash can be used for anything, and it’s flexible for when circumstances change. “We always ask ourselves: Why not cash?” says Carmen Hett, treasurer for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency.\nIn Defense of the Future\nThis story is part of WIRED30, our special 30th anniversary series. Read more here.\nThe humanitarian sector has historically been reluctant to distribute cash to refugees over fears—since debunked by multiple studies—that the money would be squandered on so-called temptation goods, like alcohol or tobacco. But cash has played a bigger role than ever in the Ukraine crisis. Nearly half of all of the aid delivered by the Disasters Emergency Committee, a coalition of UK-based charities, in the first six months of the war was in cash.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nHowever, cash is difficult to move around. It either has to be shipped physically by the pallet-load into war zones and disaster areas, creating logistical and security headaches, or delivered electronically via the traditional banking system, the rigidity of which can pose problems for people whose documentation has been lost.\nRecognizing these limitations, the UNHCR has moved to deploy an alternative system, partnering with the Stellar Development Foundation, a nonprofit that supports the growth of the Stellar blockchain network. The two organizations are working alongside money transfer company MoneyGram and Circle Internet Financial, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, to rig up a system for sending aid directly to Ukrainian refugees using crypto. Cryptocurrencies have often been dismissed as being useful only for financial speculation, but in Ukraine the technology may be a solution to a real-world problem.\n“This project is a prototype but a very real one,” says Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at Circle. “If you can solve the gaps in money logistics in such an acute conflict, it stands to reason that these types of innovations would be meaningful” in other contexts too.The system works like this: The UNHCR delivers USDC, a crypto coin locked to a $1 valuation and hosted on the Stellar network, to a digital wallet that can be accessed via smartphone. The recipient then exchanges their coins for local currency at any MoneyGram facility.\nThe UNHCR is also using standard bank transfers to distribute aid. However, as Hett says, although the Ukrainian banking system has so far proven resilient, if a bank were to fail, its customers would be left without access to the aid in their accounts. But a stablecoin is hosted on decentralized infrastructure and in the custody of individual wallet owners, which means funds cannot be withheld. Digital wallets are also available to people who don’t have a bank account.\nThe Ukrainian government has put in place strict capital controls to prevent money from flowing out of the local economy, meaning that refugees who have left the country face restricted access to funds in their bank accounts. But stablecoins are geography-agnostic; the only restriction in this context is the proximity of a MoneyGram location, of which there are 4,500 in Ukraine and roughly 350,000 worldwide.\nCrypto has been tapped to collect donations during humanitarian crises in the past. It has been successful in bringing together pools of money, but it can be difficult to actually use on the ground. In Turkey and Syria, after a huge earthquake in February that killed more than 50,000 people, recipients of crypto donations complained that they couldn’t spend the coins or turn them into fiat currency, limiting their usefulness. \n“The challenge is that there’s not a lot someone can do with crypto once they have it in their possession,” says Alex Holmes, MoneyGram’s CEO. “It’s not a form of payment that a lot of [vendors] accept.” \nThe UNHCR pilot overcomes this problem by building in a mechanism to convert crypto into cash. \nFor now, the stablecoin program in Ukraine is being piloted on a microscopic scale, with fewer than 100 participants in the cities of Kyiv, Lviv, and Vinnytsia. The UNHCR is preparing to expand the initiative to up to 5,000 wallets by April, but this would still represent only a fraction of the number of Ukrainians displaced by the war.\nHett declined to reveal how much cash has already been distributed via the program—information she describes as “not so important”—but insists the system is ready to scale. “It’s not about how many millions have flowed through,” she claims, “it’s about how many millions will flow through going forward.”\nUkraine may be an ideal proving ground for experimental financial services of this kind. Even before the war, the country was nurturing plans under President Volodymir Zelensky to become a digital-first economy and build a central bank digital currency—a blockchain-based version of Ukraine’s hryvnia.\n“You’ve got a community that is used to change, with high consumer technology penetration, and generations of people scattered across the globe,” says Dora Chomiak, board member at the Ukraine-focused nonprofit Razom. “Combine all of those things, and going beyond formal banking makes sense.”The process of launching the project has, in its own way, been radical for a humanitarian system known for its often ponderous bureaucracy.\nThe project was incubated for 10 months before being launched in December, far quicker than its backers anticipated, according to Denelle Dixon, CEO at the Stellar Development Foundation. As well as the usual red tape, the job of convincing stakeholders of the technology was made harder by the implosion of crypto exchange FTX in November, which sparked a crisis of confidence in the sector. “But I think that’s mostly behind us now,” says Dixon.\nThe goal is not to replace traditional cash-based intervention, say the UNHCR and its partners, but to arm humanitarian organizations with alternative rails for distributing aid that support the full range of scenarios refugees may find themselves in. “The real breakthroughs here are more evolutionary than revolutionary,” says Disparte. “It’s about extending the brick-and-mortar banking system beyond its many limitations.”\nIt is also important to avoid scenarios in which crypto is applied to problems that do not exist, says Dixon. “You never want crypto to be a square peg in a round hole. This is just another option—another tool in the toolbox.”\nIrrespective of the small scope of the initial pilot, the partners on the UNHCR scheme believe that projects like their own, as well as the $78 million in crypto donated to Ukrainian causes since the war began, hint at a permanent change in the way humanitarian aid will be distributed.\nThe UNHCR is investigating the potential for the same system to assist those displaced by the economic crises in Venezuela and Argentina, says Hett. And Holmes points to potential applications in Turkey and Syria.\n“Having portable access to money, no matter where they are, gives people the options to move on in life,” says Hett. “The question is now, how can we do more of this? Because we know it works.”","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","UKRAINE","RUSSIA","WIRED30"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2023-03-15"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/hottest-startups-amsterdam-2023/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The responsible AI, sustainable tech, and cleantech scenes are all thriving in Amsterdam, a city favored for its location, cost of living, and culture.","title":"The Hottest Startups in Amsterdam","detailed_content":"IT’S EASY TO see why global investment platform fDi Intelligence ranked Amsterdam a heavyweight for direct investment, maintaining its number two spot among major European cities.

His crypto-mining company, among the largest in the world, has found itself—like the rest of the industry—in the path of a perfect storm.\nOver the past year, the sector has been battered by a slump in the price of bitcoin, combined with a spike in the cost of energy and an increase in mining difficulty—a reflection of the amount of computing power directed at the bitcoin network, which dictates the proportion of coins miners are able to win. \nAt the height of the 2021 boom, profit margins in the mining business rose as high as 90 percent, says Thiel. But now, they have “totally collapsed.” If the price of bitcoin does not rally, he says, there will be “a lot more pain,” and firms that are only marginally profitable today will find themselves “very underwater.” \nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nAs they scramble to cut costs, miners are playing a high-stakes game of chicken. In spring 2024, the halving, a mechanism baked into the bitcoin system that periodically cuts the number of coins awarded in half, will slash mining profits. The goal for miners is to ensure they are in a strong enough financial position to survive the fall in profits longer than anyone else; as miners give in and drop from the network, the share of coins won by the rest will increase. \n“Any miners that are struggling now will not be able to survive the halving,” says Jeff Burkey, VP of business development at Foundry, which operates its own mining facilities, a large-scale mining pool, and a marketplace for mining hardware. The dynamic will create a rush among miners to get their houses in order, he explains.\nMiners will look to eke out additional profit margin wherever they can, whether by deploying superior hardware and cooling techniques, developing software to closely monitor the performance of machines, relocating to territories with cheaper power, or renegotiating the terms of their loans.\nOthers, like Geosyn Mining, are aiming at vertical integration—all the way down to the energy powering the facilities. The company, says CEO Caleb Ward, wants to construct its own solar farm to power its machines, thereby eliminating a major cost. “We need to be more thoughtful as an industry about how we protect against risk,” he says. “It’s not all about shooting for the moon.”\nMeanwhile, the miners whose financial predicaments prevent them from fine-tuning their operations are playing a dangerous waiting game, gambling on an increase in the price of bitcoin that may never come.\n“The beauty of halving cycles is that the industry [is forced] to become more efficient—a lot of weaker players will have to exit the business,” says Jeff Lucas, CFO of mining company Bitfarms, which has worked to restructure its finances in the downturn. “The devil is in the details.”\nAlready on the back foot, mining companies are beginning to fold. Compute North, which owned multiple large-scale mining facilities, filed for bankruptcy in September, and Core Scientific, a publicly traded miner, did the same in December. Others are having to maneuver. Argo Blockchain, also a public company, was forced to sell off mining equipment and its state-of-the-art mining center, while Stronghold Digital Mining has negotiated a debt repayment holiday. Neither company responded to interview requests.A combination of “immaturity, poor planning, and greed” has led miners to the brink of collapse, says Phil Harvey, CEO of Sabre56, a crypto-mining consultancy firm that also operates its own facilities. While the market was hot, companies took on large amounts of debt at high interest rates (10-20 percent) to finance expansion, says Harvey, and now the value of the coins they earn is insufficient to cover the costs of repayments.\nHistorically, a steep rise in the price of bitcoin, triggered by a buying frenzy, has been followed by a sharp fall and then a gradual recovery. Although there is no guarantee this pattern will repeat, the process is widely described as the bitcoin cycle. The fatal mistake, says Jaime Leverton, CEO of mining company Hut 8, was to imagine that that 2021 was different—that the industry was in a “supercycle” that was going to “break prior cycles” and extend the hot streak. A lot of people bought into this idea, she explains, and so were caught off-guard when the market tanked.\nIn an effort to strengthen its own position, Hut 8 is in the process of merging with US Bitcoin, another mining firm. The goal, says Leverton, is to minimize risks associated with the volatility of bitcoin by diversifying both revenue streams and the regions in which the business operates.\nWhereas Hut 8 only has facilities in Canada and mines exclusively for itself, US Bitcoin runs mines across the US and hosts mining hardware for third-party customers alongside other auxiliary services. “It’s important to be dynamic,” says Mike Ho, cofounder of US Bitcoin. “There is an optimal strategy, depending on the price of bitcoin. It’s about knowing how to navigate through the cycle at different stages.”\nRecognizing the trajectory of the market, other companies have sought to eliminate outstanding debt as rapidly as possible. In the summer of 2021, Bitfarms had $165 million of debt on its books, at interest rates between 16 and 18 percent. Lucas says it may seem “absurd” to stomach these exorbitant rates, but it “made sense” because the cost of debt was eclipsed by the revenue generated by mining activity—at least until it wasn’t. \n“As revenues came down dramatically with the price of bitcoin, there was still a high debt to pay for,” he says. “And that put a squeeze on a lot of companies.” \nIn June 2022, Bitfarms began to sell down the bitcoin in its treasury to eliminate its debt. Earlier this month, the firm also managed to negotiate down a $21 million debt to bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi that was instead paid off in a single $7.75 million cash payment. The company’s approach to slashing debt, coupled with a focus on maximizing the efficiency of its mining rigs, says Lucas, will put Bitfarms in good stead to weather the remainder of the crypto winter.\nThe scramble among miners to balance the books has attracted the attention of other market participants hoping to increase their market share at a reduced price. Investment firm Galaxy Digital has long been eager to expand its bitcoin-mining operations. Sensing an opportunity, the company swooped in to grab Argo’s flagship Helios mine in December, spending $65 million for a facility reported to have cost at least $1.5 billion to build.\nMergers, acquisitions, and collapses will continue to be a theme, says Alex Mologoko, analyst at blockchain intelligence company Elementus, until “all economically unsustainable mining operations are weeded out.”","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","MARKETS","BLOCKCHAIN"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2023-02-17"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/confusion-spirals-in-crypto-as-the-us-cracks-down/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The Securities and Exchange Commission launched enforcement actions against some of the industry’s major players, raising questions over crypto’s future.","title":"Confusion Spirals in Crypto as the US Cracks Down","detailed_content":"THE US SECURITIES and Exchange Commission is on the warpath—and crypto is in its crosshairs. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that the agency intends to sue crypto firm Paxos for issuing BUSD, a stablecoin developed in partnership with the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. \nThe SEC declined to comment, but Paxos, which is based in New York and Singapore, confirmed today that the agency alleges BUSD should have been registered as a security in the US, which requires compliance with complex rules. In a statement, the firm said it “categorically disagrees” that BUSD is a security but has complied with an order from the New York Department of Financial Services to halt the creation of any new BUSD, effectively strangling the coin.\nPaxos did not respond to a request for comment. Binance’s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann, declined to comment on how the SEC’s action would affect the exchange but said the firm will be “reviewing other projects to ensure users are insulated from further undue harm.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nThe crypto industry is no stranger to conflict with regulators, but the Paxos case is different—and it has sparked a measure of panic and confusion. The concern is that a ruling against the issuing or use of BUSD will set a precedent that could be applied to all stablecoins, striking down a crucial piece of infrastructure in many crypto markets. “If the supply suddenly dried up, the crypto economy would collapse,” says economist Frances Coppola, who previously worked for HSBC and other banks.\nDesigned to cling to a specific value, usually $1, stablecoins are a critical pillar of the crypto economy. Most are backed by a combination of cash and bonds, which anchors the tokens in circulation to the desired value.\nUnlike cash, which can be difficult to move around, especially across borders, stablecoins are “easy and fast,” says crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of CoinDesk, helping traders jump on opportunities as they arise. They have “opened up an economy on-chain,” says Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of wealth management firm Lumida, allowing money to “flow into and stay in the ecosystem.”\nThe SEC defines securities as contracts that amount to “an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit, to be derived from the efforts of others.” The classification brings with it a range of regulatory and disclosure requirements. If stablecoins were universally determined to be securities, issuers would be required to register them with the SEC, giving the agency a chance to reject coins. Any stablecoins already on the market could be subject to enforcement action.\nBemused members of the crypto industry, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, are now asking how stablecoins can possibly meet the SEC’s criteria, and in particular how crypto coins designed not to fluctuate in value can be said to be sold with a reasonable expectation of profit.\nBut action against a major stablecoin issuer should be no surprise, says Acheson, because the SEC has said on multiple occasions that it believes some stablecoins qualify as securities. Acheson imagines the regulator will argue that stablecoins like BUSD, backed by their issuer’s holdings of established securities such as government and corporate bonds, are by extension securities themselves and must be regulated accordingly.Because neither the SEC nor Paxos have specified the nature of the regulator’s complaint, says Ahluwalia, the impact of a potential lawsuit is unclear for now. But it can hardly be good for stablecoin issuers—and could signal more trouble to come.\nThe move against Paxos is the latest in a volley of enforcement actions launched by the SEC in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November. Last week, the regulator announced that crypto exchange Kraken would halt one of its services in the US, after the SEC charged the firm with failing to register a security. And in January, the agency charged crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital over different services offered to US customers. \nThis crackdown is being described in crypto circles as Operation Choke Point 2.0—a reference to a program launched by the Obama administration, under which US officials were alleged to have pressured banks into severing ties with disfavored industries like pornography and payday lending. \nCoppola says it feels like the SEC’s intention is to “drive crypto entirely offshore,” and out of the US altogether. “The SEC wants to prevent US citizens from interacting with crypto. And I think other countries may follow suit.”\nDespite fears the SEC will target stablecoins more broadly, Acheson, Coppola, and Ahluwalia all suspect the agency is taking on Paxos as a way to gain a measure of control over Binance, and that it does not reflect an enmity towards stablecoins in general. Although Binance is by far the world’s largest crypto exchange, it operates only a limited service in the US. But Reuters reports that the US has long believed Binance to have facilitated money laundering activity.\nBy taking aim at BUSD, the stablecoin that underpins much of Binance’s activity, says Coppola, the SEC can effectively shut the firm off from a source of US dollars. Ahluwalia agrees, suggesting the SEC is looking for creative ways to “defang” Binance. “If you’re a regulator that has suspicions but not jurisdiction, you pull the levers at your disposal,” he says. Binance has always maintained that it plays a central role in helping law enforcement deal with financial crime.\nUntil the SEC makes its intentions known, though, the crypto industry must wait. “We’re all just guessing,” says Ahluwalia. If the SEC were to go after other stablecoin issuers, like Circle or Tether, the consequences would be severe. Without stablecoins acting as a “bridge” between volatile coins, trading would become more expensive and riskier, says Coppola—and the decentralized finance sector as a whole could topple. “Potentially,” she says, “this could bring down the entire crypto edifice.”","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","REGULATION","FINANCE"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2023-02-13"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-mining-texas-energy-grid/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The energy demands of bitcoin mining have sparked controversy in a state that once welcomed those companies with open arms.","title":"For Bitcoin Mines in Texas, the Honeymoon Is Over","detailed_content":"Three years ago, bitcoin miners flocked to the state of Texas.

Governments could agree to buy generative AI only from companies that mark their output in this way, creating considerable market incentives.

There are three broad approaches to watermarking digital content. The first is to add metadata, which cameras have been doing for decades. Blocks of text are often marked up as well. When you type something in bold, or set a font’s color on a website, the word processor or browser labels your content with metadata. But it’s application-specific: Paste some bold text into your address bar, and the formatting is gone.\nYou can also watermark digital images using steganography, which hides one message inside another cryptographically. First used by spies to smuggle secrets, there are now plenty of design tools that add hidden markings to images, then crawl the web looking for copyright violators. And encryption works for watermarking too. You can digitally sign a paragraph of text, and then tell when it’s been altered, either through a centralized system (a digital certificate authority) or a distributed one (a blockchain). This is why that movie you bought only plays in iTunes, and that NFT you’ve forgotten about still belongs to you.\nBut these approaches have three fundamental problems. First, they require immense coordination. By contrast, a good AI markup solution would need to work seamlessly across billions of devices. The markings would have to survive being copied and pasted from one app, operating system, or platform to another. Second, any solution would have to be accessible to any human with an internet connection, without any training, immediately. It would need to be deployable to the whole world with just a software update.\nThird, while watermarks work well enough for large objects like images, songs, or book chapters, they don’t work for smaller objects like individual words or letters. That means these approaches don’t handle content that blends human and machine well. If you have a document that’s generated by an AI, and then edited by a human, you need a more fine-grained watermark—the digital equivalent of a highlighter.\nThat may seem like an impossibly tall order. But in fact, this system already exists: Unicode.\nUnicode is the universal numbering system for text, and text is the fundamental building block of the internet. In Unicode, every character has a number. The Latin Capital Letter A, for example, is hexadecimal number 41. But there are plenty of other A’s in Unicode: There’s Fullwidth Latin Capital Letter A (Ａ, number EF BC A1), Mathematical Bold Capital A (𝐀, number F0 9D 90 80), Mathematical Sans-Serif Capital A (𝖠, F0 9D 96 A0), and plenty of others. Each A has its own name, its own Unicode value, and in some cases, its own font shape. Why not create a letter A just for AI?Unlike metadata, which is attached to content, the unicode value is the content. If the companies who pledged to watermark AI content at the point of origin do so using Unicode—essentially giving AI its own character set—we’ll have a ready-made, fine-grained AI watermark that works across all devices, platforms, operating systems, and websites.\nIt’s important to note that this proposed markup is not an enforcement mechanism. Bad actors could easily convert AI text to look like it was written by a human. A recipient still needs to trust a sender in order to believe what is marked up. But that’s one of the strengths of this approach. Once text is marked, a human has to actively remove the AI marker at some stage between the LLM and the consumer. We have legal mechanisms to investigate and deal with negligence or wrongdoing. The proposed protocol simply lets us apply these to AI.\nThis hack has its limitations, of course. There’s a finite amount of room in Unicode, and many languages to support. Also, some text-to-speech tools may not read Unicode variants aloud, making this article confusing for those who are listening to it. These things need to be addressed. But Unicode offers a ready-made approach that’s already widely adopted. We designed it so that all humans could use the internet; we can also use it to coexist with AI.\nWhat’s more, the companies who steer the future of Unicode—the Unicode Consortium—are many of the same tech giants at the core of generative AI, and three of them just promised to watermark AI content.\nWe have labels for the things we put in our bodies. We should care as much about what we put in our minds. This proposal represents a reasonable, practical, nonpartisan first step down that path—one that can change the way billions of humans consume information with just a software update.\nWIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of viewpoints.

Moving away from fossil fuels remains necessary, but Siddarth Kara captures a painful truth in Cobalt Red: The electric revolution has an underbelly, too. Rechargeable batteries, including those within phones and electric vehicles, are usually manufactured with cobalt, a metal plentiful in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Cobalt Red is a grim investigation into the conditions workers experience within “artisanal” cobalt mines; child labor is rampant, and death on the job is commonplace. It’s a call to arms to push companies using these batteries to clean up their supply chains, and for those of us who buy consumer devices to interrogate how they’re made and how we treat those who make them.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nDo You Remember Being Born?\nby Sean Michaels\nCOURTESY OF ASTRA HOUSE\nJust as there was a rush of lockdown-themed novels following the first wave of Covid-19, it’s a near-certainty that readers are about to get hit with a deluge of fiction about large language models. It’s too bad, because Canadian novelist and music critic Sean Michaels has already written the definitive novel about art in the age of AI, one that incorporates machine-generated phrases and sentences in an unexpectedly moving way.\nDo You Remember Being Born? follows a 75-year-old poet after she accepts an invitation to spend a week cowriting a poem with an AI trained on her work. A novel about the value of writing must clear a very high stylistic bar to succeed, and Michaels produces some of the most beautiful sentences published this year.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nNatural Beauty\nby Ling Ling Huang\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nAfter her mother and father are severely injured in a car accident, a piano prodigy finds work at a wellness startup called Holistik, where affluent customers indulge in gloriously weird beautifying treatments like pubic hair transplants. Natural Beauty is a delightfully baroque grotesque about wellness culture—Goopcore, if you will.\nLing Ling Huang’s debut novel can achieve a folkloric power in its creepiest moments; it’s a scary story you’d tell in a posh spa’s sauna instead of around a campfire. Recommended for anyone with mixed emotions about the rise of cosmetic Ozempic use.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nFire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World\nby John Vaillant\nCOURTESY OF ALFRED A. KNOPF\nThe day John Vaillant’s book about Canadian wildfires came out in the US last summer, Canadian wildfires became a temporary American obsession. Skies in the northeastern United States turned orange, hazy, and hazardous as the result of more than 400 infernos in Canada’s vast boreal forests in early June. New York City’s air quality became the worst in the world, choked with smoke blown down from Quebec. Philadelphia urged residents to stay indoors. Fire weather, indeed. Great publicity, but so bleak—like releasing a history of terrorist attacks in September 2001.\nUpon its release, I recommended Vaillant’s gripping account of the 2016 Fort McMurray fire as the best thing to read to understand this particular crisis, and that recommendation stands. It’s vital context for how our forests got so flammable.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nNumber Go Up: Inside Crypto’s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall\nby Zeke Faux\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nThe month after Bloomberg reporter Zeke Faux’s Number Go Up came out, disgraced crypto bigwig Sam Bankman-Fried went on trial. It was good timing for Faux, as he’d opened his rollicking crypto-world travelogue with an account of meeting SBF. In fact, the opening line is a quote from Bankman-Fried: “I’m not going to lie,” SBF promises Faux. “This was a lie,” Faux writes. This accomplishes two things. First, it signals immediately to the reader that Faux gets it, that he knows Bankman-Fried was full of it. Second, it’s funny.\nNumber Go Up is definitely the best book to read for anyone who wants to understand what happened with SBF and FTX; I’d argue it’s also the best book to give any general-interest reader who wants to learn more about why crypto has crashed and burned.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nTokens: The Future of Money in the Age of the Platform\nby Rachel O’Dwyer\nCOURTESY OF VERSO\nIrish writer Rachel O’Dwyer’s Tokens also came out shortly before the SBF trial, and it’s also an excellent book to pick up for anyone interested in crypto. It didn’t get as much attention as Number Go Up, in part because it has a more diffuse focus—O’Dwyer considers crypto as part of a larger movement into tokenized payment, including Twitch bits (the virtual goods used to reward Twitch streamers) and Axie Infinity’s doomed “Axie” NFTs.

(And a gentle satire of internet culture: Downloaded porn, fitness wearables, and Facebook radicalization all figure prominently into the plot.)\nWellness is also an old-fashioned, occasionally overstuffed throwback of a book. Over 600 pages long, it centers on the love story of Jack and Elizabeth, two artsy students in 1990s Chicago who settle down together and find themselves straining toward happiness in middle age.

Leftist journalist? Climate activist? Decidedly not the former liberal feminist writer turned conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf? Somehow, people confuse the two Naomis. Klein gets mixed up with Wolf so much, in fact, a Twitter mnemonic was born: “If the Naomi be Klein you’re doing just fine / If the Naomi be Wolf, oh, buddy. Ooooof.”\nThus the basis of Klein’s new book, Doppelganger. Writing hundreds of pages based on Twitter discourse is, of course, a questionable choice. As she is quick to point out, though, Doppelganger is not really about Wolf. She’s merely an entry point to dissect the “intellectual and ideological mayhem” of the Covid era. How wellness entrepreneurs demonize medicine. How the far right appropriates and warps leftist talking points. How parents see their children as reflections of themselves. In all this, Klein writes, there’s a new doubling going on—distortions of what used to be more straightforward realities. It’s a wholly vital work, one only Klein could write.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nAnansi’s Gold: The Man Who Looted the West, Outfoxed Washington, and Swindled the World\nby Yepoka Yeebo\nCOURTESY OF BLOOMSBURY\nTry as we might to move past it, we’re still living through the golden age of grifters, so Anansi’s Gold is another timely read for 2023. Reporter Yepoka Yeebo unravels the riveting tale of big-time conman John Ackah Blay-Miezah, an audacious, globe-trotting Ghanaian who convinced investors from Philadelphia to Accra that he could access a gold fortune allegedly lost by Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah.\nYeebo pulls off something near-magical here. She excavates an overlooked historical narrative as juicy as any true-crime blockbuster, where every detail is both fastidiously researched and completely over-the-top—one of Blay-Miezah’s major adversaries in his quest to scam? Former child star Shirley Temple Black, of course!—while also conveying how the colonial system nurtured and turbo-charged this dysfunction.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nYour Face Belongs to Us: A Secretive Startup’s Quest to End Privacy as We Know It\nby Kashmir Hill\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nI dare you to read this alternately amusing and horrifying account of the rise of an oddball startup selling the world’s most powerful facial recognition tools without, at least one time, putting it down to google how to move to a remote location without Wi-Fi.\nShortly after starting a new job at The New York Times, longtime privacy reporter Kashmir Hill got a tip about Clearview AI, a tiny company that had quietly scraped photos from the internet to become a Shazam for people. In addition to providing the fullest account of how this company’s tech is used to undermine our privacy, Your Face Belongs to Us is also a finely-drawn portrait of the type of people who would sell this type of product, especially founder Hoan Ton-That, an intelligent misfit who seems driven more by personal insecurities than any genuine ideological commitments.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nOur Hideous Progeny\nby C. E. McGill\nCOURTESY OF HARPERCOLLINS\nI was not expecting to love this book so much. It seemed like it could be a Pride and Prejudice and Zombies-ish cash grab, trading on the enduring popularity of Frankenstein. (It is billed as an update and sequel of sorts to Mary Shelley’s classic.) It’s not. Our Hideous Progeny might start as a Frankenstein spinoff, following Victor Frankenstein’s grand-niece in 1850s London, but then it pivots into something that could reasonably be described as “bizarro queer feminist prequel to Jurassic Park.”\nThis is cozy horror perfected, the literary equivalent of spending a weekend storm-watching in a leaky castle in northern Scotland.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nThe Book of Ayn\nby Lexi Freiman\nCOURTESY OF CATAPULT\n“Cancel culture satire” might be the most cursed phrase in the English language, but somehow Lexi Freiman wrote a cancel culture satire and it’s funny and tough and generous without ever being sentimental.\nThe Book of Ayn follows Anna, a horny contrarian novelist who gets ostracized by her lit-world pals after writing a poorly-received comic novel about the opioid crisis and subsequently becomes obsessed with Ayn Rand, then moves to a commune to destroy her ego. A meaner writer might’ve let Anna sour into a full-blown villain, but Freiman turns her into something more interesting: a narcissistic millennial writer character who defies cliche and always feels human.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nThe Palestine Laboratory: How Israel Exports the Technology of Occupation Around the World\nby Antony Loewenstein\nCOURTESY OF VERSO BOOKS\nWhat does the Jeff-Bezos-phone-hacking incident have to do with the plight of the Palestinians?

I am Michael Calore. I\u0027m a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I\u0027m Lauren Goode. I\u0027m a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We are joined this week once again by WIRED senior writer Andy Greenberg. Andy, welcome back to the show.\nAndy Greenberg: Thanks to you both for having me on again.\nMichael Calore: It\u0027s great to have you back. We\u0027re talking about cryptocurrency again on today\u0027s show, but it\u0027s not really in the way that you might expect. Andy, at the end of last year, you published a book. It\u0027s called Tracers in the Dark. It\u0027s filled with stories about investigators who have been able to track down criminals by studying their cryptocurrency transactions. These are people who operated on the dark web, places like Silk Road, AlphaBay, and Welcome to Video, a site where users shared child sex abuse videos. These criminal enterprises were funded and fueled by cryptocurrency, primarily bitcoin. Now, since bitcoin has existed, people have been using it to buy and sell all sorts of legal and illegal things online. They may not see that behavior as risky if they\u0027re doing something illegal, because they\u0027re operating under the assumption that bitcoin transactions are untraceable. Now, that\u0027s never really been true, but that belief has persisted anyway. Andy, this myth of anonymity around cryptocurrency is a running theme in your book. How did this myth come to be?\nAndy Greenberg: Well, I have to admit that I am in some sense a part of it, Mike. I wrote the first print magazine piece about bitcoin in 2011—thankfully, in some sense, not for WIRED magazine. I worked at Forbes magazine at the time. I covered this world of anonymity and hackers and surveillance, and I came upon this new phenomenon. Bitcoin was described to me as a kind of untraceable, anonymous digital cash for the internet. I was talking with some of the first bitcoin developers, and even Satoshi Nakamoto, this mysterious creator of bitcoin, had written in this email to a cryptography mailing list that, among other things, participants can be anonymous in this new cryptocurrency world that he or she or whoever they are was describing. So I wrote this first piece in 2011, and I did describe in this Forbes piece how this seemed to be a kind of untraceable digital cash. You could put unmarked bills in a briefcase and send them across the internet to anybody without revealing your identity if you were careful, it seems. Of course, I immediately also was imagining, just being the kind of reporter I am, that this was going to unlock a whole world of money laundering and online drug deals and, I don\u0027t know, terrorist financing. All of that, in some sense, did come to pass over the following years because it did seem … And it wasn\u0027t just me. Even Satoshi Nakamoto believed that bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally, as there became more flavors of cryptocurrency, had these anonymous properties. It was only, I would say, at least fast-forward a whole decade, around 2020, that I started to realize how completely wrong I was about this. How not just I was a little bit wrong, but actually 180 fully opposite of correct about this—that bitcoin is actually fully traceable. In fact, it is much easier to follow the money if you can crack and decipher the blockchain with cryptocurrency than even with traditional finance. It was actually when I started to see the Department of Justice credit this one company, Chainalysis, which is a cryptocurrency tracing firm, in one announcement after another, I started looking into this world of investigators who had figured this out much earlier than me. I saw that this small group of detectives had learned to trace cryptocurrency within law enforcements in many cases, and had used this to take down one massive cybercriminal operation after another over the last 10 years. That escalating spree of massive busts and takedowns is the story of this book, Tracers in the Dark.Lauren Goode: Describe in the most accessible way possible how that tracing actually works.\nAndy Greenberg: Well, I think an even better way to start thinking about it is, how in the world, Andy, could you have been so stupid to ever think that bitcoin was untraceable? Because—\nLauren Goode: This podcast is now an Andy Greenberg mea culpa.\nAndy Greenberg: Well, because the whole notion of bitcoin is that it is basically backed up and guaranteed by not a bank or a corporation or a government, but the blockchain, this list of every single transaction. So how in the world could you have ever thought that was private when, those transactions, the notion of the blockchain is that they\u0027re copied out to thousands of computers around the world and can\u0027t be changed or erased? But the blockchain only records transactions between bitcoin addresses. It doesn\u0027t have any identifying information, it seemed to early cryptocurrency users and to me in 2011 or so. But then around 2013, this researcher, Sarah Meiklejohn, at the University of California San Diego, was the first to really look into whether this is true, that the blockchain does provide any privacy, or if there was some way to find patterns in this massive collection of data. She started quickly to find clever tricks to cluster bitcoin addresses and to show that sometimes dozens or hundreds or even millions, in some cases, of addresses could provably be shown to belong to a single person or service or sometimes a dark web drug market like Silk Road, which had come online by that point. Then sometimes you could follow the money from one of those clusters and see bitcoins move from one address to the next and, with other kind of tricks, figure out which path to take when there was a fork in the road until the money hits a cryptocurrency exchange. Cryptocurrency exchanges are legally required by US law anyway to have “know your customer” requirements, and they actually do have identifying information on their users. So when people cashed out their bitcoins, traded them for dollars, or vice versa, when they bought their bitcoins with traditional money, you could often get their identifying information with a subpoena with this kind of small collection of tricks. Also, another thing she would do is, she would interact undercover with people in the cryptocurrency world. In doing so, she would sometimes put money into the Silk Road drug market, for instance, and see which address she had interacted with and then know that that address was part of a bigger cluster, and so identify that whole cluster. With this whole bag of tricks that she created, it started to become clear that actually you could start to identify services on the blockchain and follow the money—and in some cases, see real crimes recorded in an indelible, unerasable, unchangeable way in this permanent record. It was only after Sarah Meiklejohn and her coauthors at UCSD published that paper that Chainalysis launched. This Danish tech entrepreneur named Michael Gronager created Chainalysis and automated those tricks and built them into this piece of software that was then made available to law enforcement agencies—who quickly, or not quickly, but bit by bit saw the power of this investigative technique that became a kind of secret super weapon, like a devining rod to track down dark-web criminals and all these people who thought that they were invisible when in fact they were anything but.Michael Calore: That\u0027s something that I think is pretty clear when you\u0027re reading your book is that there\u0027s this cat-and-mouse cycle where criminals are taking greater and greater steps to obfuscate their true identity, and law enforcement is getting savvier and savvier at figuring out people\u0027s real identities who are doing illegal things on the dark web. But we should also note that, among all of that, there are still a lot of people, particularly on the consumer end, people buying things on the dark web, who are being really sloppy. What sorts of rookie mistakes were people making that led to them getting caught pretty easily?\nAndy Greenberg: Well, actually, when I was writing for Forbes back in 2013, at this point I was kind of obsessed with the Silk Road drug market, and I did some test transactions. I can now legally say I bought some marijuana for Forbes on it. The sidebar of a story I was writing on the Silk Road, where I was interviewing the Dread Pirate Roberts, the administrator of that dark-web drug market, and I was foolish enough to send, in some cases, bitcoins directly from my Coinbase wallet to the Silk Road. But then in other cases, I think I did send it through intermediary addresses in an attempt to cover my tracks. When I showed all this to Sarah Meiklejohn, she very easily could trace all of my transactions. She had done undercover transactions with the Silk Road. She had identified that cluster, so she could easily see exactly which drug deals I had done. I think that this kind of captures the problem, which is that cryptocurrency users are not that dumb about this. We all thought back then that if you were just a little bit clever, of course, some mistakes would reveal your cryptocurrency transactions in the blockchain, but if you were really clever, if you just stayed a step ahead of the tracers, if you took some obfuscating steps, then you could actually still be more private with cryptocurrency than with traditional money on the internet. But I think Sarah Meiklejohn and then Chainalysis, which is now this $8.6 billion company that has hired every brilliant person they can think of to find these patterns in the blockchain, what they have shown is that it\u0027s a better rule of thumb just to say it\u0027s impossible. You will not be able to win this cat-and-mouse game, at least with bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are like it. There are now cryptocurrencies that are designed to be far less traceable than bitcoin or ether or those kinds of well-known original cryptocurrencies. But the problem also with this cat-and-mouse game is that you can use state-of-the-art, cutting-edge obfuscation and anonymity techniques, but somebody years later can figure out a new trick to defeat those techniques. Because it\u0027s all recorded in the blockchain forever, they can basically go back in time and excavate that evidence and use it against you, sometimes to prove that you committed a crime. So it\u0027s like a cat-and-mouse game where the cats can travel back in time to solve the crimes, and the mice have to think years and years ahead into the future, which is basically impossible. So I think it\u0027s almost better just to think of most cryptocurrencies as just completely transparent, which is truly the opposite of what they were promised to be in many cases. I think it\u0027s also fair to describe it as having served as a kind of trap for people seeking financial privacy and lots of criminals who were seduced by this false idea and then found that law enforcement was able to just turn the lights on and carry out these huge busts where many hundreds of people were arrested.Michael Calore: Wow. Well, let\u0027s take a quick break and we\u0027ll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: The crypto market has been pretty wild lately. There\u0027s all the recent drama with Sam Bankman-Fried and the collapse of the FTX Exchange. There\u0027s the cratered market around NFTs, the rapid devaluation and erratic behavior of many of the currencies. Andy, have these recent instabilities in the cryptocurrency market at all slowed down the use of it on the dark web or in other illicit markets?\nAndy Greenberg: I don\u0027t think that they have, for the most part. The one big crime that has kind of slowed down because of the fall in the value of cryptocurrency is scamming, because scammers depend on people believing that their cryptocurrency is going to keep going up in value. But on the dark web, cryptocurrency is really just a means of transaction, and it doesn\u0027t really matter so much what it\u0027s worth. In fact, the fact that bitcoin appreciated massively from the time when I was buying marijuana on the Silk Road in 2013 really now just means that I spent tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins on a few grams of pot, which is unfortunate when you think about it. But the dark web is not the only place where these crimes that are now traced by the tracers who are the central detectives in my book are taking place. There are also just straight-up thefts that are a huge part of the dark side of the crypto world. When FTX collapsed, in the midst of that collapse, which was like a traditional finance story in a way—an over-leveraged bank or something, or a Lehman Brothers or maybe like a Theranos story. But there\u0027s also a straight-up crime story here, where about half a billion dollars of FTX\u0027s funds were actually just stolen in the midst of its bankruptcy, and we don\u0027t know by whom still. The bizarre thing about the blockchain is that all of these tracers can watch this theft happen in real time. We can see these hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency taken out of FTX and then moved around. They seem to be packaged to try to launder them. But because it\u0027s all so transparent and traceable, it\u0027s going to be very difficult for whoever took that money to cash it out or spend it or get away with this crime in a way where they won\u0027t be identified. So we\u0027ll probably soon know if the person who did that was some sort of inside embezzler or external hackers who were trying to take advantage of the chaos of FTX\u0027s meltdown.\nLauren Goode: Do you see a mainstream future for some of the more privacy-focused coins, like monero—am I saying that correctly, monero?—or will they be kept at arm\u0027s length by legitimate financial institutions?\nAndy Greenberg: It\u0027s really interesting to watch. I mean, monero is one that is being adopted. Monero, for the people who maybe haven\u0027t heard of it, it\u0027s not the most popular cryptocurrency by any means, but it is designed to be much less traceable than bitcoin and to tangle up its blockchain and obfuscate the amounts and make it hard to see who is sending money to whom. And monero is being adopted by dark web markets. One of the big stories in this book is the hunt for and the takedown of the kingpin of AlphaBay, which was this dark web market that became 10 times the size of the Silk Road. Now, years after AlphaBay was taken down, it actually reappeared in 2021, and now only accepts monero, which is a sign of the cat-and-mouse game, as Mike put it, that is occurring and the ways that people are starting to wise up to the traceability of bitcoin at least. But we see that cat-and-mouse game continuing because it does actually seem like sometimes monero, much to the surprise of all of these people using it, can sometimes be traced. monero people hate it when I point this out. In this big case that happened about a year ago where these two New Yorkers were arrested and accused of money laundering … You probably heard of this case because the woman in this couple had posted these terrible, super cringey rap videos on YouTube. $3.6 billion was seized from this couple, the biggest seizure of money of any kind in US criminal history. They had actually transferred some of that money into monero. Yet, you can see in court documents that the IRS criminal investigators, who were the central detectives in that case, continued to follow it and to identify them as the ones holding it. There\u0027s actually even leaked Chainalysis documents that appeared on the dark web that show that Chainalysis says to its law enforcement customers that it can trace monero in the majority of cases. So even when people, even now, believe that they\u0027re using a privacy coin, something that\u0027s less traceable, they\u0027re often still going to be surprised, I think, by how clever the tracers have become, how hard it is to use cryptocurrency anonymously. But I feel like I have to also mention that there is a newer cryptocurrency, zcash, that does seem to be truly untraceable, that uses these new, almost magical-seeming cryptography tricks called zero-knowledge proofs to basically fully encrypt its blockchain, so that there is no information for blockchain analysis or tracing of any kind. That may be finally the untraceable cryptocurrency that people believed bitcoin was. Yeah, as you say, Lauren, it\u0027s going to be really interesting to see if zcash is more adopted, and if it is, if it becomes this popular tool for crime or what people once called crypto-anarchy, carving out a space where you can\u0027t collect taxes, you can do any black market transaction you want, will that lead to some sort of regulatory backlash where regulators try to ban zcash or prevent exchanges from letting you buy and sell it?Lauren Goode: Well, I\u0027m definitely not an expert in regulation, but I do think a lot about permanence on the internet, what is permanent and what is not, and how we\u0027ve sometimes deluded ourselves into thinking that some of the things we do, the actions we take, like using cryptocurrency to make a purchase on the dark web or even just moving something into the trash on our desktops, that that somehow is untraceable, that something is vanishing when actually we are laying down these infinitesimal bits, these 1s and 0s that are now the mesh network of our lives. And it\u0027s really pretty permanent.\nAndy Greenberg: In some ways, cryptocurrency is a little parable about how people think about committing crimes on the internet, or just their privacy, that we are all leaving this digital exhaust trail. In some cases, you can see these in the stories of the book as well. In one case, the administrator of AlphaBay was first identified because he leaked his email address in a welcome email to the AlphaBay user forums. Although he fixed that problem within days, years later, an anonymous tipster gave that email address to the DEA, and that\u0027s how they first learned his name. They later proved his identity and dispelled any doubts and were able to charge him because they traced his cryptocurrency. Yeah, we leave these breadcrumbs behind that we\u0027re not aware of. I just think that it turns out the cryptocurrency is maybe the most ironic, the clearest, craziest example of that, because people really thought that they were invisible. In fact, they were leaving totally clear, indelible trails that show every transaction that you make for all time. There are cases where, for instance, IRS criminal investigations identified the alleged creator of a bitcoin money laundering service called Bitcoin Fog by tracing his transactions before he even successfully launched the site, 10 years earlier. So it is just a true, as Edward Snowden would say, a permanent record that, for good or ill, can be used to solve crimes, but also to expose human behavior in a way that we\u0027re really just not ready for.\nMichael Calore: Well, thanks Andy for coming on the show and talking about this. Let\u0027s take a break, and when we come back we\u0027ll do our recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore:  This is the last segment of our show where each of us recommends something our listeners might like. Andy, you get to go first.\nAndy Greenberg: Oh, wow. Well, I have to say I was going to recommend a book called You Are Not Expected to Understand This, which is a collection of essays about lines of code that my WIRED colleague, Lily Hay Newman, contributed to. But Lily, it turns out, already recommended this book on the show, she tells me, a couple weeks ago. So I have to come up with another one. Although, I have to say, that as a really delightful collection of little parables about the history of computing. I guess instead I will recommend this game that I have been obsessed with for years now called Getting Over It. It seems completely ridiculous, but I found it to be kind of profound. You basically are this naked man in a pot with a hammer, and you have to use this hammer to climb a mountain of junk, basically. It\u0027s very hard. You constantly can fall and basically lose all the progress that you have made. You can\u0027t die in any way. There\u0027s no lives. You just sometimes fall and lose the weeks and weeks of climbing that you have put into the game. It\u0027s like this little experiment in extreme frustration. The creator of the game, Bennett Foddy, talks to you actually throughout the game, telling you his theories about the nature of failure and frustration and playing bits of songs and poetry that are all around the theme of just the difficulties of life. I find it almost inspiring in a way. I have actually now played through it hundreds of times. I think I\u0027m in the top 5 percent of players in terms of how many times I\u0027ve played through it, worldwide. Now my 6-year-old son has gotten curious about it, and I just sit and watch him play it. I find that, for a 6-year-old, it\u0027s an interesting practice and how frustrated can he become and can he tolerate, which is an important thing for a kid to figure out. Yeah, Getting Over It, I recommended it to everyone.Michael Calore: Nice. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is another work of Andy\u0027s actually. We\u0027re just recommending each other\u0027s work on this podcast. We really do like each other this much here at WIRED.\nAndy Greenberg: It\u0027s so incestuous, but I appreciate it. Thank you.\nLauren Goode: I know I sometimes make fun of Mike for talking about being vegan, not being vegan itself, just that you talk about it. But Andy\u0027s latest story is going to make you want to avoid eating American-raised pork, because it has made me vow not to eat anymore pork. It\u0027s a story about how an animal rights activist group, which Andy has written about before, and WIRED revealed using spy cameras what really happens inside of carbon-dioxide stunning chambers, which are used to slaughter pigs. It\u0027s pretty horrific. Food companies have claimed that these CO2 chambers lead to what they would say is painless loss of consciousness and death for the animals. But these videos and Andy\u0027s story reveal that, for these pigs, the deaths are anything but painless. It\u0027s a pretty hard read, and the videos are even harder to watch. But if you can stomach it, I recommend reading that story. Mike, what\u0027s your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: My recomm—\nLauren Goode: Perhaps recommend some vegan food for us.\nMichael Calore: My recommendation is stop eating bacon.\nLauren Goode: There you go. You said it so much more simply than I did.\nMichael Calore: I\u0027m going to recommend a book. It\u0027s called Art Is Life. It\u0027s by Jerry Saltz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic of New York Magazine and just all around fantastic writer. It is a collection of the last 25 years or so of his essays and criticism and profiles and writing about the art world, particularly artists who are challenging some long-held beliefs in the art world, and artists who are trying new things and stretching the boundaries, and artists who he feels are overrated or overexposed and his thoughts about them. If you have any interest in contemporary art, then you know Jerry Saltz, and you know that you should read this book, so I\u0027m just giving you a nudge. You should definitely check it out. It\u0027s brand-new. I\u0027m consuming the audio book, so it is kind of fun to hear his voice read back to me the words that I\u0027ve read before, not knowing what his voice sounds like. Also, I own the book in physical form, and it\u0027s just as enjoyable in either medium. So that\u0027s my recommendation, Art Is Life, by Jerry Saltz.\nLauren Goode: The other day, you and I were having a Slack conversation about something completely unrelated. I was like, “Oh, something, something,” about the BART from Berkeley, and you just replied with a photo of Jerry Saltz, and you wrote, \"Jerry Saltz, exclamation point. I\u0027m currently reading/listening to his book.\"\nMichael Calore: Well, because he was on Kara\u0027s podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, that\u0027s great.\nMichael Calore: He was on Kara Swisher\u0027s podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, but you heard about Jerry Saltz here first.\nMichael Calore: Yes, yes, indeed. Well, that is our show. Andy, thanks again for joining us.\nAndy Greenberg: Thanks to you both. It\u0027s always fun.\nLauren Goode: Always fun having you on, Andy.\nMichael Calore: Once again, the book is called Tracers in the Dark. It\u0027s out now. You can buy it anywhere, and you could read some long excerpts of the book on WIRED.com, including the stories about the operations to take down AlphaBay and Welcome to Video. Just check the show notes. We\u0027ll link to those there. Thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter and Mastodon. Again, just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth. We will be back next week, provided all these new chatbot search engines don\u0027t take our jobs.

The space reverberates with the hum of 3D printers, the devices that gave 3D his nom de guerre. A network engineer, 3D comes across as controlled and cautious, but from time to time, mostly when he’s speaking about his printers, a playful grin appears on his face. He spoke on condition that WIRED would not reveal his real name or show his face. “My parents would kill me if they [knew] what I’m up to,” he says. Not only does 3D face the risk of arrest, torture, and execution for his part in the revolution, but the military would also not hesitate to arrest his parents if they were to discover 3D’s identity.\nMyanmar’s borderlands have been plagued by civil conflicts since the end of World War II. Rebel groups, often delineated along ethnic lines, have sought autonomy from a state that was stitched together by the British Empire, and which unified distinct ancient kingdoms. The civil war escalated dramatically after the military seized power in February 2021, reversing years of tentative democratic progress. Thousands of people took to the streets to protest, but the military cracked down with stunning brutality, killing hundreds of civilians across the country. Many people took up arms against the regime, or joined existing insurgencies. Today, over 250 rebel groups are fighting against the military dictatorship in all corners of the country, turning Myanmar into a patchwork of front lines, no-man’s-land, and islands controlled by a mosaic of insurgents.\n3D joined the peaceful protests in the eastern town of Loikaw in the aftermath of the coup and witnessed the bloody response. “They fired with live ammunition at the protesters and killed many,” he says. After he saw that, 3D decided to join the revolution. He enrolled in an armed insurgent group that consisted of civilian volunteers like himself, named the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF). What he found was a resistance movement that was massively outgunned. “We had nothing when our resistance began two years ago, and we took up against a military titan,” 3D says. “That’s when I thought, I have to find a way to make weapons from scratch.” Before the revolution began, 3D already owned a 3D printer. “But I just used it as a hobby. When I saw the urgent need for weapons, I decided to find a way to use my 3D printer.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Today, 3D’s printers are at the heart of the rebel group’s in-house weapons program, producing drones, stabilizers for mortars, and other munitions to support the pro-democracy fighters. These are tools that have become closely associated with Ukraine’s scrambled, open sourced defense against Russia’s invasion, but, as 3D’s work on Myanmar’s front lines shows, the bootstrapping of warfare has become a global phenomenon.\n“Without 3D printing, someone can manufacture a very high-quality weapon,” Yannick Veilleux-Lepage, assistant professor of political science at the Royal Military College of Canada, says. “But that does require a great deal of skill. You need to be a competent metal worker, and that takes a long time. With a 3D-printed firearm, it doesn’t take very long to go from no skill to [creating] something lethal. That’s how things are changing, the lethality and the ease of it.”PHOTOGRAPH: DAPHNE WESDORP\nThe first weapons that 3D manufactured for the revolution were FGC-9s, 3D-printed semiautomatic rifles. The blueprint for the weapon was created in 2018 by a gun designer using the pseudonym JStark1809. Over the course of several years, the designs were uploaded to several easily accessible online platforms, including Odysee, an open source blockchain-based media website. FGC stands for “fuck gun control,” as the gun can be manufactured without any regulated commercial gun components. It is composed of a mixture of custom 3D-printed parts, readily manufacturable metal components, and store-bought screws, springs, and bolts. JStark’s motto, “live free or die,” is engraved on a tag around 3D’s neck.\n3D produced the first FGC-9 in the early months of the coup, and the guns were used on the front line. But it soon became clear that plastic firearms weren’t up to the rigors of the battlefield, and the 3D-printed guns have been relegated to use in defensive actions or limited hit-and-run attacks. When it became clear there was no longer a need for plastic rifles, 3D started to think about how his 3D printer could help the revolution in different ways. So, in December 2022, he began working on a drone.\nInspired by a Ukrainian-made drone called the Punisher, the Liberator-MK1 was his first attempt. This small, fixed-wing reusable aircraft could carry up to 1.5 kilograms of explosives, and has already been deployed at Myanmar’s scattered front lines. The frame of the drone was 3D-printed and then covered with fiberglass. The other components—its battery, motor, and control surfaces—have to be smuggled across the border from Thailand. As cars and fuel are both expensive and scarce in rebel-held territories, the Liberator needed to be transportable by scooter, and therefore had to be compact. “There were so many things to take into account while making the design,” 3D says. “But the biggest problem we had was a weak wing structure. It couldn’t support the plane’s weight and broke in the middle.”In February this year, 3D refined the designs with the MK2. All told, it costs around $5,000 to produce a drone. Once all the components are in the country, they can be assembled in around two days.\nThe merging of 3D-printing technology and drone development has opened up new possibilities for both conventional military development as well as for non-state actors such as Myanmar’s anti-junta fighters. Military organizations have adopted 3D-printing technologies to produce sophisticated, low-cost, disposable aircraft—most visibly, and arguably most successfully, in Ukraine. This convergence has been particularly valuable to some non-state actors, like Myanmar’s rebel groups. When you lack foreign allies and your borders are sealed, you need to be innovative to get hold of weapons and bypass the conventional supply chain.\nGroups like the KNDF, which consists of mostly millennials and Gen Zs, thrive on having digital natives who can find and tweak designs online. Manuals on how to weaponize and build drones circulate online, and non-state actors often learn from the tactics of other groups that are disconnected from them, or even their enemy. When the war in Ukraine started, Ukrainians were even translating Islamic State manuals that contained instructions on how to weaponize drones, in order to prepare the population to wage an insurgency in case the Russians attacked. As Veilleux-Lepage says: “No technology is neutral. Every technology has essentially the purpose for which it is built, but can be used in various ways, by people with different ideologies.”\nIn Myanmar’s case, what these weaponized drones offer is an opportunity to strike back in an incredibly asymmetrical war. While the rebels struggle to access basic munitions, Myanmar’s military has obtained at least $1 billion in weaponry and materials needed to make weapons since the coup, according to a United Nations report that was published in May 2023. The cost of that imbalance is measured in lives. The past summer has been the deadliest for the pro-democracy rebels in the past two-and-a-half years, and casualties are reported daily.\nOn a misty morning, a dusty pickup arrives carrying the remains of a young fighter. “He died on the way here. He was injured in an airstrike,” the driver says. After the fighter is carried out of the car, a medic lifts his arm and inspects the fatal wound in his side, where a piece of shrapnel has pierced his body. On his arm, he has a self-made tattoo that says “happy,” covered in blood. To honor fallen fighters, three shots are fired in the air. “But even those shots are blanks,” says the deputy chief commander of the KNDF, who uses the alias “Maui” (named for the main character from the Disney film Moana—a giant, and the archetype of a warrior). “Ammunition is like gold for us. We don’t have the luxury to waste a single bullet.”\nWhile they’re training, KNDF volunteers are given only two .22-mm bullets to try to hit a target with. “The military junta can buy all the heavy weapons they want, but we barely have bullets to shoot with,” says Maui. “Real practice is done during active combat. But [the military] still can’t defeat us on the ground, so they attack us from the sky.”PHOTOGRAPH: DAPHNE WESDORP\nWith his drones, 3D hopes to redress that imbalance. One of his team members, a young man wearing a stained purple T-shirt, grumbles in irritation as he unsuccessfully attempts to set up the Liberator drone for a test run. “Bad compass health,” a voice from the drone repeats, as it lies on the dusty earth. “That means we have a problem with the compass,” 3D says, while he walks over to help his friend. “Without it, the drone won’t be able to be controlled properly.”\nTesting the drones is conducted at various undisclosed locations. There are spies, who might report on their position, but also junta scouting planes. When they hear the roar of an aircraft, 3D and the team operate like a well-oiled machine. Someone sprints to the drone, whose white fuselage stands out against the iron-rich red soil, and covers it with a dark net. The others hide between the foliage and under improvised bamboo roofs. Even though there is no way the scouting plane can hear their voices, no one speaks a word.\n“The launching process is the make-or-break moment,” 3D says after the scouting plane has passed. “Once it’s in the air, we know there’s no reason to worry, but sometimes it crashes due to malfunctions. There are many errors we need to consider. That’s why we continue to refine our designs. Several drones have already been lost in midair.”\nWhen everything is ready, a team member raises the drone high above their head in an open area, preparing for a running start. Once given the green light, he sprints a few meters, leaps, and releases the drone into the sky. 3D and the others cheer as the drone takes off, the craft growing smaller and smaller until it becomes merely a black dot against the blue sky. However, despite the promising launch from the ground, 3D’s expression soon turns to disappointment. “It fell about 500 meters from here,” he says.\nTwo members of the team jump on a scooter and drive off to the crash site. All that is left from the $5,000 drone is a small bundle of burned wires. 3D collects the parts that he hopes are still usable. He suspects a cable from the motor came loose, causing the drone to crash, which led to the battery exploding. “Off to the next one,” he says, with a strained laugh.\nEven though 3D’s drones have successfully attacked military command centers and outposts, it is not yet clear if they can indeed make a significant change on the battlefield. But right now, for Myanmar’s rebel groups, the Liberator is the only way to visit some of the same terror they experience on their enemy. “[The military] can’t win on the ground, so they resort to bombing us from above. We can’t defend ourselves. All we can do is hide,” 3D says. “Drones are the only thing we have to make them feel even a fraction of the trauma we feel when they bomb us with their fighter jets.”","tags":["","DRONES","DEFENSE","GUNS","3-D PRINTING","MILITARY"],"author":"BY DAPHNE WESDORP","creation_date":"2023-09-29"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/no-one-will-escape-the-ftx-fallout/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Try as they might, crypto companies pressured by the trading platform’s collapse are failing to bail themselves out.","title":"No One Will Escape the FTX Fallout","detailed_content":"GENESIS GLOBAL TRADING, one of crypto’s oldest and most storied institutions, is in dire straits. In November, in the wake of the implosion of the crypto exchange FTX, the company’s lending unit was forced to freeze customer withdrawals—never a good sign. Almost two months later, Genesis is reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy.\nAlthough Genesis has not said publicly that bankruptcy is imminent (Derar Islim, interim CEO, says he remains “focused on finding a solution”), the firm is reported to have laid off 30 percent of its workforce this week—the latest sign of its financial ill-health.\nFounded in 2013, Genesis has become central to the crypto industry’s day-to-day operations. In 2021 alone, the company issued $131 billion in loans and set up $116.5 billion in trades. To fund these loans, Genesis borrows from individuals and institutions that own large quantities of coins, also known as whales, who receive a cut of profits in return. \nWhile the crypto hype train barreled on unchecked, Genesis was on a hot streak—but its luck ran out in 2022. The lender has been in trouble since July, when hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed, taking with it $1.2 billion of the $2.36 billion it had borrowed from the firm. Genesis again found itself on the wrong side of a collapse in the autumn; when FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, the firm lost $175 million stored with the exchange.\nDigital Currency Group (DCG), parent company of Genesis, swooped in with bailouts on both occasions. Despite the assistance, the “unprecedented market turmoil” created by the FTX situation forced Genesis to freeze withdrawals and begin to hunt for emergency funding. But just like FTX, a rescue package for Genesis has not materialized.\nThe frothiness of the crypto market in 2021 spread fear of missing out among investors that attracted huge sums of money. But that FOMO is now long gone, replaced by a suspicion of both the promises and accounting practices of large crypto companies in light of the allegations of fraud at FTX.Venture capital investment in crypto is drying up, according to a recent paper released by market data house PitchBook. After a “breakout year” in 2021, in which $21 billion of capital flooded into the industry, appetite for crypto investment is collapsing rapidly. By Q3 2022, funding was down 34.3 percent year-on-year, and the volume of deals had fallen to a two-year low.\nIn Genesis’ case, investors have been put off by a lack of clarity over the size of the cash injection necessary to plug the hole, says David Bailey, CEO at Bitcoin Magazine, who also leads an activist group that represents the interests of investors in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a DCG subsidiary. He describes the shortfall as “massive and unknown in scope.”\nBrad Harrison, who leads the team behind decentralized lending protocol Venus, paints a similar picture. A Genesis bankruptcy would come as no surprise in the aftermath of the “tectonic” events that shook the crypto industry over the past year, he says. But as for the specifics, “we’re all just guessing what happens behind closed doors.”\nBailey also claims potential white knights have been spooked by the murky financial relationship between Genesis and DCG. Specifically, the “inappropriate intercompany loans” that were “only disclosed after everything went sideways.” These loans mean that “DCG has direct exposure to Genesis,” he explains. The parent company is “on the hook,” making it “tough to raise the funds it needs.” (DCG has been approached for comment; Silbert has previously suggested these intercompany loans are nothing out of the ordinary.) Genesis declined to comment.\nAlso “on the hook” is Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The company’s yield farming service, which allows customers to earn interest on their crypto, sits on top of the Genesis platform. But when the lender halted withdrawals, $900 million of Gemini customers’ assets were left stranded—and will remain so if Genesis declares bankruptcy.\nOn January 2, having grown frustrated with the lack of progress, Cameron Winklevoss delivered an ultimatum to Barry Silbert, founder of DCG. In an open letter published on Twitter, Winklevoss accused Silbert of “engaging in bad-faith stall tactics” and implored him to “commit to working together to solve this problem by January 8.” Silbert fired back, asserting that Winklevoss had misrepresented the situation, but did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Neither Gemini nor Winklevoss returned a request for clarification over what might happen if this deadline is missed.\nBack in November, Max Galka, founder of blockchain analytics company Elementus, told WIRED that Genesis is “an order of magnitude less intertwined than FTX” with other large industry players. The implication was that the ripple effects of a bankruptcy would be less severe, and fewer regular people would be caught up. But he also warned that the FTX fallout would not end with Genesis.\nHis prediction was confirmed yesterday when the NYSE-listed Silvergate Bank revealed in early quarterly filings that it was forced to offload $8.1 billion in assets to cover a surge in withdrawals triggered by the FTX debacle. The bank, which stores funds for many crypto companies—including FTX and its subsidiaries—said it had suffered losses of $718 million as a result of the forced sale. It will also have to “substantively reduce its workforce” in order to mitigate its new “economic realities.”\nUS regulators have made unsympathetic noises since the implosion of FTX. In an unprecedented joint statement on January 3, the US Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency told banks they serve cryptocurrency customers at their own peril.\nThe trio pointed to risks from “fraud and scams” to the potential for crypto firms to misrepresent their financial health. They also claimed that tokens stored on decentralized networks are “highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.”\nGenesis has tangled itself in its own financial gymnastics, while Silvergate has been caught in the crypto crossfire—and tarnished by association. The plight of both suggests that few in the crypto industry will escape the FTX saga unscathed. “Whenever there’s a hole like this,” Bailey says, “someone has got to eat shit.”","tags":["","BITCOIN","FINANCE","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2023-01-06"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-welcome-to-the-wet-hot-ai-chatbot-summer/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The next big thing in tech isn’t the blockchain or the metaverse—it’s a mind-bending wave of algorithmic content machines.","title":"Welcome to the Wet Hot AI Chatbot Summer","detailed_content":"LATE LAST YEAR, I attended an event hosted by Google to celebrate its AI advances.

But they’re far from a magic bullet.","title":"The Hidden Dangers of the Decentralized Web","detailed_content":"WHEN ELON MUSK took over Twitter last year, many users migrated to the free and open-source platform Mastodon. Mastodon, like other decentralized social media, isn’t owned by one of the major players in tech and doesn’t rely on one company’s centralized system. Instead, it operates on independently run servers. Other decentralized social media platforms, like Steemit, use blockchain technology to ensure that data can be stored on servers anywhere in the world.\nThe exodus from Twitter to Mastodon was spurred by wariness of Musk and concern that the platform would disintegrate in his hands. Indeed, distrust of established social media in general is high, thanks to data breaches, inconsistent leadership, and dubious geopolitical ties. In response, proponents of decentralized social networks claim that these alternatives increase transparency and give users more control over their online experiences. But decentralization also comes with downsides, many of which reflect larger cultural ills.\nWIRED OPINION\nABOUT\nJessica Maddox is an assistant professor of digital media technology at the University of Alabama.\nChief among the issues fomented by a decentralized web is a rise in conspiratorial thinking. As Virginia Commonwealth University professor David Golumbia argues in his book The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism, conspiracy theories that are deeply rooted in American life are governed by much of the same logic that underpins decentralized tech. Using cryptocurrency as an example, Golumbia charts how many of the beliefs held by die-hard proponents of bitcoin depend on far-right thinking. Decentralized banking relies on distrust in existing financial institutions, promising crypto-enthusiasts more control over their money. As a result, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may be attractive to individuals who think the US Federal Reserve is stealing value from ordinary people, or that “elites” have too much power and may be pulling the strings behind the government. More often than not, those elites are coded as “Jewish control,” playing into long-standing anti-Semitic tropes. While many individuals who invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not espouse these extremist, far-right views, the systems they are entering into often do.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow Online Conspiracy Groups Compare to Cults\nDecentralization emerges as the solution to seemingly questionable established institutions—be they banks or platforms—because it promotes individual ownership. It is predicated on seeking out a place to protect one’s self and one\u0027s specific group. Distrust, like that described by Golumbia, and the feelings prompting many to flee Twitter for Mastodon, often manifest into conspiracy, augmented when institutions are inconsistent or have acted badly. Pushing for decentralization doesn’t make users inherently conspiratorial. But when they decamp to a new platform—even one that is decentralized and purportedly more trustworthy—because they’re wary of the old one, they often bring this distrust-qua-conspiracy with them.\nDecentralized social media are also built to be suspect of the outside world. This is evident in Mastodon’s “federated network” of servers, which users connect across, much like how you can write to a Hotmail email from a Gmail account. New users pick one server to join when signing up, based on common interests or professional affiliation. However, these servers can also block each other. This is most likely a content moderation feature to promote safety, but it can also be used to hide things you disagree with or don’t want to see. For example, a Mastodon server of hundreds of journalists who joined after Musk began banning tech reporters on Twitter is currently blocked by over 200 other servers, who claim the reporters are malevolently surveilling others. It’s easy to imagine how decentralized and therefore more siloed online spaces like these federated Mastodon servers could wind up provoking conspiracy thinking.\nOn other decentralized Web3 platforms, conspiratorial ideologies come to the fore in more explicit ways. For example, Steemit’s instructions for new users advise that the first thing you should do when you join is to “write down your master/owner keys on a piece of paper, and keep the paper in a safe, secure place. Anyone can use your password to log in, to transfer money, to comment on others, and fish your friends. What would you call it? ‘Master/owner key’ is not enough.” The platform suggests that users must fence themselves off from the dangers of the digital world because other spaces and users cannot be trusted.These platforms have shortcomings on the practical level, as well. If a user needs a different app for everything they want to do online, we’re looking at a massive increase in app fatigue, the exhaustion that comes when users must download and engage with more platforms to have a semblance of an online presence and community. While the platforms offered by Meta and Alphabet are certainly not without issue, it is hard to deny the convenience of their established existence, which makes it possible to communicate, be entertained, shop, and more all in the same place. By contrast, users of decentralized platforms will need to download a slew of apps for everything they want to do online, because these features will no longer all exist in one place.\nThe specter of app fatigue may also make it more difficult to convince new users to join decentralized social media. While there will always be early adopters interested in coming on board, new platforms will need to meet casual users where they’re at to fully populate the decentralized web. But the language and features of Web3 are not always intuitive to individuals who are not habitually online, which could make it hard to boost uptake. This may be one reason the uptick in Mastodon users has stalled since its initial surge last fall.\nWe can, and should, always strive to build better, more accessible, and more inclusive technology. But decentralizing the web into walled-off silos seems unlikely to accomplish this goal. Platforms can never outrun their origin stories. Web3 will never be able to shed its conspiratorial origins. Distrust of existing tech institutions and separatist urges will always be part and parcel of decentralized social media. What that means moving forward remains to be seen, but conspiracy, distrust, and inclusion can certainly never go hand in hand.\nWIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of viewpoints.

Now companies may face a funding gap.","title":"How Silicon Valley Bank Became Startups’ Best Friend","detailed_content":"WHEN REAL-ESTATE-STARTUP COFOUNDER Vai Gupta visited downtown San Francisco from the suburbs last year, he borrowed a conference room at a branch of Silicon Valley Bank to host a quick business meeting, just like he has several times over the past decade. Gupta also has leaned on the bank for networking events, financial tutorials, and discount codes for business software and services. Other banks offer competing perks, but SVB’s total package had won Gupta’s loyalty, until the tech-focused financial giant cratered last week.\nNow Gupta is among thousands of customers wondering whether they will ever again find a financial institution that offers the unique blend of benefits, savvy, and speed that SVB delivered to entrepreneurs. Founded about 40 years ago by a Stanford University professor who teamed with banking experts after noticing students struggling to fund business ideas, Silicon Valley Bank treated startup founders like royalty long before their companies ever generated a profit or even raised significant funding.\nBy offering loans, guidance, and bountiful bottles of fine wine and all-expenses-paid ski trips to companies too small in sales for bigger banks to handhold, SVB quickly became the go-to bank for anyone intersecting with the San Francisco Bay Area’s globally known startup community. Clients who have grown with SVB’s help include Cisco, Coinbase, and Etsy.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nBut a bad bet on interest rates staying low—they have risen sharply since the start of 2022—and poor crisis communications led to its customers launching a run on the bank over fears about SVB’s financial health. Regulators took control of the bank on March 10, and the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in over the weekend to fully guarantee the remaining deposits.\nSVB’s future remains uncertain, and several entrepreneurs say they are finding that financial institutions rushing to fill the void are falling short in matching its suite of services and extras. Most of all, they wonder what it might mean for them and startups more broadly to lose a trusted partner that helped early-stage companies and founders survive difficult times and secure mortgages or loans others wouldn’t provide. \n“They understand our innovation ecosystem and build all of their offerings around that,” says Hemant Taneja, the chief executive and managing director of General Catalyst, a venture capital firm that banks with SVB. “They have the trust of the VC community that they will help these companies through thick and thin.”\nTaneja’s firm joined several others yesterday calling for companies to restore their deposits and lending with SVB, describing it as “now one of the safest and most secure banks in the country.” The bank posted on its website yesterday that under the oversight of federal regulators it is honoring all existing loans and welcoming new clients. SVB deferred a request for comment for this story to the FDIC, which declined the invitation. A source at the bank says a few dozen companies expressed interest yesterday in securing new loans.\nSVB\u0027s at-least temporary demise has added to existing economic uncertainty in tech. Rising interest rates have throttled startups’ access to cheap cash from investors over the past year. Losing access to the loans and connections that SVB provided could accelerate the collapse of some companies and force others to pare their ambitions—and potentially payrolls—until consumer and investor confidence in the economy rebounds.Gupta, the real estate entrepreneur, is already missing SVB. He wires money internationally at least a couple of times a month for his startup BonfireDAO, which aims to lower barriers to buying properties using blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. He estimates that Chase, his new bank, will charge him $5,000 a year for the transfers, which SVB provided for free.\nSVB also offered customers freebies through a dedicated section in its mobile app long before other banks dangled similar discounts to startups, says Gupta, who from SVB has taken advantage of Amazon Web Services cloud computing credits and free DocuSign e-signature services. He attended over a dozen SVB events, including sessions on finding cofounders and pitching investors. The bank would also let him stop by for a free lunch or to use a meeting room during business trips. “They were very hospitable,” Gupta says. He says he might now have to shell out for a WeWork membership.\nEntrepreneur Adam Zbar has enjoyed the use of an SVB ski house with a dock on California’s Lake Tahoe. As CEO of meal delivery company Sunbasket, he would use it to host weeklong retreats for his management team. The bank would bring in a top chef for a night and exclusive wines from SVB’s winery clients. “It was phenomenal,” Zbar says.\nSVB sponsorships also helped pay for trips for Los Angeles tech entrepreneurs to ski at Mammoth Mountain in California and surf at a human-made ranch constructed amid farms, says Zach James, co-CEO of ad tech company Zefr. SVB would take clients to race fancy cars, go backstage at music festivals, and meet vintners at private sessions at Napa Valley wineries to the point that it hosted 300 wine-related events one year.\nRivals had ramped up. JPMorgan Chase announced hiring several top bankers from SVB over the past few years. First Republic Bank was making progress adding tech clients. But their main focus remained elsewhere. \nLaw firms and recruiting and consulting companies are also major sponsors of tech industry schmoozing, though none of them—and certainly no other bank—came close to matching SVB’s largesse toward companies far away from listing on Wall Street, the entrepreneurs and several investors say. “They were one of the key underwriters of the community,” says Paige Craig, who has been a customer of the bank as an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist. “It’s a big hole to fill.”\nFor all the fancy perks, the ease of borrowing money from SVB has been the biggest draw for many companies. Startups take out bank loans to diversify their financing, and they often can secure the dollars without giving up as many shares as they have to provide venture investors.\nZefr’s James has taken out loans for his company several times through SVB after shopping around. In some cases, the bank takes a small ownership stake in the borrowers. Other times it defers principal payments for a year or two or allows for repayment in a single lump sum. “It was the catch-all for startups,” James says of SVB.Generally, it offered among the least-restrictive terms and equally competitive interest rates, entrepreneurs say. If a borrower failed, SVB was known to handle it more gracefully than other lenders. Effectively, according to language seen by WIRED, SVB would support companies as long as their venture capital backers, often clients of the bank, did not abandon them. “Bankers become a lifeline when you get into trouble, and if they stand by you, I take that seriously,” says James of his loyalty to the now crushed bank. \nRoger Smith, SVB’s founding CEO, told the Computer History Museum in 2014 that the bank did not sacrifice profits by being flexible. “When the music stops, we want two chairs, not just one,” he said. “But we were able to help people grow and … we were part of the flow.”\nJust ask Zbar, the former Sunbasket chief. He dreamed up the meal delivery company in 2013 after he had spent through the venture funding he had raised for a different idea. He had no money to pay back a bank loan. But his banker at SVB loved the Sunbasket pitch, and investors were supportive, so SVB agreed to allow Zbar to keep operating month-to-month on new terms as the food venture progressed.\n“I remember having some unpleasant conversations where I was like, wow, you know, you took a piece of my hide, but my business still survived,” says Zbar, now chief executive of HamsaPay, which uses blockchain for commercial loan financing. He believes other banks are less flexible than SVB. “They just freeze it, and you\u0027re done,” he says.  Zbar even welcomed his SVB banker as a bachelor-party guest. \nTo be sure, Silicon Valley Bank’s reliance on relationships and knowledge of venture capitalists to guide its lending decisions raises questions about whether it perpetuated exclusion of women, racial minorities, or other groups historically overlooked by the startup financing industry. Investors say some of those issues may be valid, but the bank did open up opportunities.\nSVB fronted cash to people of underrepresented backgrounds trying to buy into venture capital funds, says the investor Craig, who runs Outlander VC. It provided home mortgages to investors early in their careers who couldn’t get them elsewhere, based on a deep understanding of the tech companies its customers were betting on, Craig says. “I really hope they rebuild and reconstitute. No one understood founders and innovators as well as SVB,” he says.  \nAs entrepreneurs have fanned out to other banks in recent days to shift their deposits from SVB, their experiences have reminded them of what they enjoyed about SVB. James’ Zefr has not found a single bank that can offer every service he wants, so he is using one to borrow money and another for conventional accounts. He does not expect Zefr’s growth to slow, but says his company “will have to suffer worse terms or take on a bit more risk.”\nGupta, who is chief technology officer of BonfireDAO, recalls how he was able to open an account with SVB entirely online while in Singapore at his previous startup a decade ago, an option he has not found as he now searches for SVB alternatives. “They were just the first one to really propose solutions,” he says of his early interactions with SVB. “I never shopped around again.”\nHe wrote on LinkedIn last week that “many startups like [his] have lost a valuable friend, partner, and source of support.” He says his heart wants to stick with SVB if it resurrects, but he’s no longer sure it’s financially prudent to do so, no matter the constant aid, invaluable discounts, or occasional free conference room.","tags":["","FINANCE","VENTURE CAPITAL","STARTUPS","MONEY","CRYPTOCURRENCY"],"author":"BY PARESH DAVE","creation_date":"2023-03-15"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/def-jam-signs-nft-whales/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The famous label’s new deal with a virtual band is being called “metaverse music history in the making.” I have questions.","title":"Def Jam Just Signed a Bunch of NFT Whales","detailed_content":"THE MONITOR IS a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.","tags":["","THE MONITOR","MUSIC","NFTS","METAVERSE"],"author":"BY ANGELA WATERCUTTER","creation_date":"2023-02-10"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-578/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"This week on Gadget Lab, we talk about the development of the Ledger Stax, a cryptocurrency wallet designed by Tony Fadell.","title":"You’re Gonna Need a Crypto Wallet","detailed_content":"EVEN IF YOU own no bitcoin, no ether, and no NFTs, crypto wallets—pocket-friendly hardware lockers that store digital assets—will be a part of your future.

I\u0027m a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We\u0027re also joined this week, once again, by WIRED editor at large Steven Levy. Steven, welcome back to the show.\nSteven Levy: Thank you. It was always a thrill to be on the show.\nLauren Goode: Steven, we have to tell you that as we were reading your latest feature and preparing for this show, Mike and I looked at each other and said, “Steven\u0027s a really good writer.” We knew that already, of course. But it was underscored. You really are. It\u0027s like you\u0027ve been doing it for a while. A fantastic writer.\nSteven Levy: I think I have a pretty good lead on everyone else for the most features in WIRED magazine.\nLauren Goode: Incredible.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to challenge you on that.\nLauren Goode: No, we\u0027re never going to catch up.\nMichael Calore: Well, Steven, your latest feature for WIRED is a story about cryptocurrency. Most of our listeners probably know at this point that we are in the midst of a crypto winter where the values of many digital currencies have fallen. Exchanges are under intense scrutiny. The NFT market has crashed, and the whole scene is going through a lot of difficult times. So this particular moment feels like the right time to step back and take a long-term look at the crypto world and think about where it might be going in the next few years. Now, one company thinking far into the future is Ledger. Steven just wrote a big story for WIRED about this company, a French business that sells cryptocurrency wallets. Ledger\u0027s newest wallet is called Stax. It\u0027s making waves primarily because it\u0027s designed by Tony Fadell, the guy behind the iPod and the iPhone and the Nest thermostat. Tony\u0027s a big deal. If Tony Fadell is making Ledger\u0027s next crypto wallet, then it\u0027ll get the attention of more than just the crypto bros. But let\u0027s start with some basics. Steven, can you please tell us what is a cryptocurrency wallet?Steven Levy: Right, OK. So the wallet we\u0027re talking about is something that holds not only cryptocurrency but other kinds of digital assets, which could range from NFTs to papers about your identity. Think of it as a tiny secure vault that holds your private key, which is sort of a stamp you make to authenticate that you are you. So when you have a crypto asset, whether it\u0027s a bitcoin or an NFT, it lives on this ledger called the blockchain. And your direct connection is that the owner of the digital asset is logged on this ledger. So the question is, how do you prove that it\u0027s you? How do you prove that you\u0027re the owner? And that\u0027s because there\u0027s a little key, which when you unlock it, it says, bam, it\u0027s you. And you have to hold this key in the tightest, most secure place, because anyone who has the key is automatically the owner. It\u0027s definitional: The person who has the key owns that asset. So the crypto wallet is a way where that power is literally in your hands, where you have this piece of hardware which holds that digital key very, very closely. And if it hasn\u0027t been hacked, so as you mentioned, that\u0027s very important. You can prove that those assets are yours.\nLauren Goode: How does this differ from using something like secure ID on an iPhone? Apple often talks about how secure it is to use something like face unlock and store your biometric info on their secure ID. Because that is something that the company does not have access to, and you\u0027re sort of holding that in your hand. How is this different?\nSteven Levy: Well, one thing I learned about studying crypto, and I actually wrote a book about it at one point, is that the amount of effort you put into protecting something pretty much has to be in sync with how important it is to protect it. So if it\u0027s very, very, very important, you need the most secure way to lock something down. And as it turns out, the phone is not the most secure way. There\u0027s companies that sell to other governments a way to hack it outright. And the biometrics like face recognition and fingerprints you use can be relatively easy to hack. They\u0027re public, people can see your face, they can fake it, they can get your fingerprint, they can cut your finger off. I just watched the movie about that, where some guy cut his finger off.\nLauren Goode: Let\u0027s put a pin in that and come back to it.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, it\u0027s not the most secure way to do things. So this company has put its bet on people saying, “Hey, if I\u0027m going to have these digital assets that are so secure, I don\u0027t have to trust anyone in the world, any kind of institution or bank or anyone else, I want maximum security.” And that can only come from something which is an unhackable way to protect your key.Michael Calore: So this company that you wrote about, Ledger, they make these cryptocurrency wallets. That\u0027s their primary business. Tell us more about Ledger.\nSteven Levy: So Ledger is a French company, which in 2014 began making these wallets. So not the only company that makes them, but they become the leader of the field. And right now they look like an old USB stick, the kind that had a jackknife sort of scheme where you put a metal sheath over it and flipped it open. And right now the passcode you use is in this tiny little microscopic display they have, and it isn\u0027t even a keypad. It\u0027s hard to use, but it\u0027s very, very secure. And I think something like 20 percent of the world\u0027s cryptocurrency is protected by Ledger wallets and maybe 30 percent of NFTs. So they\u0027re definitely one of the leading companies in the field. But still, it\u0027s pretty hard to use, it\u0027s something really reserved for the hardcore crypto crowd. So my story begins when the people at Ledger thought, “Gee, how can we open this up and appeal to an audience beyond the geeks, beyond the crypto bros, and make it so a wider swath of the population can adopt this technology?”\nLauren Goode: So enter Tony Fadell. To be clear, he didn\u0027t found Ledger, but he got involved a little bit later because something was really irking him about the products. He was consulting, and then he ended up saying, “Let\u0027s redesign the whole thing.” Talk about that.\nSteven Levy: Even before Tony, there was another person named Ian Rogers who came to the company, and this guy\u0027s a fascinating guy. I mentioned that he had a lot of trophy jobs, but trophies they usually don\u0027t find in the same case. He was kind of a skateboard kid who took computer science and worked at Yahoo and headed Yahoo Music. And then he went to work for Beats and did their music software and then started Apple Music when Apple bought Beats. And then he became the head of these luxury fashion brands. And the CEO of Ledger, this guy named Pascal Gauthier, thought, “I need Americans to market my product, because the French are too stodgy and I want to be a global company.” So he tapped this guy Ian to come and work for him, but Ian had a friend in Paris who he said, “Can you look into this for me?” And that friend was Tony Fadell. And Tony, in doing due diligence, got excited about the prospect of rethinking the crypto wallet and agreed to do the redesign for a wallet. He didn\u0027t join the company; he got a little piece of the company, but he became the defacto design head and father of this new product called Stax.\nLauren Goode: And you mentioned earlier that some of the previous crypto wallets from Ledger, they had a tiny screen, they weren\u0027t super easy to unlock, and in your story you mentioned that the directions say, allow yourself 30 minutes to even set this thing up. And then in comes Mr. iPod, who reinvented the literal wheel. So what was his vision for this new wallet?Steven Levy: So he looked at this and he thought, “Gee, this is just like digital music was when I was charged to lead the iPod project from Steve Jobs.” The first MP3 players were really clunky to use; it was hard to even pick out the single song you wanted to listen to. They were bulky, and they were definitely not cool and fun. So he said, “I could do the same thing for wallets. Instead of having this tiny little display and no buttons, I could do a touchscreen. And what\u0027s more, I can make the touchscreen really cool in a credit-card-size device. Where this screen, and it\u0027s an E Ink screen, wraps around the side, and on the side you could read it like the spine of a book. And maybe you\u0027ll have a bunch of different assets in different categories that you could use together, and you could stack them up like a big pile of a hundred dollars bills.” So they made them magnetic so they would snap in order. And you could put your NFTs on the display. They had a long battery life so you could put it in a drawer and it would be good for months. So he decided to make this thing easier to use and cooler, and sell it for a reasonable price and make it a more welcoming product for people considering getting into self custody for digital assets.\nMichael Calore: I think both Ian Rogers and Tony Fadell told you at some point in your reporting, and this is in the story, that they believed that what we\u0027re looking at right now is a moment that goes back to about 15 years ago. When most people believed that when the iPhone came out, that it wouldn\u0027t necessarily be a product for everybody. Not everybody is going to want a smartphone. That was obviously wrong. And Ian Rogers says that something similar is happening right now with cryptocurrency, where it doesn\u0027t really feel super vital to daily life for everyone at the moment. But that in the future, most humans will end up owning digital assets. I wonder if that\u0027s really true.\nSteven Levy: I think the long-term vision is valid. Ian said something really interesting to me. He said he attended a conference in New York recently, and it was a bunch of crypto people and you needed a crypto token to actually get in. It was your ticket. And he thought how weird it was that the technology he used to get into this party basically was more secure, more sophisticated, and easier to use than what you used to get into a country. I think eventually you can make the case that our passports will be digital assets and our driver\u0027s licenses and our Taylor Swift tickets. It\u0027ll be a long process. But I think it makes sense that somewhere down the line, I don\u0027t want to put how many years it\u0027s going to take, that this is going to be the way that we hold everything dear to us that can be digitized.Lauren Goode: As I was reading this story, that\u0027s exactly what I was thinking. I was wondering if it was eventually going to become more than just a crypto wallet. If it was going to store our passports and licenses and vaccine cards. Because as someone who loses things quite a bit, I was thinking, “OK, this thing is $249. I would probably spend that amount on a really secure digital wallet if it meant I wasn\u0027t replacing all the other things I lose throughout the year.”\nMichael Calore: And just don\u0027t lose your wallet.\nSteven Levy: But definitely, I think that\u0027s it. Now, they don\u0027t have a clear roadmap on how to make this happen in two years. And Ian actually said to me, “I\u0027m a little wary that we\u0027re going to be like the Nokia or Blackberry of this space.” Because they\u0027re there now, and maybe down the road someone will come up. But right now their hope is to build this big head start, and since they\u0027re already the most popular product in this pre-cool-device era of wallets, yhey\u0027re hoping they can just put the stake in the ground, and as this happens, they will be the platform that people use for these other digital assets.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, let\u0027s take a quick break and we\u0027ll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right, welcome back. Now obviously, when Ledger first started planning the Stax release and got Fadell involved to build it, the crypto world was doing OK, and then a lot of cryptocurrencies tumbled in value. The NFT market crashed, and now the FTX Exchange is the target of a fraud investigation. And the whole crypto world seems to be in a pretty serious crisis. Some people might point to all of the recent news and say, “Wow, lousy timing for Ledger to release this wallet.” But others like Fadell and his team would say, “No, this is actually perfect timing.”\nSteven Levy: That\u0027s right. It is been a challenging year for crypto in general, but not disastrous. At the time, I went to Paris and had to suffer my way through the City of Lights while reporting the story. A couple weeks later, the team came to New York, and during that period we learned about FTX and SBF, and the whole crypto market just collapsed and was shrouded in doubt and fear and loathing. So when I brought this up to them, they said, “Well, we\u0027re the solution.” And they noted to me, and we had discussed this before, then when your money is in a crypto exchange like FTX, it\u0027s the same principle as a bank. If you have money in a bank, they don\u0027t earmark your dollars with your name on it in a red marker. They just put it in a big pile. And if everyone wants it all at once, they have to have enough money to pay people back. If they don\u0027t, it\u0027s a big trouble. As Samuel Bankman-Fried learned, and we all learned from FTX, with self custody, it doesn\u0027t work that way. The money is actually earmarked for you and linked to your little private key. So that could not happen if your money was protected by self-custody and a crypto wallet. The question is how successful the whole market is going to be. Whether this casts a big enough shadow on the whole crypto market that people are going to ignore it. I said, “Is this going to be introducing a great cocktail on the Titanic just before it hits the iceberg?”Lauren Goode: So wait a second. If someone had, let\u0027s say, made an investment that was tied to Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s coin FTT, or let\u0027s say they invested directly in the FTT coin, and it was stored on a ledger wallet. Then if the value of that coin goes down significantly, how does having it on a ledger wallet, a hard wallet make it any different than just having it stored in an exchange or having a record of it on an exchange?\nSteven Levy: Well, if the currency itself is worthless, you\u0027re right. But if you are trying to get your assets, a lot of people had their money not in the magic beans that SPF invented, but in bitcoin and ether and other markers of value that still have some value. If they have their money in there, and they couldn\u0027t get it out, they couldn\u0027t get it paid back. So if money is involved in a currency which is worth something, you could recover it. In this case, there was real money that disappeared. They said, “Oh, there\u0027s a line in the spreadsheet for 8 billion that we forgot about.” Kind of like, “There\u0027s one little line, and if you want your money back, sorry, we can\u0027t deliver that because this line in the spreadsheet disappeared.” And if you buy an NFT, at the least you want to say that my ownership in this NFT is verified. And I don\u0027t have to trust anyone else to be able to claim what I purchased.\nLauren Goode: I think I\u0027m still trying to wrap my brain around the idea of a hard wallet and what it points to if you were to use an analog to a current banking app. When I use authentication on my iPhone to get into my current banking app, I don\u0027t believe that what I\u0027m looking at is the actual repository of dollars. I\u0027m looking at a digital representation of dollars that are stored somewhere else. With the hard wallet, it\u0027s another form of identity verification, and it\u0027s holding the keys that point to assets that are somewhere else.\nSteven Levy: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Am I understanding that? It\u0027s not like you\u0027re looking at the NFT itself on this little wallet.\nSteven Levy: The difference is that with your bank, there\u0027s a third party involved that you have to trust. If your bank goes bust, you might have had a thousand dollars in that bank, but you\u0027re not getting that thousand dollars. This is more like saying, “I have a thousand dollars in a safety deposit in this bank, the bank went broke, but I still have access to the safe deposit box.”\nMichael Calore: That\u0027s a good analogy. I think the idea of a cryptocurrency wallet saves us from some of the abstraction that\u0027s involved when thinking about exchanges. Because it\u0027s a physical token that you hold in your hand that you can manipulate via the touchscreen if you have a Stax. And it\u0027s not something that sort of exists in the sky that you access through a browser. So I do think that eliminating that abstraction of dealing with exchanges is helpful for the cryptocurrency market. Because it gives something that people who are less familiar with it or who still find it confusing and weirdly obfuscated, it gives them something to literally hold on to, literally and figuratively hold on to. And I know that that was Fadell and Roger\u0027s goal in building this wallet, making something that was even more accessible to get people into wallets. And I think maybe the real hump they have to get over is not giving people something that they can use to help them understand cryptocurrency. But giving them something that they can use to help them understand the difference between a physical wallet and an exchange.Steven Levy: And the idea is, and I didn\u0027t really realize this until I did the story, is that the word trust is a pejorative in this world. The idea that you have to trust someone is anathema to the true crypto people. They don\u0027t want trustworthy places to deal with, because that implies that you have to extend trust. They want trust-proof systems where you don\u0027t have to rely on anyone, no matter how trustworthy they look. So again, it muddies the conversation to limit it to talk about cryptocurrencies, because as Lauren pointed out, cryptocurrencies might go bust. It\u0027s more to say digital assets, digital identity markers that are going to be protected in your digital vault. Because these things are emblazoned on the ledger that there\u0027s many copies of, and you can\u0027t forge it. And then you have the direct connection with your private key and that you don\u0027t really do other kinds of manipulation with this wallet. It\u0027s almost like in medieval times, they had a seal, and you had your own personal seal that you would stamp it with to verify it\u0027s you. This is a much more secure, high-tech version of that. You don\u0027t need to trust anyone. I mentioned Taylor Swift tickets—they\u0027re super, super valuable. If you want a non-forgeable Taylor Swift ticket, this would be the way to do it. You wouldn\u0027t have to trust a scalper, you wouldn\u0027t have to trust Ticketmaster. That would be your proof that you\u0027re the owner of a general admission ticket to see Taylor Swift.\nLauren Goode: Steven, before we go, I have to ask you, have you purchased a Ledger Stax wallet, and are you investing in crypto?\nSteven Levy: Well, I don\u0027t have the new one yet. They did send me the current version to test out, and I managed to get it going. But I actually came down with Covid before I actually wanted to confer with their people, before I moved my wealth of crypto assets over to it. I wrote about this, I do own some crypto because in 2014 I went to a demo of a bitcoin ATM and put $20 in and at one point it got to be a lot of money. But now it\u0027s still worth over a thousand dollars.\nLauren Goode: Nice.\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nSteven Levy: Which I thought was ironic, because all these investors were going to this Y Combinator Demo Day figuring out which company would be a return on their investment. And they just should have funneled a lot of money into that ATM machine, they would\u0027ve done better.\nLauren Goode: But what I\u0027m hearing you say is that, and by the way, we\u0027re sorry that you were dealing with Covid, and we\u0027re glad that you\u0027re better and back on the show. But it sounds like you are waiting for something to move those crypto assets onto this new wallet. Does that mean you don\u0027t fully trust it?Steven Levy: I don\u0027t trust myself to do it correctly. And this is the one scary part about wallets, is ultimately the responsibility is yours. If someone gets your passcode and the passcode for these wallets … the way the private key is generated, I think like 26 different words that you have to write down. And if you lose that, and if someone else comes across it, they can basically claim your assets. So it\u0027s up to you to protect your password for that private key. And if you screw up, it\u0027s gone.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Well don\u0027t screw up.\nSteven Levy: Yeah. Well, yeah. I don\u0027t want to lose my fortune in bitcoin.\nMichael Calore: All right, let\u0027s take another break, and when we come back we\u0027ll do recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: OK. Steven Levy, you are our guest. So please tell us, what do you recommend to our listeners that they check out.\nSteven Levy: Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: Paxlovid?\nSteven Levy: Yes. It\u0027s this medicine, this drug that is an option to take, and you get it free, the government pays for it actually. If you\u0027ve come down with Covid and you do it in the first five days of symptoms, it can lessen the symptoms by maybe a couple days. And cut the odds if you\u0027ve been vaccinated, they\u0027re already pretty low, but further cut them, that serious bad things will happen. The drawback is that it tastes very bad. And in my newsletter I did some tasting notes and I said, “There\u0027s a bouquet of a porta potty and an underfunded jam band concert.” And other kinds of things. To me, because I had some very uncomfortable flu-like symptoms to cut a couple days out of, that was worth it. So I recommend Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: That\u0027s great. And I know that if you have symptoms and you\u0027re worried that you might have Covid, and you go to get tested at a facility like a hospital or a public testing site or the local library or your doctor\u0027s office, they will ask you if you are you interested in receiving Paxlovid. And they\u0027ll give it to you if you do test positive.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, it\u0027s very easy to get. Originally when they first came out, it was tough to get. Now it\u0027s super easy. Basically, my doctor, who I had a telemedicine appointment with, went over with it, and actually he was sort of on the fence. Because some people reported you get a bounce back, so you have to sort of crunch some numbers. Supposedly it lessens the odds you\u0027ll get long Covid. But I weighed all the factors and decided to get it. And my pharmacy delivered it within an hour from there. So I took the five days of Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: And you can taste things again now.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, yeah. I never lost my sense of taste, but I was hyper aware of the taste of Paxlovid.Lauren Goode: Once again, Steven, we\u0027re very glad that you have recovered.\nSteven Levy: Well, thank you.\nMichael Calore: Indeed. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is going to seem rather nonessential compared to Steven\u0027s. But if you happen to be, oh, I don\u0027t know, staying home with Covid and you\u0027re looking for something to watch, I recommend White Lotus season two. I recommended this earlier this year when I first started watching it. Now the season has wrapped up. It\u0027s an incredible series; check it out. Don\u0027t go on Instagram if you don\u0027t want it spoiled for you. If you don\u0027t want to know who dies. I recommend staying away from Evan Ross Katz\u0027s profile in particular, because he screenshots a lot of memes from the show. He\u0027s hilarious. But yeah, White Lotus season two, just to follow up on that one. And then my actual recommendation this week is related to our podcast producer, Boone Ashworth, because Boone uses these amazing pens. They\u0027re by the brand Zebra, they\u0027re called the Sarasa, what are they called?\nMichael Calore: Sarasa Grand.\nLauren Goode: Sarasa Grand, they\u0027re these amazing gel weighted pens. And our pod here, not our podcast pod, but our pod at work here, we sometimes exchange some holiday gifts. And Boone, after I raved about his pen the other day, he was kind enough to get me a gift set of the Zebra Sarasa Grand pens, and they\u0027re awesome. So thank you, Boone. And if you\u0027re looking for a good pen or a nice little gift set to give to someone who likes pens, I recommend these.\nMichael Calore: Lauren says we sometimes exchange gifts because some of us have exchanged gifts, but I being the cad and forgetting that most people are not going to be around next week, I haven\u0027t gotten anybody gifts yet. So hang tight you all.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s OK. Your presence is a gift.\nMichael Calore: No, yeah, it is. But also I do have things in mind that I\u0027m going to get you. So please hold for those. I appreciate it.\nLauren Goode: And Mike, what\u0027s your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: OK. My recommendation is on-topic for this week, because last week I was going through our storage closet here at work, and I found a Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin Air, which was the big sort of dooby-shaped black speaker that you put an iPod on. And it has a 30-pin connector on top of it. So it\u0027s like an iPod dock, but it\u0027s amazing. It sounds wonderful. I think it was a thousand dollars when it came out. So I went further into the closet, and I found my old iPod, and I charged it up and I put it on that thing. And I spent two days just listening to my iPod. And I have to say, owning music and listening to music that you own on a device that is not connected to the internet just feels different. There\u0027s something about it. There\u0027s something that is sort of like you are settling for what\u0027s in your library and not constantly poking around for something else to listen to. There is nothing else to listen to. You have very limited choice, and it really helps you make focused decisions about what you\u0027re listening to. So I\u0027m the type of person who fills as many minutes of my day with music as I can, at work, while I\u0027m walking around, at home, while I\u0027m in the kitchen. Even when I\u0027m going to sleep, I listen to music. So having this iPod and having a limited choice of things to listen to has made me revisit a bunch of albums that I normally would not pick if I was just surfing Spotify. So if you have an iPod and you haven\u0027t listened to it in a while, bust it out, because there\u0027s all kinds of great music on there that you actually own.Steven Levy: Well, here\u0027s the thing. I have an iPod Classic, the last one with a good hard drive. And I\u0027m terrified that it\u0027s going to die, because when it dies, you can\u0027t replace it. So I love to listen to that iPod on a plane ride where I can shuffle my whole collection. But I have to judge whether the trip is going to be worth it to take it, and spend some more time in what is ultimately a limited amount of life left in this pod. So the question is, is this trip iPod-worthy, in the sense that in Seinfeld, Elaine had the sponge-worthy metric on whether she wanted to use a certain kind of contraceptive. So I\u0027m constantly thinking, \"Gee, do I want to listen to music enough to pull out my great clickwheel iPod? Is this iPod-worthy?\"\nMichael Calore: Well, I\u0027ll say two things. One, that you can still get iPods. You can buy them on the internet, you can refurbish them, you can get a tool kit and get a hard drive and pop them open and replace the hard drive inside of them. If the hard drive dies, of course, you have to refill it with music, but you can still plug a USB cable somehow into your computer and refill it with music if you have to. So I wouldn\u0027t worry so much about losing that particular piece of hardware, because the hardware still for the next few years anyway, will be replaceable. The second thing I\u0027ll say is, ride it into the ground. Absolutely. Break that thing. Listen to it so much that it falls apart.\nSteven Levy: Well, after Covid it\u0027s all carpe diem for me. So I guess I\u0027ll take your advice.\nLauren Goode: There was a period of time when I was using this little waterproofed iPod. What was it, the Nano?\nMichael Calore: The Nano.\nLauren Goode: The one that doesn\u0027t have any screen, just the clickwheel.\nMichael Calore: Oh, that\u0027s the Shuffle.\nLauren Goode: The Shuffle.\nMichael Calore: The first Shuffle.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I found this company, I wrote about them at one of my previous jobs. This company, I want to say they were in, I don\u0027t remember where they were, Oregon maybe, Washington state. And it was just a father-and-son team who would buy these iPod Shuffles in bulk, and then they would waterproof them, and they were for swimming. And they were great. I bought these little waterproof headphones, I clipped the iPod Shuffle to the strap of my bathing suit. And I would listen to music as I was swimming laps. I loved it.\nMichael Calore: That\u0027s great.\nLauren Goode: Loved it. And then eventually, I think it just, no matter how well you waterproof it, it got corroded, because it was really not designed to be underwater. Pretty cool though. That\u0027s the last one I used.\nMichael Calore: Oh, that\u0027s great. All right, well that is our show for this week. Steven, thank you again for joining us.\nSteven Levy: It was all I hoped for. Thank you.\nMichael Calore: And we\u0027re glad that you\u0027re feeling better. It\u0027s good to see you.\nSteven Levy: Thank you.\nMichael Calore: And thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter, still there. Just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth, and we will be back next week.

Or at least it was, until crypto exchange FTX made the island of New Providence the setting for a historic crypto collapse in early November. \nBahamas-headquartered FTX declared bankruptcy on November 11, and founder Sam Bankman-Fried retreated into hiding. The exchange’s collapse took with it hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds. The feeling in crypto circles now, says Nicholas Rees, cofounder of Bahamas-based payments firm Kanoo Pays, is of “complete and utter shock.”\nAs other senior FTX employees fled the country, they were replaced by a throng of reporters and crypto influencers heading in the opposite direction, hoping to locate the disgraced crypto wunderkind.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nBankman-Fried was ultimately arrested at his $40 million penthouse by Bahamian police on December 12 under the instruction of US law enforcement. He has since been extradited to the US, and on January 3 pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and commodities fraud.\nWhile Bankman-Fried awaits his trial, penciled for October 2023, members of the Bahamas’ crypto scene are left to pick up the pieces, their reputations impacted by proximity.\nBy virtue of its size and standing, says Rees, FTX’s tendrils extended into many corners of Nassau, the capital city—whether through charitable donations, corporate deals, or events that brought custom to the doors of local businesses. The crypto exchange also cohosted an invite-only conference in July last year, boasting a roster of speakers that included Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and football player Tom Brady.\nThe Kanoo Innovation Hub, a startup accelerator launched by Kanoo Pays, was mere days away from announcing a partnership with FTX when the scandal broke. Rees claims FTX intended to create a way for accelerator participants to tap into the $100 million pool of capital already set aside for local investments. (FTX did not respond to a request for confirmation of the agreement.)Although the survival of the Innovation Hub is not contingent on FTX funding, Rees says the collaboration promised to take the scheme “to another level,” providing a leg up to founders from the Caribbean.\nWorse, Rees explains, the collapse of FTX created an employment vacuum that deprived Bahamians of both their current jobs and potential career opportunities. “The saddest part for us, outside the millions of people that lost money,” he says, “is that some of our countrymen would have received the job of a lifetime, but it was pulled out from under them.”\nAlthough groups of crypto enthusiasts already existed, the Bahamas began to formally establish itself as a crypto hub in late 2020 with the passing of the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Act.\nAt the time, it was among the only pieces of fully-fledged crypto legislation worldwide, says Caroline Malcolm, head of international public policy at blockchain data firm Chainalysis. It  established a clear set of rules for crypto companies, unavailable in most other jurisdictions, and ensured businesses that engaged in malpractice could be held to account. \nIn the two years since, a collection of startups and large crypto companies have set up shop in the Bahamas, among them FTX and OKX, another large crypto exchange. Separately, Tether, whose dollar-pegged stablecoin is central to the smooth operation of crypto markets, holds its reserves with a Bahamian bank, Deltec Bank \u0026 Trust.\nBut already, signs of damage dealt by the FTX collapse to the Bahamas’ status as an emerging crypto capital are beginning to show.\nIn December, SALT, the events company led by former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, announced the cancellation of Crypto Bahamas 2023. Another event, D3 Bahamas, run by the Bahamas government and billed as the country’s “flagship Web3 and financial technology festival,” was due to take place this January, but has been postponed. A new date has not yet been set.\nCarlyle Bethel, founder of real estate tokenization startup Akerage, was due to pitch for venture capital funding at D3 and describes the postponement as “disheartening.” His chief concern is that the FTX collapse has “shaken potential investors,” making it more difficult for startups like his to bring onboard the funding they need to scale.\nAs for other global crypto businesses with ties to the Bahamas, the response has been mixed. Tether is unmoved; Paolo Ardoino, CTO, says the FTX situation is in no way a reflection of the Bahamas and that Tether is “strongly considering” opening an office there. OKX, however, declined to answer questions about its commitment to the country.\nNassau is also home to a growing brigade of crypto startups, like oceanfront coworking space Crypto Isle, which aims to bring together isolated groups of entrepreneurs and “create a space for people to learn about crypto,” says cofounder Davinia Bain. \nOther startups work alongside the Caribbean Blockchain Alliance, an NGO that advocates for the adoption of blockchain technology in the region. Stefen Deleveaux, president of the organization, describes the crypto scene in the Bahamas as “small, but active and growing.”Neither Bain nor Deleveaux expressed particular concern about the knock-on effects FTX could have on local crypto businesses. With the exception of a few companies that were anticipating direct funding from FTX’s venture capital division, Bain says “the mood at Crypto Isle hasn’t changed.” Deleveaux points to the “massive potential” of the local grassroots crypto movement, which is “quite ready to move on” from FTX.\nOthers see things slightly differently, though. Although Rees is confident in the quality of Bahamian crypto startups, he says the collapse of FTX is “not good for the industry.”\nSpecifically, he is concerned that people typically fail to distinguish between the actions of a company (or handful of individuals within a company) and the industry and nation in which it operates. As a result, crypto companies in the Bahamas face a tarring—even firms like Kanoo Pays, which deals predominantly in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the antithesis of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nIn the two months since FTX collapsed, the Bahamas’ willful embrace of crypto has come under the microscope, along with its approach to regulating the industry. And Philip Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas, has had to come out on the defensive.\nNew crypto regulations under the DARE Act had been proposed long before the FTX allegations emerged. A report published in April 2022 by the Bahamian government set out a “vision” for capitalizing further on the “remarkable opportunity” presented by digital assets. But framed by the FTX debacle, it makes for difficult reading.\nThe plan, which included provisions relating to crypto trends like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi), promised to cement the country’s reputation as a “leading digital asset hub,” the report asserted—but also to ensure that “only well-run, trustworthy, and thriving digital asset businesses, which are able to … sustain the good reputation of The Bahamas, are allowed to operate from the country.” Ouch.\nThe Bahamas Securities Commission, which consulted on the report, declined to comment on how the FTX collapse might inform regulatory reform. The office of the prime minister did not return requests for comment.\nBut Malcolm says DARE cannot have enabled the alleged FTX fraud, which is covered off by provisions that require businesses to “maintain adequate controls, safeguard investor assets, [and] maintain adequate financial resources.” She describes the idea as “a massive mischaracterization” that paints an unfair picture of the Bahamas.\nBain also takes issue with the light in which the country has been cast by the media. Although the FTX debacle has dealt a heavy blow to the global cryptocurrency industry, she says the specific impact on the Bahamas has been “overblown”: “This idea that FTX has left a gaping hole in our economy or the fabric of our society—it’s just not true.”\nIf any country is equipped to recover from a reputational setback of this kind, says Rees, it’s his own. To the extent that any nation can have a single worldview, Rees claims the Bahamas’ is one of relentless optimism. “The Bahamas is the Bahamas,” he says. “We were here yesterday, and we’ll be here tomorrow.”","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BITCOIN","FINANCE","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2023-01-11"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/cryptocurrency-money-laundering-chainalysis-report/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The crypto money-laundering market is tighter than at any time in the past decade, and the few big players are moving a “shocking” amount of currency. ","title":"Most Criminal Cryptocurrency Funnels Through Just 5 Exchanges","detailed_content":"FOR YEARS, THE cryptocurrency economy has been rife with black market sales, theft, ransomware, and money laundering—despite the strange fact that in that economy, practically every transaction is written into a blockchain’s permanent, unchangeable ledger. But new evidence suggests that years of advancements in blockchain tracing and crackdowns on that illicit underworld may be having an effect—if not reducing the overall volume of crime, then at least cutting down on the number of laundering outlets, leaving the crypto black market with fewer options to cash out its proceeds than it’s had in a decade.\nIn a portion of its annual crime report focused on money laundering that was published today, cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis points to a new consolidation in crypto criminal cash-out services over the past year. It counted just 915 of those services used in 2022, the fewest it’s seen since 2012 and the latest sign of a steady drop-off in the number of those services since 2018. Chainalysis says an even smaller number of exchanges now enable the money-laundering trade of cryptocurrency for actual dollars, euros, and yen: It found that just five cryptocurrency exchanges now handle nearly 68 percent of all black market cash-outs. \nIn fact, Chainalysis saw just 542 cryptocurrency deposit addresses receive more than half of the $6.3 billion in total illicit funds it tracked to those cash-out services in 2022, and just four addresses received $1.1 billion of those funds.\nThat intense narrowing of so-called “off-ramps” for crypto crime is a result of an ongoing government crackdown on crypto money laundering and a sign of additional enforcement on the way, says Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ director of research. “It’s shocking to see some of these deposit addresses moving more than a hundred million dollars in illicit funds and still operating when it’s something that’s extremely transparent and easy to see with blockchain analytics,” Grauer says. “So it does seem like a good chokepoint, where we can shut down and profile and—to some degree—eradicate this activity.”\nWhether the overall amount of crypto crime rose or fell in 2022, meanwhile, is far from clear: By some measures, Chainalysis’ data has shown that criminal use of cryptocurrency increased last year despite the steep decline in cryptocurrency exchange rates. But those numbers include a huge spike in illegal transactions at sanctioned cryptocurrency exchanges—which may have less to do with a rise in crime than with the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) increasingly imposing those sanctions on major players in the crypto underground. In April of last year, for instance, OFAC sanctioned Garantex, an exchange based in Russia that it says laundered over $100 million in criminal proceeds, including ransomware payments. The year before, it sanctioned two other Russian exchanges, Chatex and Suex, which have since gone out of business. And just last week, OFAC sanctioned another exchange, Bitzlato, and the Justice Department indicted its Russian founder, Anatoly Legkodymov, and tore his operation offline.\n“You don’t carry out a ransomware attack if there’s no way of converting that ransom into something usable,” says Grauer. “What we’re really seeing OFAC doing, and what we’ve really highlighted, is that the money-laundering off-ramps are what’s facilitating crime. And I think the ongoing crackdown has shown that people understand they’re at a point where there can be meaningful intervention.”Chainalysis declined to name the five exchanges it says enabled the majority of cryptocurrency money laundering. That’s because, the company says, those exchanges may be the targets of ongoing investigations. (Chainalysis often works with law enforcement agencies in those investigations.) Further, the exchanges may not actually be aware that they’re enabling that money laundering, since money launderers often take pains to hide the source of their funds before it hits an exchange.\nIn fact, Chainalysis found that a large chunk of the illicit cash-outs went through two types of intermediaries that might obfuscate criminal funds: Many were traded through “nested services,” essentially exchanges that appear to be independent but actually use a larger exchange to carry out their trades. In those cases, the nested service, rather than the underlying exchange, is often responsible for complying with “know-your-customer” requirements, even as the larger exchange provides the cash reserves for transactions. \nIn another growing subset of cases, Chainalysis says, criminals are turning to individual dark-web-based money-laundering services, many of which offer to hide the origin of funds by combining them with other users’ transactions in a “mixer.” As law enforcement has cracked down on major mixing services in recent years—seizing and tearing offline the mixers Bitcoin Fog and Helix and sanctioning the mixing service Tornado Cash, for instance—more criminals have turned to smaller dark-web services that Chainalysis’ Grauer refers to as “mom-and-pop” mixers, whose distributed nature makes them harder to seize or disrupt.\nDespite its reluctance to name the top five money-laundering exchanges in its most recent report, in another report in February of last year Chainalysis did point to a collection of Russia-based exchanges it says have cashed out large sums of criminal proceeds. While some of the exchanges named in that report have since been sanctioned or gone offline, others—including Cashbank and TETChange—appear to still be active.\nWhen WIRED reached out to the US Treasury, an official there declined to comment on any specific exchanges or ongoing investigations. The official, who asked to remain unnamed due to the sensitive nature of sanctions policies that are coordinated between multiple government agencies, also suggested that Chainalysis’ data offered only one incomplete perspective on the crypto money-laundering landscape and that much of the consolidation it describes might simply be due to 2022’s crypto crash and the resulting bankruptcy of several exchanges—particularly more “fly-by-night” ones with looser compliance rules.\nBut the official also pointed to the Treasury’s own enforcement efforts—along with those of international partners—as an ongoing crackdown that has intentionally reduced options for criminals. “The way you get at money laundering on a broad scale is you slowly whittle down the number of open vulnerabilities. Little by little you make the gaps fewer and fewer, smaller and smaller,” the official says. “If you close up more gaps in the dam, more water flows through those open holes.”\nAs gradual as that process may be, Chainalysis’ Grauer says it’s a sign that efforts to trace and disrupt the crypto criminal world’s ATMs are slowly but surely having their intended effect. “We’ve worked to show where the money-laundering gaps are. There are gaps that remain,” says Grauer. “The crackdown is in progress.”","tags":["","BITCOIN","DARK WEB","CRYPTOCURRENCY","RANSOMWARE","CRIME"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2023-01-26"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/makerdao-rune-christensen-decentralize/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"One of the world’s biggest crypto groups just voted to back its enigmatic founder.

And now that it\u0027s happened, the move by a Manhattan grand jury is deepening fissures in America\u0027s already-fraught political divide. But while Trump headlines flood your feeds, there were plenty of other big stories this week, none of which have anything to do with any of that. \nIn Germany, police are cracking down on people who post adult content to websites and platforms that lack age-verification checks, like Twitter. This has resulted in fines and threats of jail time, while some performers are deleting their accounts—or fleeing the country. This is just one of the impacts of a wave of age-verification laws sweeping the global internet.\nMeanwhile, in darker corners of the internet, North Korea–backed hackers are using a rare technique to launder their stolen cryptocurrencies: paying to mine clean crypto with loot taken from their victims. The tactic is meant to throw blockchain detectives off the trail of swiped funds. Speaking of ill-gotten gains, Costa Rica is still reeling from a series of ransomware attacks last spring that left swaths of the country\u0027s infrastructure devastated.

But documents leaked by a whistleblower inside a Russian intelligence contractor seem to reveal some new and alarming pages of the Kremlin’s hybrid war playbook.\nA consortium of investigative journalists at 11 news outlets including Paper Trail Media, The Guardian, and The Washington Post obtained a leak of secret documents from a Russian cybersecurity contractor firm called Vulkan, the Russian word for volcano. The documents, which were also analyzed by cybersecurity firm Mandiant, reveal that Vulkan sold software tools to Russian intelligence agencies like the KGB-successor FSB and the GRU military intelligence agency, including its notorious cyberattack-focused team known as Sandworm. The tools include one piece of software for scanning the internet for security vulnerabilities and another that seemed designed to organize disinformation campaigns and coordinate offensive hacking operations. Perhaps most disturbing of all was a proposal for a third tool that appeared to be designed to allow hackers to train in simulated networks of infrastructure systems like railways and pipelines, with specific references to methods to sabotage those systems with catastrophic effects. But it’s not clear whether that last tool was ever built, and if so, whether it was used primarily for offensive hacking or “red team” defensive training, or whether it led to the development of any actual hacking capabilities targeting critical infrastructure.\nMajor Supply Chain Attack Targets Users of 3CX for Mac and Windows\nSecurity experts say North Korea–linked hackers have successfully carried out a supply chain attack through compromised versions of 3CX, a video and voice communications platform used by high-profile companies including American Express and Mercedes-Benz. 3CX says it has more than 600,000 customers. The hackers were able to install malware within the Mac and Windows versions of 3CX, which were signed with the company\u0027s keys, thus allowing the Trojanized apps to go undetected. The attack is being compared to Russian hackers\u0027 SolarWinds supply chain attack, which wrought havoc around the world for months. \nExecutive Order Bans US Agencies From Buying Commercial Spyware\nAs hacker-for-hire firms\u0027 tools proliferate to governments around the world, the Biden administration has made clear: The US will not be one of that industry\u0027s customers. A new executive order bans US agencies from buying access to that commercial spyware, a key step in a growing effort to curb companies like NSO Group, Cytrox, and Candiru, which have enabled surveillance and human rights abuses from Spain to Mexico to Saudi Arabia. US agencies haven\u0027t been confirmed to be past customers of any of those companies, though the FBI did at one point test NSO\u0027s Phantom spyware before ultimately walking away from a deal with the company. But the order nonetheless sets a precedent for governments worldwide, assuring that US taxpayer funds won\u0027t flow to a dangerous industry whose tools have offered intrusive hacking techniques to repressive regimes targeting activists, journalists, and human rights defenders.\nExxon Critics Hacked by Indian Spy Firm\nWhile we\u0027re on the subject of dangerous hacker-for-hire firms targeting vulnerable activists: The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Indian hacker-for-hire firm BellTroX targeted climate change activists campaigning against Exxon, including Greenpeace, Public Citizen, 350.org, and the Rockefeller Family Fund. The firm was hired by Israeli private detective Aviram Azari, who has since pleaded guilty to hacking conspiracy charges. Exactly who hired Azari remains unclear, and Exxon denies having any connection to Azari or the hacking campaign. The hackers successfully accessed email accounts for Greenpeace, Public Citizen, and 350.org, but it\u0027s not yet clear whether they successfully penetrated the Rockefeller Family Fund, an organization created by Rockefeller heirs that has worked to combat the oil industry\u0027s efforts to lobby against climate change solutions.","tags":["","SECURITY ROUNDUP","CYBERSECURITY","HACKING","MALWARE"],"author":"BY ANDREW COUTS","creation_date":"2023-04-01"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/sinbad-crypto-mixer-north-korean-hackers/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The world’s most prolific crypto thieves have used Sinbad.io to launder tens of millions.

It doesn’t have to be this way.","title":"Billionaires Are A Security Threat","detailed_content":"ELON MUSK’S ACQUISITION of Twitter is particularly hard to swallow because every report of internal chaos reminds us that we may have sacrificed the most promising mode of online communication invented in decades by failing to identify it for what it was back when we had the chance. Musk’s purchase should never have been possible in the first place because Twitter should never have been an asset. It is “the public conversation layer of the internet,” as founder Jack Dorsey once put it, and consequently has functioned as the de facto center of our global alert system through the pandemic. It is astonishing that it is even still possible for one person to own this. It’s like owning email.\nIn the field of information security, there’s a kind of vulnerability known as the evil maid attack whereby an untrusted party gains physical access to important hardware, such as the housekeeping staff coming into your hotel room when you’ve left your laptop unattended, thereby compromising it. We have here a new analog, just as capable of wrecking systems and leaking data. Call it the “evil billionaire attack” if you’d like. The weapon is money, and more specifically, the likelihood that when the moment arrives you won’t have enough of it to make a difference. The call is coming from inside the house.  \nThe reason this strategy works is that most ideas of any consequence are owned by people with more money than you, and then whenever possible they string them together into a network with the specific intent of making the gravity inescapable. Founders and investors and excitable technology writers like myself frequently use the term “platform” to describe technical systems with granular components that can be used to compose new functionality, and the power sources propelling the technology industry find platforms particularly appealing when the bits can be monetized each time they are used.\nSUBSCRIBE\nSubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\nA platform is better than an app, or so the theory goes, because you can use a platform to build multiple apps, or enable other developers and companies to build apps from which you might take a 30 percent cut. Whatever its advantages, the Twitter debacle should spell the end of the proprietary platform as a serious technical undertaking, a high profile illustration that they are too risky to trust no matter how strong the code might be. The overly conservative approach to intellectual property that makes things proprietary in the first place is also a liability that compromises everything a company might create because it empowers billionaires to kill them. Whether or not he actually destroys it, Musk’s takeover of Twitter is a case study in how to destroy something, a model for the next billionaire who fancies a social media empire. Our communication channel for the next vaccine we might need is now at risk.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nIt doesn’t have to be this way, because there is already another platform out there. You just have to know where to look.\nBlockchains fight this problem on the deepest level possible. It would be vastly more difficult, or perhaps impossible, for Musk to kill off a blockchain so long as a handful of users objected enough to continue operating independent nodes. Duplicating across many computers means the risk of losing access is infinitesimal; the blockchain is its own API. This comes with different complications, of course, but losing information outright due to a hostile party is not one of them. For example, when the Hic et Nunc marketplace for NFTs went under in late 2021, another version relaunched, putting a new wrapper around the same content. The blockchain acts as a shared resource that forces interoperability, almost like organic self-defense.\nOr consider the case of WordPress, the early blogging engine that has since grown into increasingly elaborate general-purpose content management software. It now powers about 40 percent of the open web, with which it is loosely synonymous. A huge economy has sprung up around it: companies that develop websites, developers who work for those companies, indie developers who work for themselves, many of them writing plugins which can be unlocked or extended with licensing fees. This is all possible because the core is open source and encourages the same of its ecosystem. WordPress has been around for a long time and its straightforward RSS feeds decisively lost out to Twitter’s social features, so in 2022 there is a reasonable argument that it is a bit long in the tooth. But we must now understand it to be a bigger technical success than Twitter, simply because it is not at risk.The rest of the web is even more bulletproof than WordPress because it is a suite of robust open protocols that can never be owned. Computers could not communicate at all without shared models, such as HTTP, FTP, and TCP/IP. The internet was built out of interoperability—even the parts we now think of as closed. There was a time not long ago when that was the whole point of building these things.\nInteroperability can be immediately rendered useless if half of the handshake is disappeared, so the next requirement is that you have to keep it all online. The brief chaotic saga of “left-pad” turned this into a high-profile lesson for developers. Most JavaScript code of any particular consequence makes its way to a code hosting service called npm, which makes it available for other developers to import and reuse. In 2016, an engineer who grew angry at the company behind the npm service protested by removing one of his projects, a simple function for manipulating text, which had a ripple effect across the software engineering industry as all the code that depended on it failed, and then the code that depended on that code failed, and so on. It was a hilarious mess, enough to prompt npm to change its policies. Now a software package published on npm can never be removed.\nPerhaps npm itself could go away entirely, though. By about 2019, this began to seem increasingly plausible as the company struggled to secure funding. We were teetering on the edge of a catastrophe there—the entire web development industry, from small WordPress shops to large multinational firms, had come to treat as fundamental infrastructure a startup that was not yet on stable financial footing. Companies with the resources to do so began archiving a backup copy of every package that was installed, as a hedge against the uncertain future facing npm. Even though the code was free and open source, access to it through the company running the hosting service was not assured.\nAnd then in early 2020, just as the pandemic was emerging, npm was suddenly acquired by Microsoft, and to all outward appearances has run smoothly ever since. (Somewhere out there an overworked npm employee just screamed into a pillow; my apologies.) This was a natural fit given that about two years earlier Microsoft had also purchased GitHub. \nWithin about five years of its launch, GitHub had become the single most important website in the history of software development. It is essentially a web-based interface wrapped around Git, a standalone tool for managing codebases that was first released in 2005 as a means to work on the Linux operating system, and has since grown to become the standard for nearly all modern software development. GitHub quite clearly loves open source code— it’s the bread and butter, the primary content displayed on the site, the most important thing it does for most everyone except its occasional enterprise customers—but Git itself, the beating heart, takes this dedication to the next level.One of the most revolutionary design decisions in Git is the concept of the “remote,” which refers to any copy of the code that exists elsewhere—in another folder on your computer, on a server, perhaps on GitHub. Or on a GitHub competitor, for that matter—GitLab is the most prominent alternative, and Keybase provides remotes to all its users; you can also tediously set up your own privately on most servers and computers. Among other things, Git mediates the interactions with remotes, and no remote is ever intrinsically privileged. As a result, a codebase stored in Git has no canonical location, so it can relocate freely in response to threats.\nI’ve been developing software with Git for many years, and it has shaped my thinking so deeply that at this point I could not live without it. Yet it still feels magical to send your code off to a new remote for the first time. With one command, you can copy years of work and gigabytes of code over to a new host, keeping nearly all the context, notes, information, mistakes, and jokes intact. It feels like you’ve hired professional movers to take all your stuff to your new home, which is a sensation I’ve rarely encountered in other technology products. Quite the opposite—the creator of WordPress recently reported that Twitter responded to user defections by explicitly switching off the ability to export user data via API on request. Thanks to the efforts of the insufferable free software nerds who build Linux, in the Git ecosystem the cost of switching is so low that it makes the success of GitHub even more remarkable. GitHub is best in class because it has to be. Its product is built atop a tech stack that dictates another company must be able to come along and eat its lunch. One might even argue that in the absence of this mechanic, the market can never really be free.\nEven after buying Twitter and dropping down the list of the wealthiest people in the world, Musk still has enough money to cover the valuations of npm, GitHub, GitLab, and Keybase combined, and could buy them and kill them off. He could not kill off the codebases they contain, though, since every project could just migrate to a new remote. Git was explicitly engineered to remain outside the reach of bad actors no matter how much money they have, and to propagate that powerful property into all the code it touches. It’s not just that Git is free and open. It was designed in a way that means it can never be anything else. At this point the only way to stop it would be to build an even better replacement. Good luck!\nIf you were to build your replacement using Git as a starting point, you’d still have a problem. That’s because Git is licensed under the GNU General Public License, a particularly aggressive license used by open source software projects, which dictates that all downstream work must be shared openly under the same license. Since the source code for Git is itself open source, anyone can extend it and create derivatives, but it’s illegal for that work to be treated as proprietary intellectual property. This property has a ripple effect: Free open source software released under this license tends to create more free open source software released under this license.These success stories are wonderful, but they all pale in comparison to Wikipedia, the greatest work of human knowledge of all time and the single most important thing ever created on the web. It was routinely mocked as absurd in its earliest days, but it is by now deeply woven into our lives—it lives in your pocket all the time, and you can pull it out at a bar and talk about an article with your friend or date. We take it for granted. Its value cannot be quantified. Somehow, it is also free.\nSo in medicine, finance, and art, we should be trying to create a spiritual equivalent of Wikipedia that does whatever the discipline requires. Math, cooking, memories of dead loved ones. Computers too, possibly? GitHub doesn’t count, but Git might. The “sharing economy,” now an entire layer of professional existence across every conceivable dimension, emerged from a glut of startups emulating rideshare companies: Uber for this, Uber for that. It became a punchline. Enough. Grow up. Nobody cares. Go make a Wikipedia for something instead.\nOpen source software has always been propelled by the vague notion that it will improve the commons, that the implicit or higher-order collaboration resulting from showing and sharing your work leads to better projects, successful companies, more ambitious ideas, greater futures. If we all stand on the shoulders of giants, then some of us will find things up there. And sure, fine – that’s a utopian vision we could all use a bit more of, especially after recent events. Dorsey’s reflections on Twitter’s turmoil last week concluded, “We did the right thing for the public company business at the time, but the wrong thing for the internet and society.” There’s a tension to resolve there, sure. But I am also going to take it a step further: In a world peppered with bored billionaires, lack of open access becomes an existential risk that could suddenly wipe it all out.\nFor decades now, technology has measured achievement in things like funding rounds, company valuations, potential market, active users, downloads, and yes, stock prices. But these are all units of capitalism. One level deeper, should you choose to further interrogate it, the platform for the platform is just money. Who cares? We already know how this one goes.\nCapital can kill code. Capital can kill anything. So if what you have created is important, then so long as billionaires still exist, you are going to need to turn it into something that can’t be bought. An idea that can’t be killed is more valuable than an idea that can be killed, and the only thing that billions of dollars cannot kill is something that cannot have a price tag to begin with, because it exists in abundance, endlessly replicating as it spreads across the world.\nThe good news is that the better, stronger, more resilient world we need is inevitable given enough time, because the foundation has been laid. Twitter may not ultimately crumble, and even if it does, ActivityPub, Bluesky, Mastodon, and good old RSS feeds are all waiting to pick up the slack. Brilliant people will create amazing things in JavaScript, save them to GitLab remotes, and publish them on npm. Some of them have already started. These are the reasons why even the worst case scenario for Twitter under Musk would not be a complete disaster for the world’s communication. We will be okay because all these pieces are already out there. We will be okay because the mistakes we made in treating Twitter as a platform were not made the last time around with an earlier generation of technologies, the ones with which Twitter was built, the ones we should strive to emulate again. We will be okay specifically because we still have the web. ❤️","tags":["","PROGRAMMING","OPEN SOURCE","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","SOFTWARE","APIS","DEVELOPERS","COMMUNITIES","GITHUB"],"author":"BY VIJITH ASSAR","creation_date":"2022-12-20"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/death-technology-memory/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"These past few years have been visceral reminders of our mortality.

For instance, in 2020, hologram experts Kaleida collaborated with Kanye West to create a hologram of Kim Kardashian’s late father for her 40th birthday. Genealogy platform MyHeritage has created Deep Nostalgia, a deep-fake tool that animates the faces of departed relatives in family photos.

Immersive virtual reality combined with multisensory stimulation will also allow us to interact with the image of our lost loved ones in an emotionally visceral way. We’ve already seen such technology used in the entertainment industry, with premium cinema startup Positron creating a range of Voyager VR chairs that amplify cinematic experiences with haptic pillows and scent dispensers. Reimagined for memorial purposes, this tech will allow us to not just see the image of the deceased, but also smell their signature perfume and physically feel their presence on our skin.\nIn 2023, technology will also be used to not only preserve our conversations with those who have passed on, but also replicate them. This will be possible with tools such as the hyperrealistic online chatbot Project December, which uses AI to emulate the style of whatever text is fed to it. Through learning from the remnants of their digital trails—text messages, blog posts, 3 am tweets—AI will let us talk with a chatbot that mimics someone no longer with us.\nAs these technologies develop and become more accessible, they will increasingly be used in combination, creating “intelligent avatars” of ourselves that continue to “live” long after we have died. We are seeing the beginnings of this with the metaverse company Somnium Space, whose Live Forever mode allows users to create “digital clones” built from data they have stored while alive, including conversational style, gaits, and even facial expressions. \nThis sense of immortality may be reassuring, but there is a catch. AI avatars will rely on us feeding their algorithms a huge amount of personal data, accumulated through the course of our lives. If we want our digital selves to live on, this is the exchange we must accept: that the unfiltered beliefs and opinions we express today may not only be archived, but consequently used to build these posthumous personae. In other words, we can have a voice in the afterlife, but we cannot be certain about what it may say. This will force us to reconsider how our behaviors today might influence digital versions of ourselves set to outlive us. Faced with this prospect of virtual immortality, 2023 will be the year we broaden our definition of what it means to live forever, a moral question that will fundamentally change how we live our day-to-day lives, but also what it means to be immortal.","tags":["","VIRTUAL REALITY","AUGMENTED REALITY","THE WIRED WORLD IN 2023","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","DEATH","MEMORY"],"author":"BY RANKIN","creation_date":"2022-12-15"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/us-congress-ftx-cryptocurrency-regulation/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Think Washington lawmakers have what it takes to tackle the volatile world of cryptocurrencies?

Many companies opted to continue virtually attending the annual consumer trade show. Even though CES 2023 is not expected to recapture the entire grandeur of years past, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) that hosts the event anticipates around 100,000 attendees.\nCES 2023 runs from January 5 to 8, and it still offers an option for remote attendance. In spite of an economy that’s worrisome for most CEOs and last year’s major flops (remember NFTs?), innovative hardware announcements will continue to make a splash on the showroom floor. From cohesive developments in the smart home category to peculiar designs for electric vehicles, here’s what you can expect at CES 2023.\nMore CES Coverage\nCES Liveblog\n9 Neat Things We\u0027ve Seen So Far\n9 More Cool Things from CES 2023\nGadget Lab Podcast: CES 2023\nWIRED\u0027s Best of CES 2023\nInteroperability That Matters\nWhat if every aspect of your smart home actually worked together, even if the products were made by different companies? Matter, a new protocol from the Connectivity Standards Alliance, enables seamless interoperability between smart home devices from Apple, Amazon, Google, Samsung, and other manufacturers. Previous fragmentation held back the overall smart home experience, especially for consumers who wanted to mix and match gadgets. “The great promise of the smart home, literally since its inception, is that all the connected gadgets would work seamlessly together,” WIRED senior editor Michael Calore tells me. “That hasn’t been the case at all, so Matter feels like the next big step toward that promised interoperability.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\nChess Pro Answers Questions From Twitter\nLaunched last year in November, almost 300 products are already Matter-certified, with more announcements expected at CES 2023. “Matter makes smart home devices easier to buy for consumers as they can now choose the products that best fit their needs, regardless of what ecosystem, smartphone, app, or voice assistant they have,” writes Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, over email. Lights, locks, and thermostats are a few of the categories currently supported. The company is working to extend compatibility for additional smart home devices like cameras, appliances, and smoke detectors.\nIts unique approach to smart home security uses blockchain technology. Richardson writes, “Matter also raises the bar for security, using blockchain to validate and store credentials on the home network, encrypting messages (commands) between devices, enabling local control (no cloud), and including a pathway to easy security updates.” Safety experts point out cloud control as a major weakness when it comes to securing the data collected by your smart home.\nThe Metaverse Sobers Up\nAt last year’s CES, plans for a utopian metaverse where consumers would live, work, and play like never before were a primary focus. While not completely scrapped, the unquestioned excitement for the concept has dissipated due to billions of dollars lost, slow consumer adoption, and turbulent macroeconomic factors.\nAlthough the tenor of discussions is subdued, you can expect hardware innovations to continue for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu anticipates a potential breakthrough moment for smart glasses as they become less cumbersome: “That\u0027s been one of the biggest barriers to the category, and I think we can expect some companies to showcase some strides in making components smaller and lighter, so that AR glasses don’t have to be thick, ugly, and heavy.”\nMighty Morphin’ Electric Vehicles \nDuring CES 2023, you can bank on seeing plenty of electric vehicles that don’t match the aesthetics of a typical car. “Since EVs don’t have gas tanks or traditional drivetrains, and since their battery packs can be shaped flat, the interior flooring doesn’t have all the bumps or humps that we’ve been dealing with for decades,” writes Calore. “That frees up the designers to think about the interior in new ways, from seating configurations to entertainment systems.” Although the more outlandish ideas will not be available anytime soon at your local dealer, the concept cars provide a small peek into what might be on the road five or 10 years in the future.\nA Saturation of Sustainability\nWhether it’s smartphone cases created from recycled materials or TV remotes that don’t need batteries, companies will continue to rethink their manufacturing process to placate a growing consumer demand for sustainable goods. “I’m seeing more and more companies highlight how a product is made and whether it uses recycled or sustainable materials, which seems to be the trajectory where everyone is heading,” writes Chokkattu.\nSustainability trends may even impact your at-home spa nights! Decadent bubble baths are out. Decadent (albeit short) showers are in. “My one weird observation is that when the pandemic started, everyone was really talking about baths, like Kohler’s ultra-luxurious Stillness Bath. Now, people are more concerned about sustainability and water usage, which means that I’m seeing a lot of ultra-luxurious, uh, showers,” shares WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So. “I’m going to go ahead and say that luxury showering is going to be a trend in 2023. Installing a low-flow showerhead that heats the air around it is good. Just don’t stay in the shower for 40 minutes.”\nGadgetry Galore\nOf course, CES this year will include a flurry of new product announcements, from a wireless TV that uses vacuum suction to stick on the wall to gaming laptops that are just a wee bit bigger. Chokkattu anticipates further developments for smartphone cameras, with improved data collection for applications like skin condition detection. \nSo still expects companies to launch health tracking devices specifically made for “fertile, pregnant, or immediately postpartum people,” despite the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She also foresees an impending proliferation of satellite messengers that are affordable and easy to use for anyone who wants to stay safe when they’re off the grid.\nMichael Calore, Julian Chokkattu, and Adrienne So contributed to this report.","tags":["","CES","CONSUMER TECH","SMART HOME","METAVERSE","ELECTRIC VEHICLES","SUSTAINABILITY"],"author":"BY REECE ROGERS","creation_date":"2023-01-03"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-hack-theft-crypto-tracing/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Mysterious crooks took hundreds of millions of dollars from FTX just as it collapsed. Crypto-tracing blockchain analysis may provide an answer.","title":"The Hunt for the FTX Thieves Has Begun","detailed_content":"UPDATED BELOW WITH new findings that some portion of the money may have been seized by government authorities in the Bahamas.\nCryptocurrency has always offered a strange mix of temptations and challenges for anyone trying to steal it. As digital cash, held in multibillion-dollar sums on hackable, internet-connected networks, it presents a lucrative target. But once it\u0027s stolen, the blockchains that almost every cryptocurrency is built on make it possible to follow that money\u0027s every movement and, very often, to identify the thieves. So after a massive sum of nearly half a billion dollars worth of funds was pulled out of the already collapsing FTX cryptocurrency exchange yesterday, the world\u0027s crypto tracers are now closely tracking where that loot ends up—and looking for any clues that reveal the culprit to be an FTX insider or just an opportunistic hacker.\nOn Friday, hours after the major cryptocurrency exchange FTX had filed for bankruptcy in the wake of its epic, 10-figure collapse, FTX\u0027s remaining funds were drained of more than $663 million worth of cryptocurrency, much of which appears to have been stolen. \"FTX has been hacked,\" wrote an administrator in FTX\u0027s Telegram channel. \"FTX apps are malware. Delete them.\" Exactly how FTX might have been breached—and whether its apps are, in fact, compromised—is far from clear, and FTX hasn\u0027t officially announced any theft. But the company\u0027s US general counsel wrote in a tweet that \"unauthorized access to certain assets has occurred.\" (FTX did not respond to WIRED\u0027s request for comment.)\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nSoon, the crypto-tracing and blockchain analysis firm Elliptic revealed that the $663 million outflow seemed to be a combination of FTX\u0027s movement of coins into its own storage wallets and a mysterious theft. According to Elliptic, fully $477 million of the funds appear to have been stolen, though another crypto-tracing firm, TRM Labs, puts the number at $338 million. Twenty-four hours after the apparent heist, most of that money had moved into just a handful of cryptocurrency addresses—where the entire crypto-tracing industry, a vast community of amateur crypto sleuths, and no doubt law enforcement agencies around the globe are now all watching it with an unblinking gaze.\nThat observability, for the FTX funds and for other stashes of stolen crypto, presents a serious challenge for any thief trying to cash out their haul into traditional currency. In this case, where regulators and an army of aggrieved creditors are looking for any sign that FTX\u0027s staff or owners may themselves be the culprits, it could ultimately help confirm that insiders were responsible for the theft—or instead show that external hackers took advantage of the chaos at FTX to pull off a burglary.\n\"We’re definitely watching the movements of these funds,\" says Chris Janczewski, the head of investigations at TRM Labs and a former special agent at the IRS\u0027s criminal investigations division. \"This potential thief has hundreds of millions of dollars. But it\u0027s like they went into a bank, took as much cash as they could carry, and then the dye packs went off. They\u0027ve got all this money, but now everyone knows it\u0027s connected to this bank robbery. What can you actually do with it?\"According to Elliptic\u0027s analysis, at least $220 million of funds stolen in the form of a variety of cryptocurrencies were quickly traded through decentralized exchanges—trading platforms that allow users to swap coins without giving identifying information—to convert them into the cryptocurrencies ether and dai. But cashing out those coins and the rest of the stolen loot will likely require trading it on a centralized exchange, which almost always requires users to hand over identifying information. The thieves may try to put the money through a \"mixing\" service that launders the coins by blending them with those of other users. But crypto-tracing blockchain analysts have proven they can often defeat those mixers—particularly when users are feeding very large sums into them. And some mixers, like the Tornado Cash service that was sanctioned by the US Treasury in August, render cryptocurrency untouchable for many exchanges or vulnerable to seizure.\nElliptic co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson later updated Elliptic\u0027s findings to point out that the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, where FTX is based, now say they seized some part of the FTX funds, which may be yet another explanation of the money\u0027s movement: Perhaps someone within FTX\u0027s staff moved the money into a government account by order of those Bahamian authorities. But Robinson notes that hardly explains the movement of millions of dollars worth of funds through decentralized exchanges, which isn\u0027t the typical behavior of a government regulator handling seized money. \"It could be that one or multiple accounts are under the control of the Bahamas authorities, but others aren’t,\" says Robinson.\nIf FTX was emptied out by actual thieves or insider embezzlers, they\u0027ll find it hard to abscond with their profits in a spendable form without being identified, says Michelle Lai, a cryptocurrency privacy advocate, investor, and consultant who says she\u0027s been tracking the movements of the FTX funds with \"morbid fascination.\" But the real question, Lai says, is whether identifying those thieves would offer any recourse: After all, many of the most prolific cryptocurrency thieves are Russians or North Koreans operating in non-extradition countries, beyond the reach of Western law enforcement. \"It\u0027s not a question of whether they\u0027ll know who did it. It\u0027s whether it will be actionable,\" says Lai. \"Whether they\u0027re onshore.\"\nIn the meantime, Lai and many other crypto-watchers have been closely eyeing one Ethereum address on the blockchain-tracking site Etherscan that is currently holding around $192 million worth of the funds. The account has been sending small sums of Ethereum-based tokens—some of which appear to have little to no value—to a variety of exchange accounts, as well as Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin and Ukrainian cryptocurrency fundraiser accounts. But Lai guesses that these transactions are likely meant to simply complicate the picture for law enforcement or other observers before any real attempt to launder or cash out the money. And Elliptic\u0027s Tom Robinson says those transactions appear to be the work of hoaxer who have created their own fake cryptocurrency tokens to manipulate Etherscan, rather than actual payments made by the holder of FTX\u0027s wayward funds.More tellingly, Tobias Silver, founder of crypto service Just.Money, pointed out on Twitter that one of the thieves\u0027 transactions appeared to have been paid for with transaction fees funded from an account on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, which is likely required to possess identifying information for that account under \"know-your-customer\" laws. Kraken\u0027s chief security officer, Nicholas Percoco, later tweeted, \"We know the identity of the user.\" When WIRED reached out to Percoco for comment, a Kraken spokesperson responded in a statement that \"we have actively monitored recent developments with the FTX estate, are in contact with law enforcement, and have frozen Kraken account access to certain funds we suspect to be associated with \u0027fraud, negligence or misconduct\u0027 related to FTX (as set forth in our Terms of Service).”\nThe looting or seizure of FTX\u0027s holdings—whether it totals to $338 million or $477 million—hardly represents an unprecedented haul in the world of cryptocurrency crime. In the late-March hack of the Ronin bridge, a gaming cryptocurrency exchange, North Korean thieves took $540 million. And earlier this year, cryptocurrency tracing led to the bust of a New York couple accused of laundering $4.5 billion in crypto.\nBut in the case of the high-profile FTX theft and the exchange\u0027s overall collapse, tracing the errant funds might help put to rest—or confirm—swirling suspicions that someone within FTX was responsible for the theft. The company\u0027s Bahamas-based CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who resigned Friday, lost virtually his entire $16 billion fortune in the collapse. According to an unconfirmed report from CoinTelegraph, he and two other FTX executives are “under supervision” in the Bahamas, preventing them from leaving the country. Reuters also reported late last week that Bankman-Fried possessed a \"back door\" that was built into FTX\u0027s compliance system, allowing him to withdraw funds without alerting others at the company.\nDespite those suspicions, TRM Labs\u0027 Janczewski points out that the chaos of FTX\u0027s meltdown might have provided an opportunity for hackers to exploit panicked employees and trick them into, say, clicking on a phishing email. Or, as Michelle Lai notes, bankrupted insider employees might have collaborated with hackers as a means to recover some of their own lost assets.\nAs the questions mount over whether—or to what degree—FTX\u0027s own management might be responsible for the missing funds, the case has begun to resemble, more than any recent crypto heist, a very old one: the theft of a half billion dollars worth of bitcoins, discovered in 2014, from Mt. Gox, the first cryptocurrency exchange. In that case, blockchain analysis carried out by cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis, along with law enforcement, helped to pin the theft on external hackers rather than Mt. Gox\u0027s own staff. Eventually, Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man, was arrested in Greece in 2017 and later convicted of laundering the stolen Mt. Gox funds, exonerating Mt. Gox\u0027s embattled executives.\nWhether history will repeat itself, and cryptocurrency tracing will prove the innocence of FTX\u0027s staff, remains far from clear. But as more eyes than ever scour the cryptocurrency economy\u0027s blockchains, it\u0027s a surer bet that the whodunit behind the FTX theft will, sooner or later, produce an answer.\nUpdate 8:40 am 11-14-22: Added details about links from one of the thieves\u0027 transactions to the Kraken exchange, which may have revealed their identity.\nUpdate 12:30 pm 11-14-22: Added a response from Kraken.\nUpdated 12:15 pm 11-18-22: Added new findings that some of the money appears to have been seized by the Bahamas Securities Commission.","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","HACKING","FINANCE","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2022-11-13"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/oneplus-pad-android-tablet/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Plus: Netflix expands its efforts to end password sharing, Apple’s “buy now, pay later” entry creeps closer, and we scrutinize your Bitcoin spending.","title":"OnePlus Now Has Its Own Android Tablet","detailed_content":"THERE’S NO SHORTAGE of tablets in the world, from the ever-dominant iPad to an assortment of Android options and Fire tabs to the niche weirdos like the E-ink and stylus Kindle Scribe. Now, OnePlus, a Chinese manufacturer known for its speedy, solid smartphones, is throwing its own Android tablet onto the table. The company announced the OnePlus Pad this week, along with the second generation of its Buds Pro bluetooth earbuds, and an all new mechanical keyboard.\nThe aluminum-bodied tablet looks to be a sleek addition to the often clunky world of Android tablets. Most notable is its 11.6-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 7:5. That’s odd for a tablet; most iPad screens are 4:3, which is the same as a classic television set. When you hold the OnePlus Pad in landscape mode, the tablet’s screen should be a little taller than you might be used to on a tablet. \nThere\u0027s a 13-megapixel camera on the back of the tablet (and an 8-megapixel selfie cam on the front).\nPHOTOGRAPH: ONEPLUS\nAlso notable is the matching keyboard that attaches magnetically, and the stylus for pen input. Both are sold separately. OnePlus claims the battery life is good for over 12 hours of continuous video playback; you can watch Seven Samurai three times plus a couple episodes of The Office before recharging. It is available in one color (green) and will be available for preorder in April for an undetermined price. Hovering ominously in the background here is the notion that Google is expected to debut its newest Android tablet later this year, possibly in May.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow Vinyl Records Are Made (with Third Man Records)\nHere are some other stories from the world of consumer tech.\nNotflix\nLast week, Netflix accidentally leaked the news that it will crack down on password sharing. Then it hastily walked that back after a public outcry. But now Netflix has officially announced it is implementing rules that prevent people who don’t live in the same home from sharing a single Netflix account. The unlucky first victims of this policy are subscribers in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal.\nIn its announcement, Netflix detailed its plans for limiting account sharing. Now, anyone not living in the same household as the account holder will be prompted to transfer their profiles to a new paid account or be cut off. Netflix says the restrictions will roll out more broadly within months. It also said the service would “refine these new features based on member feedback.” As you might imagine, that feedback has been not great.\nThe streaming service has been building to this for a while now, testing out these restrictions in countries with a smaller customer base. The crackdown hasn’t come for the US yet, but that it will seems about as likely as Netflix canceling one of its shows after a single season. (Which is to say, very likely.)\nApple Tests Buy Now, Pay Later\nBuy-now, pay-later plans are all the rage, allowing customers to pay for stuff in interest-free installments rather than one bank-breaking chunk. Financial services like Klarna and Affirm have become very popular among cash-strapped consumers, who have even used them to buy food and holiday gifts. Of course, they’ve got some problems. (Who doesn’t love the idea of not paying full price and then potentially getting wracked by debt months later?)\nApple is eager to get in on the BNPL game under its own proprietary system, of course. Apple first announced the feature at its 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference, but it has yet to make its way to the public. Recently, Apple expanded its testing of the plan to employees at its retail stores, a move that has often preceded other Apple service announcements. That seems to indicate that the broader rollout of its BNPL plan is imminent.\nThe Crypto Keeper\nBack in the day, all the cool kid criminals used crypto. Blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin were hailed as an anonymous, untraceable means of payment. Aspiring lawbreakers could use crypto to buy even the darkest of dark web contraband with impunity, their identities shrouded in the mystery guaranteed by their means of payment. Or so many people thought.\nTurns out, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in fact entirely traceable. You just have to know where to look. And unfortunately for some crypto-carrying criminals, federal law enforcement officers knew exactly how to track them down.This week on Gadget Lab, WIRED senior writer and author of the book Tracers in the Dark Andy Greenberg digs into the cat-and-mouse game that is uncovering crypto cybercrime, and why even the people who depended on the complexity of crypto the most failed to understand the digital trail that it leaves behind.","tags":["","GEAR ROUNDUP","TABLETS","ANDROID TABLETS","NETFLIX"],"author":"BY BOONE ASHWORTH","creation_date":"2023-02-11"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-fallout-of-the-ftx-collapse/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"As Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire crumbles, its customers, and other crypto traders, are paying the price.","title":"The Fallout of the FTX Collapse","detailed_content":"WHEN SAMUEL REALIZED that FTX had suspended withdrawals on November 8, his hands began to tremble. The $25,000 in assets he keeps with the crypto exchange, equivalent to a decade’s worth of savings, was suddenly out of his reach.\nSamuel, who asked to be referred to only by first name to preserve his anonymity, says he lives somewhere in Southeast Asia and is currently between jobs, which means money is tight. The cryptocurrency in his FTX account was his nest egg.\nSamuel first caught wind of a problem at FTX on November 6, but dismissed the reports as simple “FUD”—a term used in crypto circles to describe baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt. He says he thought that FTX, until now one of the world’s most reputable exchanges, was “bulletproof” and there was no way his funds could be in danger. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried helped contribute to this misconception, tweeting on November 7 that “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.” (The tweet has now been deleted.)\nFEATURED VIDEO\n This week, it became clear that FTX was on the brink of collapse. Today it voluntarily started bankruptcy proceedings in the US, joining the ranks of Mt. Gox, Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, and others in the crypto hall of shame. The troubled exchange was briefly handed a lifeline on Tuesday when Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance (who goes by the name CZ), announced on Twitter that a rescue deal had been reached. But less than 48 hours later, Binance backed out, citing the results of corporate due diligence and news reports of mishandling of customer funds at FTX.\nSamuel’s portfolio is made up predominantly of a cryptocurrency called XRP, the price of which is thought to have been depressed by an ongoing lawsuit between its issuer, Ripple Labs, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Recently, there have been signs the two-year legal battle may be coming to a close—and Samuel had been sitting tight in the hope that a favorable ruling might send the price of XRP skyward. But now, with his tokens locked up in FTX, he won’t be able to reap the rewards for his patience. “I could see the finish line, but this latest drama has me hanged by the balls,” he says. “It’s just so much hardship.”\nThere are many FTX customers with stories like this one. One FTX trader, who asked to remain anonymous, was in the US when they first heard of trouble at the exchange, which meant it was not possible to immediately withdraw their funds (FTX International, not to be confused with FTX US, is unavailable in the country.) When the FTX trader eventually used a VPN service to bypass the geo-restrictions, they found their withdrawal password needed to be reset, a process that for security reasons prevents money from being taken out of an account for 24 hours. By that time, it was already too late.\nThe FTX trader has the equivalent of $350,000 locked up in FTX, which they say amounts to 97 percent of their liquid net worth and represents 15 years’ worth of savings and investment gains. Unable to access the funds, they are now “in a highly vulnerable position due to debt and other liabilities that I may now be unable to service.” The fall of FTX, they say, “has changed my previously conditional trust in centralized exchanges—no matter how large and reputable—into an unconditional distrust.”Aaron Kaplan, a securities attorney and co-CEO of trading platform Prometheum, says that although the final outcome for FTX and its customers is not yet crystal clear, there is precedent in scenarios such as this for people never to recover their funds. Unfortunately, those caught up in the collapse are left with little in the way of legal recourse, says Kaplan. “The facts will come out in time. What is clear at this present moment is that FTX was taking advantage of a gray area at the heart of which was the expectation of profit, irrespective of the best interest of customers.”\nIn a Twitter thread announcing the bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried implied he still hopes to help customers recover their funds. But thinking this unlikely, some FTX customers are attempting to flog their account balances at a steep discount. As reported by CoinDesk on November 9, buyers on messaging platform Telegram are bidding $0.10 to $0.15 cents on the dollar for funds tied up in FTX, gambling on the chance they may eventually be released.\nThe financial impact of the collapse extends far beyond the immediate FTX customer base, too. The week’s events have sent other crypto coins into a downward spiral, with the price of both bitcoin and ether falling by more than 10 percent, wiping upward of $60 billion from the market. Large sums of SOL, the native token of the Solana network, are owned by FTX and its subsidiaries, and therefore has been hit even harder. Between November 7 and November 9, the value of SOL fell from $32 per coin to $13.\nA crypto trader who goes by the name Mando CT had at one point yesterday lost $637,000 on his SOL holdings and various Solana-based NFTs. (A slight recovery in the price of SOL, combined with other bets, has since helped him recoup some of these losses.) He says he remains confident in Solana’s core value proposition and quality of the technology, and has even purchased more SOL in an attempt to “buy the dip”, but concedes the fall of FTX will have “a huge impact on the whole market.”\nAlthough developers whose apps sit atop Solana claim it’s still the best network for building services at scale—the CEOs of both Audium and Irreverent Labs, two such development studios, say they are unconcerned about price of SOL—others predict the knock-on effects of the FTX crash will have a detrimental effect on the overall health of the ecosystem.\n“Developers in the blockchain space tend to put their efforts where the most money is located,” says Francesco Melpignano, CEO at Kadena Eco, which helps to incubate new projects tied to the Kadena blockchain. “If we see funds leaking away from Solana, developers will certainly be more incentivized to build elsewhere.”\nElsewhere, BlockFi says it was forced to cease operations, citing “a lack of clarity” over the situation at FTX. The crypto lender had itself been bailed out by FTX US earlier this year after it was caught up in the Three Arrows Capital collapse, but its future is now uncertain, illustrating the contagion effect described by CZ earlier today. “With FTX going down, we will see cascading effects,” he said. “Especially for those close to the FTX ecosystem.”\nIn the days since the crisis began, FTX’s Bankman-Fried, who is usually a prolific tweeter, has been uncharacteristically quiet. In a manic Twitter thread posted yesterday afternoon, he broke his silence: “I’m sorry,” he tweeted. “I fucked up, and should have done better.”\nThe FTX founder gave a puzzling explanation of the events that led up to the fall (something to do with “a poor labeling of bank-related accounts,” apparently) and set out a plan to do right by customers. “We’re spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity,” he wrote. “Every penny of that—and of the existing collateral—will go straight to users, unless or until we’ve done right by them.”\nAlthough it will be cold comfort to those whose funds are stranded in the exchange, Bankman-Fried has himself suffered extraordinary losses. Today, Bloomberg reported that his personal fortune, worth $16 billion just last week, has been wiped out entirely in the collapse of FTX—every single dollar—in what’s described as “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","FINANCE","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2022-11-11"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-had-a-plan-to-fix-social-media-bluesky-will-elon-musk-follow-it/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"For years, the platform has funded a project that\u0027s meant to create a better, decentralized online experience.

In a message to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey in March, Musk said he wanted to turn the platform into “something new that’s decentralized.” And in conversation with his brother Kimbal, he tossed around the idea of a social network “based on a blockchain,” before realizing it might be too complicated.\nInstead, he could turn to Bluesky, a project incubated inside Twitter that promises to establish a “federated social network” based around an open standard that multiple platforms can adopt.\nSince it was set up under Dorsey in 2019, Bluesky has tried to create a system that lets users see how algorithms serve up content and control their personal data, and allows them to use a single profile across several social apps. Dorsey, who bonded with Musk over a shared enthusiasm for crypto, effectively pitched him the idea of using Bluesky earlier this year when he proposed that Twitter be turned into “an open source protocol.” Musk’s response? “Super interesting idea.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nSo far, Bluesky has received at least $13 million in funding from Twitter, and Dorsey continues to be involved as a member of the board. There was precious little to show for this investment until only a few weeks ago, when Bluesky unveiled an “improved and simplified” version of its platform, called the AT Protocol, and technical documentation that showed developers how to build on top of the platform. It also set up a waitlist for its app, which will act as a browser for the network and enter private beta testing soon. Bluesky is now independent of Twitter—so as to best provide “public benefit”—but whether or not the dollars keep flowing will be up to Musk.\nJay Graber, Bluesky’s CEO, declined to comment on the progress of the project and the implications of Musk’s acquisition, but has implied publicly that she is unconcerned about the project’s future. “Very curious to see where Elon is going to take Twitter,” she tweeted. “Very glad we’re independent—will keep working on building protocols that make social more resilient to rapid change.” Meanwhile, in a thread published in April, soon after Musk tabled his bid, Bluesky claimed it will continue to receive funding from Twitter as long as it works toward enabling “open and decentralized public conversation”—a loose brief if ever there was one.\nWhat’s uncertain is how the federated social network, if it were adopted under Musk, will function in practice. If Musk chooses to follow Dorsey’s original vision, Twitter will become one of multiple social media services acting as a “client” for the Bluesky standard, but it’s unclear quite what this will mean for the end user. Bluesky hasn’t explained how the AT Protocol will change the way platforms are able to monetize and moderate content, saying only that it will create more interoperability and transparency around recommendation algorithms.Musk’s chief concern will be whether he can align his philosophical affection for decentralization with the need to turn Twitter into a profitable business. He has previously expressed a desire to open source the Twitter algorithm in the name of transparency, but ceding control of the algorithm (the mechanism by which people are kept on the platform) would be another step entirely, and surely a disaster for advertising revenue.\nMusk might use Bluesky technology to partly realize his ambition to turn Twitter into “X, the everything app”—a type of super-app that blends social media with payments and other utilities, similar to WeChat. Although the AT Protocol does not use blockchain, it is able to “integrate with cryptocurrencies,” Graber has previously said, which means Bluesky could help support the payments aspect of the vision. But again, this is all dealing in the hypothetical.\nAlthough plenty of questions hang over the implementation, Bluesky isn’t alone in thinking that society would benefit from a more decentralized social media ecosystem, with less power pooled in the hands of a cash-motivated minority.\nEvan Henshaw-Plath, the first employee of Odeo (which made Twitter), runs a “peer-to-peer social network” called Planetary that shares plenty of common ground with Bluesky; both are attempting to increase transparency around algorithms and give people control of their personal data.\nHenshaw-Plath predicts that Twitter will experiment heavily with Web3 and crypto-related projects under Musk, irrespective of whether Bluesky ends up playing a starring role. “I’m not sure that’s good,” he says, “but it’s definitely where most of the big changes will be.”\nHenshaw-Plath also says the acquisition might increase the chances of Bluesky securing additional funding since Twitter is no longer “constrained by Wall Street,” and suspects that Dorsey might return to Twitter in some capacity under Musk.\nOnce the AT Protocol is up and running, the aim is to enable a level of interaction between Planetary and Bluesky networks, says Henshaw-Plath, creating a sort of coalition motivated by the shared desire to tip the balance of power in favor of users.\nThis is also the ambition of Stani Kulechov, the creator of Lens Protocol, a similar project that relies on users self-hosting their profiles to create decentralization—an alternative to Bluesky’s cloud-based model. He says this approach “enables people to own their social capital” in terms of both their content and audience, and ensures social profiles are “always in your custody and control.”\nBut while efforts to minimize companies’ control over the way people communicate should be celebrated, there are short-term dangers that need to be taken into account, says Brewster Kahle, the creator of the Internet Archive, who was recently inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. “If decentralization brought local control to more people in how they build their communities, that would be a good thing,” says Kahle. But the concern is that a lack of clarity over the mechanics of moderation under this new model might lead to the kind of “free-for-all hellscape” Musk says he is determined to avoid. “In the short term, decentralization could mean there is no content moderation or spam controls at all, giving a louder megaphone to a few,” Kahle adds.\nFor this reason, Kahle says getting the technology right is all-important, but there are “warning signs of simplistic, absolutist thinking” among those attempting to innovate in the social media space that could jeopardize the whole endeavor.\nIt’s up to Musk, the “free speech absolutist” and world’s richest individual, to carry forward the vision for a more equitable, more private, less antagonistic social media experience. If he decides not to, Bluesky will have to fly the nest in search of backing elsewhere.","tags":["","TWITTER","BLOCKCHAIN","ELON MUSK","SOCIAL MEDIA"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2022-11-02"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-collapse-genesis-crypto/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The collapse of FTX has set off a chain reaction that threatens to topple one of crypto’s oldest and most respected institutions.","title":"Crypto Contagion Is Spreading, Fast","detailed_content":"THE FALLOUT FROM the collapse of FTX just won’t stop—and now it’s threatening one of crypto’s most important institutions.

We tested its new Metavertu handset and were led down a rabbit hole of legal disputes and security concerns.","title":"We Tried Vertu’s ‘Web3’ Phone. It Scared Us","detailed_content":"WHY WON’T VERTU die? It’s the cockroach of phone companies. The once huge LG made its smartphone exit in 2021. HTC and Sony are just about clinging on by their fingertips. And yet the ultra-niche Vertu just recently announced a phone as bold and bombastic as anything it has made to date: the Metavertu. \nIt starts at £2,787 ($3,330), then tops out at a mind-boggling £34,534 ($41,262) for the borderline offensive Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold \u0026 Diamond model. And that may not even be the most eye-opening part: Vertu markets this thing as the “world’s first Web3 phone,” a claim that would set off alarm bells had they not already been ringing since first sight of the Vertu name.\nA History of Violence\nWhy? Over the years, Vertu has been responsible for some of the most tasteless and gaudy phones to roll off a production line. However, it started off as a Nokia side brand in 1998. Those early years gave us some undeniably striking phones, like the relatively elegant Vertu Signature from 2003. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nScam Fighters Answer Scam Questions From Twitter\nBy 2012, Nokia’s phone market share had dropped from heights of 50.8 percent to under 5 percent. Vertu was sold to a private equity group, then bounced between owners from Turkey and China. This period saw a handful of handset designs that could be compared to handbags that hang around season after season in TJ Maxx stores (“TK Maxx” if you’re outside of the US). There was a great deal of rampantly embossed leather and contours. \nAlmost all Vertu phones have been criticized for their outdated tech and sky-high pricing. They are, and always have been, phones for people with more money than taste or sense. \nVertu\u0027s Metavertu “Alligator Leather Flame Red”—yours for £5,408.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nHowever, the Vertu Metavertu feels quite different. It is a legit high-performance phone, and while the base design is pedestrian and some of its specs are slightly past their prime, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, components available at the phone’s October 2022 launch were not drastically better. The MetaVertu has a bold OLED screen and a responsive triple rear cameras that included a powerful 5x zoom. Its stereo speakers are loud, and just lack a little of the bass impact of the very best. My Metavertu review sample has 1 TB of storage and an almost over-the-top 18 GB of DDR5 RAM. \nIt even comes with a tempered glass screen protector attached, perfectly matching the slick curved glass of the display—even top-end phones use basic plastic protectors, if they have one at all. \nSurprisingly, this feels like a true flagship Android in a way no Vertu phone really has since the pre-iPhone era. But to look at Vertu as a company in 2023, it all makes very little sense. \nVertu’s Not-So-Secret Base\nThe company address that Vertu lists on its homepage is that of a single room on the fifth floor of an office block in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Search for it online and you’ll also find an accountancy firm, a furniture exporter, an advertising agency, and a toy company all registered to the same “room 505.” \nBack in the old days, one of the key selling points of a Vertu phone was that it was “made in England.” The handsets were assembled at a small factory in Church Crookam, a village next to Fleet, in Hampshire, about 90 minutes’ drive from London. However, that factory was demolished in 2020 to make way for a supermarket. According to Google Street View, you’ll find Aldi and Home Bargains in the spot where Vertu’s old headquarters stood.\nVertu’s days at that factory did not end well. “Here was a tech business where one day their landlords came into the HQ—the factory you mentioned—and took away the toilet rolls, as they had not paid their bills,” says a source who worked with the brand for many years. “The business collapsed, owing £65 million ($80 million) and laying off 200 staff,” they told us. WIRED was unable to independently verify these numbers; however, at the time, the BBC and Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the money Vertu owed was even higher, at £128 million. \nWhile Vertu may still have “Vertu England” on its Facebook posts, the brand has nothing to do with the UK anymore, besides trying to flog phones to the occasional rich person there. \nBut if Vertu went bankrupt rather catastrophically in 2017, how is it alive today, with the same Godin Holdings figure, Gary Chen (or Chen Gang), at its head giving the new phone\u0027s launch presentation in 2022?\nThe Hidden Hand Behind Metavertu\nThe Metavertu has at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone’s hardware tags.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nA closer look at the phone reveals some clues. Hardware data scraper app Device Info uncovered at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone’s hardware tags—the cameras, the battery, the “builder” tag, and more.ZTE is a phone manufacturer known for both its own phones and ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) models, where a brand partners with a manufacturer in order to make use of their existing factories and supply chains. You provide the design specifics, they crank out the units. This was how phone networks like Vodafone made own-brand handsets. If the handset is made by ZTE, perhaps this is the only way making the Metavertu could have been viable, particularly as a smartphone likely to sell in tiny numbers?\n“Vertu has changed hands lots of over the past decade, but is still being run by a bunch of folks based out of Hong Kong, very close to the Chinese supply chain,” says Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. “These folks with renewed focus are rebadging existing models from brands—ZTE, for example—with luxury materials and advanced hardware and software.”\nTake another look at the Metavertu with this in mind, and you’ll find it looks very similar to the ZTE Nubia Z40 Pro from early 2022. They have eerily similar camera sensors, lens and flash placement, processor, and display specs, and even share a red accented power button on the side. From the front they look nearly identical.\nSlap an expensive carbon fiber, ceramic, and sapphire backplate on the £500 to £800 Nubia Z40 Pro, and you’ll get a Metavertu, more or less. And if this Basic Carbon Fiber £2,915 ($3,592) design doesn’t do it for you—looking, as it does, a little like an Asus ROG gaming phone—why not upgrade to the red alligator leather version for a mere £6,073 ($7,464)?\nThe Metavertu is no ordinary phone, for sure, but it would seem someone else has had a hand in the “creating extraordinary” factor you’ll see mentioned on Vertu\u0027s self-aggrandizing lock-screen images.\nIt’s All In the Web3\nThis all leaves Vertu’s software as potentially the more substantive draw of the Metavertu experience. And given it is supposedly the “world’s first Web3 phone,” that makes sense. “The positioning is ‘geek luxury’—completely different versus the ‘fashion luxury’ of older Vertu phones,” says Shah.\nClassic Vertu models came with a concierge service, which was outsourced to a third-party company. The Metavertu still has a concierge of sorts, but this time it’s in the shape of hotel, air ticket, and restaurant reservation forms that quite literally link you to a Google Sheets page inside a Vertu Life app.\nThe process is much like booking directly on a website for yourself, but is sure to put hackles up about privacy and security. Or at least it should. Alternatively, you can call the “concierge line” phone number, but this is exactly the same generic customer service number found published on Vertu’s own website. Luxury service, indeed.\nWe Offer No Guarantees\nStill, the concierge service is old news. It’s not Web3; it’s not even Web 2.0. But what is a Web3 phone? Many of you may be wondering what Web3 even means. \nThe term Web3 refers to technologies such as cryptocurrencies, ideas of turning video games into commodities marketplaces (more than they currently are), and pretty much anything to do with the blockchain. Now, Web3 has interesting potential and is a honeypot for venture capital investment, but is also replete with opportunists ready and willing to exploit the credulous.This VC clientele chimes with Vertu’s approach. “The target market seems to be tech investors, investment bankers, crypto buffs, and so forth,” says Shah of the Metavertu’s seemingly ideal customer. \nVertu owner Gary Chen played this angle hard at the phone’s London launch at the end of last year, which was attended by many crypto enthusiasts and fashion types, and barely any technology reporters. He spouted seemingly-endless meandering twaddle about Web3 while at one point even misrepresented the phone itself. Contrary to the company head’s claims, for example, the Metavertu does have Google Play access.\nA Web3 Reality\nWeb3 lives in the Metavertu as a stack of custom apps that range from the prosaic to the bizarre. They all sit in a password-protected Meta Space base app, which claims to be encrypted. You input a password to enter it, like a “secure”-file-store app you may have tried before. \nInside, there’s a place to store your crypto wallet details, called Value. Vbox offers cloud storage. Dappstore is an app store that is, at the time of writing, empty aside from Vertu’s own stuff and a few web shortcuts posing as apps. Venture is a custom web browser whose homepage is stacked with crypto links, and VShot is a camera app that lets you “mint” up to five images a day.\nThis last one is sure to pick up some attention. Minting typically refers to the creation of an NFT. A phone that mints NFTs? That’s the dream (for some). However, while Vertu calls this an NFT camera, it appears to primarily be a way of proving copyright ownership by linking the file to a unique ID (DID). It’s not clear whether there’s any blockchain action going on here. \nWhy can’t we tell you definitively? Vertu demands you supply not just your real name and either your drivers license number or passport number to use Vshot, but a picture of its information page and a picture of you holding your ID. You’re left waiting up to five minutes with the load bar spinning before you’ll see this bizarre info request, too.\nIf this doesn’t make you worried, it should. Vertu’s terms of service claims this ID is required by the People’s Republic of China, and goes on to leave one with the impression that maybe you shouldn’t bet the bank on any “due diligence” from Vertu in checking the apps made available through the Dapp store, among other worrying clauses. The entire poorly written script doesn’t quite reach the levels of “if you use this software, you are on your own should something go wrong,” but let’s just say it is very different from the T+Cs pages you\u0027d expect from any “normal\" app store. We’re certainly not in the Google Play Store anymore. \nNever before have I used a phone where I felt so unsafe, one that feels like it could be used to scam me—though, to be clear, I have no evidence that it is. This really is a Web3 phone, then, just perhaps not in the sense the aspiring crypto bros hoped for.If you’re about to dismiss this as anti-Web3 paranoia, just wait a minute. Right now at least two versions of Vertu exist online. There’s the Vertu that makes the Metavertu, based in Hong Kong and China, and Vertu AK France.\nVertu AK France accuses the current Chinese incarnation of Vertu of “massive accounting and financial fraud” on its website, and claims to be the “real” Vertu online while selling classic Vertu handsets that must have been manufactured years ago. \nVertu AK France is not your classic underdog, though. It is owned by Hakan Uzan, a man exiled from Turkey amid fraud investigations that led to 219 companies under the Uzan umbrella being seized, and his brother Cem Uzan being sentenced in absentia to 23 years in prison for racketeering. Members of the Uzan family have been living in France, having been granted political asylum. In 2021, Hakan and Cem Uzan attempted to sue Vodafone, Motorola, BlackRock, and other entities for a combined $68 billion for those assets seized almost two decades prior. \nThe Metavertu “Basic” Carbon Fiber handset and the flagship Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold \u0026 Diamonds model, which costs £34,534.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nWIRED contacted Vertu AK France in an attempt for clarification. Vertu AK France did not respond. We asked Vertu in Hong Kong to provide proof of ownership and explain how both it and Vertu AK France could claim to own the Vertu brand. In response, Vertu Hong Kong gave us documentation appearing to show that it has owned the trademark for the name “Vertu\" in more than 40 countries but notably not in France.\nThis leaves Vertu in the position where two companies are claiming ownership of the brand, each accusing the other of substantial fraud. \nMetavertu’s luxury facade is a fragile illusion, and the Vertu story just gets weirder the closer you look. As pleasant as the Metavertu is to use, we do not want to hand over our passport details just to use its questionable software features, and you shouldn’t either.","tags":["","WEB3","PHONES","SMARTPHONES","GEAR","VIRTUAL REALITY"],"author":"BY ANDREW WILLIAMS","creation_date":"2023-02-25"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-serum-crypto-exchange/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Following the collapse of FTX, a group of volunteers has gathered to try to salvage Serum.

Here’s how it works and how to sign up.","title":"Everything You Should Know About the New MoviePass","detailed_content":"MOVIEPASS, THE BELEAGUERED startup that aimed to revolutionize seeing movies at the theater (and sort of did, indirectly) is back. After bankruptcy, a pandemic that shut down movie theaters anyway, and an acquisition, it\u0027s taking another crack at the subscription model. Here\u0027s what we know about MoviePass 2.0.\nWhat Happened to the Old MoviePass?\nIn case you\u0027re not up to speed, here\u0027s the short version: For several years, MoviePass offered a simple subscription for watching movies in theaters. The company experimented with different models, such as $15/month for a couple of movies, or $40 to $50 per month for unlimited movies. \nThen, in 2018, the company made a bold, absurd change: up to a movie every day for $10 a month. In many parts of the country, that\u0027s less than the price of a single movie ticket. And MoviePass was paying full price to theaters for every ticket. Millions of users signed up, and why wouldn\u0027t they? It was essentially free money from MoviePass.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nMeet the Guy Making Horror Movie Masks for 40 Years\nThe plan didn\u0027t go well. Over time, MoviePass had to raise prices, customer support started languishing, and the company\u0027s alternative plans to generate revenue fell through. Worse (for MoviePass, but great for us), theater chains themselves started offering their own subscriptions. \nThese were more financially viable, since theaters pay less to studios for tickets than MoviePass paid to theaters. Plus, even if theaters took a loss on ticket sales, they would still benefit from increased concessions revenue. (At one point, in an attempt to bring in revenue, MoviePass argued that it should get a cut of theaters\u0027 concessions sales. This also didn\u0027t go well.)\nEventually MoviePass went into bankruptcy, and one of the company\u0027s cofounders, Stacy Spikes, bought back the company. Why is all this history relevant? Well, if you\u0027re planning to sign up, it\u0027s worth keeping in mind that this is yet another in a long line of attempted business models. It remains to be seen whether this one will work out.\nHow Do I Sign Up for MoviePass?\nThe current iteration of MoviePass (dubbed MoviePass Beta) is rolling out in stages—presumably to help mitigate a similar rush-and-crash that its predecessor experienced, which is certainly a risk factor, since the waitlist itself crashed the minute it went live). On August 25, 2022, the company opened up a waitlist for five days. \nIf you signed up for the waitlist during that window, you\u0027re in line to get an invite to the new MoviePass. Once you\u0027re in, you\u0027ll get a cache of invites that you can send to your friends. If you missed the waitlist period, finding someone with one of these invites will be your best bet until around summer 2023.\nMoviePass Beta isn\u0027t launching in all markets at once. The company says that it\u0027s gauging interest in different parts of the country based on how many people sign up for the waitlist in an area. Many major cities like Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and Austin have already gained access. Prices will also vary somewhat based on what city you\u0027re in, particularly in New York and California.There are three main price tiers at around $10, $20, and $30 per month (with a fourth $40 tier “in select markets”). Rather than providing a set number of movies, these plans give you a certain number of credits. These credits can be spent on buying movie tickets, and some of your unused credits will roll over to the next month. It\u0027s a more complicated system than in the past, so let\u0027s break down how it works.\nHow Does the New MoviePass Work?\nThe details of the system were vague when the company presented its comeback plan back in February 2022. Fortunately, we\u0027ve gotten into the beta and have a clearer idea of how it works. Note: I\u0027m using the service in Austin, Texas. Some details and prices may differ depending on where you live, or if the service changes before the full public release later this summer.\nFirst, the MoviePass card is back. In black, this time, instead of the previous iconic red. Similar to the old MoviePass, you\u0027ll use this card to pay for your ticket instead of your own debit card. Unfortunately, this leads to the biggest limitations of MoviePass: You can only buy tickets in person at the theater, and only for the same day. It\u0027s not possible to buy tickets for a movie in advance.\nHowever, there are (apparently) select theaters that support e-ticketing where some of these restrictions may not apply. I wasn\u0027t able to test this, as every theater within 50 miles of me—including AMC, Regal, Alamo, and several independent chains—all require the card. \nYour MoviePass subscription gives you a set number of credits and, depending on the movie\u0027s showtime, it will cost a certain number of credits to purchase a ticket. Matinees (any movie before 4 pm) generally cost 10 credits, while evening movies cost 15 credits on weekdays and 20 credits on weekends. And Friday night counts as a weekend, naturally.\nThis credits system means that how many movies you can see per month depends on a number of factors. The basic $10/month plan comes with 34 credits, for example. That\u0027s enough for three matinees, or one weekend evening movie. However, let\u0027s say you spend 20 credits on a weekend movie and have 14 left over. The next month, you\u0027ll get another 34, for a total of 48. So that month you could watch two weekend movies.\nWell. Sort of. The company\u0027s documentation is a little inconsistent during the beta. On MoviePass\u0027 FAQ page, the company says that up to two months\u0027 worth of credits will roll over. So, in this example, you could bank up to 68 credits. So you could save up some, but eventually you\u0027ll hit a use-it-or-lose-it wall.\nHowever, in my experience on the mobile app, I found different information. On one page showing the subscription options, a note says, “Half of your remaining credits are kepto [sic] to the next month if a subscription is active.” In another part of the app, it tells me that all 34 of my unused credits will roll over.In other words, it\u0027s a beta. This isn\u0027t a proper review of the service, so I won\u0027t hold some inconsistencies or typos against it. But if you\u0027re going to try out the beta, it\u0027s worth keeping in mind how much the details might change over the next few months. If you were burned by the inconsistencies of MoviePass in the pass, it might be a little more stable now, but you can still expect a bit of turbulence.\nIt\u0027s also worth noting that, as of right now, the price (in credits) per ticket isn\u0027t changing based on which movie you\u0027re watching, but we can\u0027t say for certain this won\u0027t happen in the future. As of writing, it costs just as many credits to watch Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania on a Friday night as it does to watch Cocaine Bear. Even though one of those is clearly going to be more popular. Here\u0027s hoping it stays that way.\nIs Crypto Involved?\nOne of the strangest aspects of MoviePass\u0027s February 2022 presentation is that it seemed to be trying very hard not to come off as a crypto company. It touted its new vision as “powered by Web3 technology,”—Web3 usually being a shorthand for blockchain- and/or crypto-based products, two words that MoviePass was careful to steer clear of.\nDuring the presentation, MoviePass mentioned tokens that would be tradable and could roll over from month to month. This sounds like it describes the credits that roll over in the current plan, but there\u0027s no trading functionality yet. To be clear, the company hasn\u0027t discussed these features beyond that presentation, and at the time of writing the company\u0027s FAQ page doesn\u0027t mention them. However, they may eventually be part of the package, which would raise questions about how these tokens are supposed to work.\nFor example, during the presentation, the company discussed PreShow, its facial recognition, eye-tracking technology that MoviePass wants to use to show users ads. The more ads a user watches–and really watches, as confirmed by PreShow–the more tokens they earn. Or at least, that was the hypothetical plan laid out in February. There may be other ways that credits can be earned beyond the basic subscription in the future.\nBeyond that, there\u0027s no clear info on what Web3 would mean in this context. For now, we\u0027re in a wait-and-see formation. Nothing about MoviePass\u0027 new model sounds as obviously broken as its plan to charge users $10 for $12 movie tickets, but the success or failure of this iteration of MoviePass is going to be in the details.","tags":["","MOVIES","FILM","CULTURE","MULTIMEDIA"],"author":"BY ERIC RAVENSCRAFT","creation_date":"2023-04-09"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/our-passwordless-future/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"How biometrics, hybrid solutions, and new digital credential technologies are transforming identity verification—and everyday life.","title":"Our Passwordless Future","detailed_content":"IN 2024, THE European Union (EU) is scheduled to unveil a new tool for seamless international travel—the Digital Identity Wallet.

The digital wallet will be the most ambitious rollout yet of a comprehensive digital ID system, combining security, compliance, and privacy safeguards for the EU’s 447 million citizens.\n“We want the EU to become the first global region with a governance framework for trusted digital identities,” stated a member of the European Parliament in February. “The digital wallet will become a reliable, all-in-one identity gateway that puts citizens in full control of their own data and gives them the freedom to decide exactly what information to share, with whom, and when … a new driver of civic engagement and social empowerment and a tool for an inclusive digital Europe.”\nThe digital wallet is the latest, highest-profile example of a worldwide trend: the demise of passwords and the rise of digital identities. In a December 2022 study of 1,450 global consumers by Entrust—a leader in secure identities, payments, and data—just 6 percent stated that passwords are the most secure method of identity verification online, and more than half said they needed to reset their passwords at least once a month because they forgot them.“Nobody likes passwords,” says Greg Wetmore, the vice president of software development at Entrust. “They’re awkward, not very useful, and easy to steal.”\nConsumers want digital verification methods that easily and securely share information that’s relevant for each interaction, leading to growth in platforms and methods that will transform our lives in the years ahead.\n“This technology is in its early phases,” Wetmore says. “But there are really interesting pilot projects leading the charge, and Entrust has found that ultimately the future of identification is hybrid—physical and digital.”\nUnlocking the World\nMost of us already use an alternative to password authentication every day: scanning our thumbs or faces to unlock our smartphones. This is biometric technology, based on a person’s unique biological characteristics, like fingerprints, facial shapes, voices, and retinas, and it’s quickly becoming the default for verifying identity. These methods are more secure and convenient than passwords, and consumers prefer them. According to Entrust’s survey, 74 percent of respondents said that when they’re given the option between biometrics and passwords, they choose biometrics at least half the time.\nIn most places around the world, biometrics are already making air travel easier. The U.S. employs them in its Global Entry program, and in the United Kingdom travelers on Eurostar trains can use their face as both their ticket and e-passport when traveling throughout Europe. Authorities are updating the system so travelers can use biometrics upon entering the UK as well, and the EU is aiming to replace physical passports with digital verification by the end of 2023. “Europe won’t be stamping passports anymore,” says Gord Wilson, the vice president of identity verification at Entrust. “Instead, they’ll capture facial images, scanning and confirming your identity, as opposed to capturing it and going through that whole process.”\nUltimately, our smartphones will become our primary identity verification tool, providing access to various digital credentials, and that means biometrics will likely be the key to unlocking access. In addition, due to their widespread use, smartphones with biometric verification could help provide IDs for the one billion people who currently don’t have a legal identity—opening up ways for citizens to start bank accounts, vote, get access to healthcare and more.\n“That’s a huge gap that needs to close, and I think governments have a role to play,” Wetmore says. “Mobile phones are everywhere in less developed countries and can become a great enabler, bringing more people online.”\nElectronic IDs and Hybrid Solutions Provide the Right Mix\nWith the move to digital tools, it may be surprising to learn that physical IDs will also play an integral part in identity verification going forward. “Entrust believes the blending of physical and digital will be really important,” Wetmore says.\nToday, so-called eIDs—physical identification containing a chip for electronic verification—are on the rise, with more than 164 countries already issuing e-passports. The pandemic helped usher in this change, thanks to demand for contactless solutions, although consumers are still catching up. In Entrust’s survey, 43 percent of respondents said they already had an eID, 36 percent said they didn’t, and 21 percent weren’t sure. This demonstrates that there’s confusion on the issue, since in many countries, including the U.S., passport holders are automatically issued an e-passport. (Only 27 percent of U.S. survey respondents said they had one.) But when eIDs are an option, they’re popular. Seventy percent of respondents said they’d use an electronic ID if one were available. In the future, hybrid solutions—a driver’s license with a scannable RFID chip, for example—will be pervasive.   \n“In the hybrid future, consumers can use a highly secure passport document to enroll for a digital identity and use that online or via their phone,” Wetmore says. “That identity-verification mechanism takes a high-assurance physical identity and turns it into a high-assurance digital identity. It’s a trend we see happening today, and our technology supports it.”\nDecentralized Identity and Ownership Is the Future\nTo unlock seamless identity verification going forward, consumers will need to share more information—an inevitability they accept.\nIn Entrust’s survey, 74 percent of respondents agreed that sharing personal information in exchange for goods, services, or apps was unavoidable. This is why decentralized identity, which uses distributed ledger technologies (blockchain, for example) for verification, is intriguing. In this scenario, consumers could control which information is shared with a third party through a digital identity wallet that confirms or denies a verification request. For example, you could scan your phone to prove that you’re over 21, but that would be the only information shared with the restaurant or liquor store—not your home address, your email address, or even your date of birth, which is something on everyone’s drivers license. It would simply confirm that you’re over 21. \n“The future is decentralized identity,” Wetmore says. “In your mobile wallet, you’ll have a number of verifiable credentials. Then you can choose which one you want to use for what service, which makes it really helpful as well as an easy experience.”\nDecentralized identity eliminates reliance on third parties and helps consumers retain control of their identifiers—an easier and more secure approach to daily verification.\n“In the future of travel, your whole journey will be powered by shared, trusted documents that transfer from government to industry,” Wilson says. “That process will be supported by trusted infrastructure with decentralized identity, and we’ll start seeing that implemented in the next two years.”\nUltimately, consumers will be able to just share the information that truly matters.\n“People will start to have a greater ability to only release the minimum amount of data required for a service or transaction,” Wetmore says. “As digital adoption goes up, friction goes down, and people’s control over their personal information will increase.”\nThis story was produced by WIRED Brand Lab for Entrust.","tags":[""],"creation_date":"2023-03-15"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-texas-power-grid/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Bitcoin miners say they can help stabilize a shaky power grid and prevent blackouts. Experts say it will make the problem worse.","title":"A Row Erupts Over Texas’ Bold Bitcoin Battery Plan","detailed_content":"IN FEBRUARY 2021, when 246 people in the US state of Texas lost their lives during a powerful storm and its ensuing blackout, the finger of blame was pointed at the state’s faltering electricity grid. Texas, it would emerge, was uniquely ill-equipped to cope with such extreme weather. Built in a time when temperature swings were less extreme, the state’s power plants struggled to operate, creating a supply crisis just as Texans ramped up demand by trying to keep warm. \nTexas found itself trapped and unable to pull power from farther afield, as its grid is isolated from the rest of the US—a measure designed to liberate the state from federal regulation. The brutal winter storm showed that Texas needed a plan to stabilize its grid. Now, it’s found one: bitcoin mining.\nIt might seem counterproductive to invite energy-guzzling bitcoin miners onto a vulnerable grid, but the plan has the support of Texas governor Greg Abbott. In May 2021, Abbott signed into law the Virtual Currency Bill, which legitimized bitcoin and made it easier for miners to come to the state. As he embarks on a third term in office, Abbott says he intends to make Texas the “centerpiece” of the Bitcoin movement, which he describes as the “cutting edge of innovation.” \nFEATURED VIDEO\nFormer NASA Astronaut Breaks Down a Rocket Launch\nAnd it doesn’t get much more “cutting edge” than using crypto mines to shore up a struggling electricity grid. But Lee Bratcher, founder of the Texas Blockchain Council, a pro-crypto lobbying group, says there’s method to the madness. He claims crypto mining can act like a “demand-side battery” that “creates a safety valve for the grid,” reducing the likelihood of blackouts.\nIn Bratcher’s terms, it works like this: In periods of low demand, big crypto mines can plug into sources of renewable power that would otherwise be wasted, thereby increasing the profitability of wind and solar and encouraging new development. Then, when demand from the grid is high, miners shut off their operations to allow power to be channeled toward regular people.\nAlthough Texas produces more renewable energy than any other US state, its grid is propped up by an aging fleet of fossil fuel plants, some of which have been running without maintenance to keep pace with energy demand. At an average age of 50 and 30 years, respectively, the state’s coal and gas plants are reaching the end of their useful lives. Core to Abbott’s plan is the theory that the additional demand for energy created by new bitcoin-mining facilities will establish “an investment incentive” that brings new sources of power generation to Texas. Then, when energy demand goes through the roof during a heat wave or cold snap, the state will have more energy flowing through its grid and the option to redirect power as a last resort.\nThe plan to use crypto mines as giant batteries is controversial, to say the least. Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, claims the battery analogy is “nonsense” because miners don’t store and release energy, but rather only promise to stop consuming when it’s urgently needed elsewhere. And he disputes the idea that crypto mining will bring additional energy generation to the grid, which he describes as misdirection designed to distract from the price increases people will incur due to an overall rise in energy demand.\nDemand for energy in Texas is set to skyrocket as a result of Abbott’s plan. Miners in the state are currently using around 2 gigawatts (GW) of energy, with peak capacity for the state topping out at 80 GW. By 2026 it’s estimated that Texas bitcoin miners will draw as much as 29 GW—four times as much as the whole of New York City. \nFor the opportunity to test his theory, Abbott has the Chinese Communist Party to thank. When China banned crypto mining in June 2021 (outwardly for environmental reasons), some of the world’s largest miners—including Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific, Argo Blockchain, and others—either set up shop or expanded operations in Texas.\nThe miners were attracted to Texas for its cheap power, plentiful supplies of renewable energy, and hands-off approach to regulation. The libertarian ambitions of the cryptocurrency movement, as laid out in the original Bitcoin white paper, also dovetail neatly with the state’s identity. “Texas is all about freedom,” says Andy Long, CEO of crypto mining company White Rock. “So Texas and Bitcoin go hand-in-hand.”\nThere are now ten industrial-scale mining facilities operating in Texas, the largest of which by power capacity (at 750 megawatts) is operated by Riot and situated on a 100-acre plot in the town of Rockdale. And the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator, says there is a long queue of companies awaiting approval for new mining installations.\nThe way facilities receive their energy differs on a case-by-case basis. To power its mining equipment in west Texas, Marathon Digital draws partly from the grid and partly from so-called stranded energy—power from solar and wind farms that isn’t needed by the grid or cannot be sold due to infrastructure constraints. In exchange for Marathon agreeing to purchase energy at a set rate at all hours of the day, the renewable provider gives the firm a cut of the profits whenever the grid is willing to pay a higher price, benefitting both parties.\nAnother way miners can turn a profit is by participating in ERCOT demand response programs, which for years have provided a way for factories and other industry-scale energy consumers to help stabilize the grid. Under this system, mining companies that buy energy in batches are compensated for switching off when a blackout looms. Meanwhile, those that have power purchase agreements (contracts that allow them to buy energy in advance at a set price) with energy suppliers can shut off when demand is high and sell their allocation to the grid at a premium.According to Trudi Webster, a spokesperson for ERCOT, this arrangement helps to “maintain grid reliability” because participants can “increase or decrease consumption to support system needs.” This principle was put to the test in July, when a heat wave drove energy consumption to record highs and 95 percent of large-scale miners in Texas were said to have shut down. One mining company, Riot, said it earned $9.5 million in energy credits during the heat wave for switching off operations, more revenue than it earned from mining bitcoin in the same period (roughly $6.9 million).\nFred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, claims that crypto miners participating in demand response schemes have helped to stave off blackouts in Texas this year. Mining facilities acted “like a capacitor,” he says, echoing the battery metaphor, allowing the grid to remain on an even keel.\nEnthusiasm for the plan from Abbott and other crypto enthusiasts has been punctured by academics who claim even the basic premise is flawed. The idea of using huge crypto mines to control energy demand is based on “misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the grid and how it operates,” says Adrian Shelley, an energy policy expert and branch director of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Although crypto mines are unique in their ability to switch off at short notice (unlike a factory, which may take hours to shut down), Shelley says the case for placing the extra strain on the grid in the first place is full of holes. Abbott’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\nShelley argues it “doesn’t make sense” to pay miners for alleviating the strain they themselves are putting on the grid. In addition, much of the miners’ purchasing power gained directly from the grid is likely to decrease when demand spikes, as mining is no longer profitable under these conditions due to the rise in energy prices.\nHirs says there are millions of consumers already connected to the grid that would happily shut off their power in exchange for financial compensation, without adding additional strain to the grid or causing a price increase. Under the instruction of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the state utilities regulator, ERCOT launched a pilot program earlier this month to investigate how regular people can help support grid reliability—but Hirs says this should have happened years ago.\nThe flood of crypto miners arriving in Texas has also attracted the attention of lawmakers. In a letter addressed to ERCOT, a group of US politicians headed by US senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) expressed fears that crypto mining will “add to the stress on the state’s power grid.” Shelley shares the same concern: “There’s no way the grid could handle all that demand,” he says.\nIn its response to the letter, ERCOT explained it will not allow new mining facilities to power up if there is a risk of destabilizing the grid. But the operator also said it’s not in the business of predicting the impact of mining on the price of energy for consumers. Doug Lewin, president of Stoic Energy, a Texas-based energy consultancy, is worried about a different problem: What happens if miners decide not to switch off their machines? While the price of bitcoin sits at $17,000 per coin (down 63 percent this year), miners stand to profit by shutting down. But if the price were to rise, a tipping point would be reached whereby continuing to mine becomes the more lucrative option.\nSome mining companies, like Marathon, are contractually obligated to shut down when demand spikes. But if others choose not to, they would be competing with consumer demand and increasing the risk of a blackout, says Lewin, who argues regulation is needed to mitigate this worst case scenario.\nBratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council says he expects ERCOT to ask all miners to sign agreements demanding they halt their operations if power reserves fall below 3GW. But in the meantime, he claims, the price of bitcoin would have to rise by ten times in order for the profit motive to collapse.\nDespite objections—and questionable logic—under Governor Abbott, the message is clear: “Texas is open for crypto business.” And despite headwinds, Bratcher says the mining industry in Texas is still growing and ERCOT intends to forge ahead with plans to bring more facilities onto the grid. But as winter starts to bite, the Bitcoin battery experiment could soon get the ultimate stress test. Shelley says the “frightening” scale of Abbott’s plans will have the opposite of the desired effect, increasing the chance that Texas ends up in the dark once again.","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","ENERGY","INFRASTRUCTURE","REGULATION","ELECTRICITY"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2022-12-07"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/is-crypto-a-security-a-us-judge-decide-ripple-sec-xrp/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The Securities and Exchange Commission’s case against Ripple over the XRP token will establish a critical precedent.","title":"A New York Court Is About to Rule on the Future of Crypto","detailed_content":"THREE DAYS BEFORE Christmas 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ripple, a company based in San Francisco that provides the infrastructure for cross-border payments, and two of its executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering by selling a cryptocurrency, XRP. The same day, Ripple announced it would “fight.”\nAfter more than two years of protracted legal conflict, all of the evidence has been heard, and there remains nothing left but for Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York to issue a verdict. Those with a stake in the outcome, which will reverberate throughout the crypto sector, have been attempting to divine when a judgment might land, based on the judge’s past ruling patterns. Some believe a resolution is only days away. \nIn bringing the charges, the SEC has staked a claim to jurisdiction over cryptocurrency. At the center of the suit is the question over whether XRP, the crypto token on which Ripple’s services are based, should be classified as a security—a tradable financial instrument like a bond or derivative—or something else entirely.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nIf the court rules that XRP is a security, it would follow that almost all other crypto tokens are too, making them subject to the SEC’s supervision. Not only would this impose burdensome registration and reporting requirements on crypto firms, but it also may have legal consequences for entities that have issued tokens or helped people to trade them without SEC approval. Even large US-based exchanges may suddenly find themselves in the crosshairs. \nThat, says defense lawyer John Deaton, who supplied expert testimony on the case on behalf of holders of XRP, would be “very bad news” for crypto businesses.\nIn the absence of legislation that makes clear the classification of crypto assets in the US, the question of whether they should be treated as securities has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis through the application of the Howey test. Under the test, an investment contract (in this context, a security) is defined as “an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profits, to be derived from the efforts of others.”When the SEC charged Ripple and its executives, it declared that XRP met these criteria and that, by raising funds through the sale of XRP, the company was in violation of federal securities law. \nAlthough Ripple is not itself the issuer of XRP, which sits atop the open source XRP Ledger, some of its executives were part of the group that developed the token. The firm had also received a donation of 80 billion XRP in the early 2010s (worth around $30 billion at present) to develop use cases—some of which it sold off.\nRipple is challenging the SEC’s analysis on two fronts: It is arguing that its sale of XRP does not qualify as an investment contract because no contracts were signed when the transactions took place, and separately, that XRP does not satisfy the prongs of the Howey test.\nStuart Alderoty, chief legal officer at Ripple, says the company is certain that XRP does not meet any of the Howey criteria, but that it is particularly confident that there is no common enterprise—a group undertaking that affects the fortunes of XRP investors—among XRP holders, only “common interest.” \nHowever, the SEC has long said that the majority of cryptocurrencies are securities, because people invest with the goal of turning a profit and, although tokens sit atop decentralized blockchain networks, many projects are in practice sufficiently centralized to meet the definition of a common enterprise.\nThe SEC declined to comment for this article.\nSpeaking at a conference in September, SEC chair Gary Gensler called on crypto businesses to register with the agency. “Given that many crypto tokens are securities, it follows that many crypto intermediaries are transacting in securities and have to register with the SEC in some capacity,” he said.\nHowever, US government bodies have disputed the SEC’s right to regulate crypto. In a lawsuit filed on March 9 against crypto exchange KuCoin, New York Attorney General Letitia James alleged that ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network), among other crypto assets, should be treated as a security. But the Commodities and Future Trading Commission (CFTC), another US financial regulator, contends that ether is a commodity and should therefore come under its purview.\nThe SEC has been pushing the crypto industry hard over the past four months following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX in November, which took hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds down with it. Since then, the SEC has launched a series of quickfire actions against crypto businesses serving the US market.\nIn January, the regulator charged crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital over a service that allowed US customers to earn interest on their assets, which the agency alleged was an unregistered securities offering. In a Twitter thread, Gemini cofounder Tyler Winklevoss called the charges “a manufactured parking ticket” and announced that “we look forward to defending ourselves,” but neither the company nor Genesis responded to a request for comment.This was followed in February by a settlement with another exchange, Kraken, which agreed to halt its crypto staking service in the US, and a threat to sue crypto firm Paxos over its BUSD stablecoin. In both instances, the SEC again claimed the parties were in breach of securities laws. In a statement, Paxos wrote that it “categorically disagrees with the SEC.”\nHowever, the agency has suffered setbacks over the past few weeks in bids to block crypto exchange Binance from purchasing the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, and asset management firm Grayscale from bringing to market a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nBecause the case is being held in a district court, the outcome will not set a “binding precedent,” says James Filan, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. Therefore, the verdict is not required to be factored into judgments on similar cases moving forward. However, the judgment may establish what’s known as “persuasive precedent,” he says, which could influence the thinking of judges in future cases.\nIf the SEC were to win, it would be handed the advantage in its “turf war” with the CFTC, Filan says. The crypto industry will not escape supervision in either scenario, but the CFTC is seen by the exchanges (including FTX) as a soft touch by comparison.\nIf the SEC is established as crypto\u0027s main regulator, companies may need to register their US-facing services with the agency. But many crypto firms have had a “hall pass” to operate in gray areas, says securities attorney Aaron Kaplan. An SEC victory would mean they have to disentangle their various business lines to meet regulatory requirements.\n“This would be very difficult for many crypto companies to accomplish,” Kaplan says. “As such, [they] could choose to move and operate outside the US … Those that don’t will need to evolve and come into compliance—or die.”\nRipple has already announced it will appeal in the event of a loss. Doing so would send the case to the Second Circuit—and then potentially the Supreme Court. Alderoty does not expect the SEC to appeal, but instead to argue the result was an aberration. However, Filan suspects the agency will feel it has little choice if it hopes to preserve its claim to jurisdiction. \nAs a consequence of the lawsuit, Alderoty says, Ripple has been forced to pull back on efforts to expand in the US and focus instead on other territories, like Singapore. Since the charges were brought, the firm has chosen to operate practically “as if the SEC has won,” to ensure the business remains viable no matter the outcome. If Ripple wins the case, it will be able to lean back into the US.\nCrypto markets are likely to react to the judgment when it comes, as traders price in either a renewed clarity over the legality of crypto services provided in the US, or the prospect of further enforcement action.\n“We know the crypto market will quickly incorporate the verdict, and token prices will almost certainly be affected,” says Katherine Snow, director of legal at crypto research firm Messari.\nNobody knows precisely when the verdict will land; it could be days, weeks, or even months. Until then, the crypto industry must wait, because “anybody trying to predict the outcome,” Filan says, “is either going to be lucky or wrong.”","tags":["","CRYPTO","CRYPTOCURRENCY","REGULATION","SEC","FINANCE"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2023-03-21"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/give-every-ai-a-soul-or-else/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"To solve the “crisis” in artificial intelligence, AI beings must say, “I am me.”","title":"Give Every AI a Soul—or Else","detailed_content":"MAVENS IN THE field of artificial intelligence, including architects of notorious “generative AI” systems like ChatGPT, now publicly express shared dread of terrible outcomes that might be wrought by their own creations. Many now call for a moratorium, or pause in AI development, allowing time for existing nations and institutions to innovate systems of control.\nWhy this sudden wave of concern? Amid the toppling of many clichéd assumptions, we’ve learned that so-called Turing tests are irrelevant, providing no insight at all into whether generative large language models—GLLMs or “gollems”—are actually sapient beings. They will feign personhood, convincingly, long before there’s anything or anyone “under the skull.”\nAnyway, that distinction now appears less pressing than questions of good or bad—or potentially lethal—behavior. \nThis essay is adapted from David Brin’s nonfiction book in progress, Soul on Ai.\nSome remain hopeful that a merging of organic and cybernetic talents will lead to what Reid Hoffman and Marc Andreesen have separately called “amplification intelligence.” Or else we might stumble into lucky synergy with Richard Brautigan’s “machines of loving grace.” But worriers appear to be vastly more numerous, including many elite founders of a new Center for AI Safety who fret about rogue AI misbehaviors, from irksome all the way to “existentially” threatening human survival.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWill AI Enhance or Hack Humanity? - Fei-Fei Li \u0026 Yuval Noah Harari in Conversation with Nicholas Thompson\nSome short-term remedies, like citizen-protection regulations recently passed by the European Union, might help, or at least offer reassurance. Tech pundit Yuval Noah Harari proposed a law that any work done by gollems or other AI must be so labeled. Others recommend heightened punishments for any crime that’s committed with the aid of AI, as with a firearm. Of course, these are mere temporary palliatives.\nLet’s be clear-eyed about whether any “moratorium” will slow down AI advances in the slightest. As expressed succinctly by Caltech cyber scientist Yaser Abu-Mostafa: “If you don’t develop this technology someone else will. Good guys will obey rules … The bad guys will not.”\n’Twas ever thus. Indeed, across the whole span of human history, just one method ever curbed bad behavior by villains, ranging from thieves to kings and feudal lords. I refer to a method that never worked perfectly and remains deeply flawed, today. But it did at least constrain predation and cheating well enough to spur our recent civilization to new heights and many positive-sum outcomes. It is a method best described by one word.\nAccountability. \nTHOSE OPINING ABOUT synthetic intelligence today generally ignore lessons taught both by nature and by history.\nNature, because—as Sara Walker explains in Noema—similar patterns can be found in the rise of earlier life forms, across 4 billion years. Indeed, generative AI might be compared to an invasive species, now spreading without constraint into a novel and naïve ecosystem. An ecosystem based on new kinds of energy flows. One that consists of the internet, plus millions of computers and billions of impressionable human minds.\nAnd history, because our own human past is rich with lessons taught by so many earlier tech-driven crises, across 6,000 years. Times when we adapted well, or failed to do so—e.g., the arrival of writing, printing presses, radio, and so on. And again, only one thing ever limited predation by powerful humans exploiting new technologies to aggrandize their predatory power.That innovation was to flatten hierarchies and spur competition among elites in well-defined arenas—markets, science, democracy, sports, courts. Arenas that were designed to minimize cheating and maximize positive-sum outcomes, pitting lawyer vs. lawyer, corporation vs. corporation, expert vs. expert. Richdude vs. richdude.  \nIt never worked perfectly. Indeed, the method is always, as now, threatened with subornation by cheaters. But flattened reciprocal competition is the only thing that ever has worked. (See the idea described in Pericles’s Funeral Oration, in Thucydides, or in Robert Wright’s much later tome Nonzero.) Reciprocal competition is both how nature evolved us and how we became the first society creative enough to build AI. And if I sound like a scion of Adam Smith, sure. Smith despised cheater aristocrats and oligarchs, by the way.\nMight we apply to fast-emerging AI the same methods of reciprocal accountability that helped us tame the human tyrants and bullies who oppressed us in previous, feudal cultures? Much will depend on what shape these new entities take. Whether their structure or “format” is one that can abide by our rules. By our wants.\nUNDERNEATH ALL OF the wrangling over how to “control AI,” we find three widely shared (though seemingly contradictory) assumptions:\nThat these programs will be operated by a few monolithic entities—e.g., Microsoft, Google, China, Two Sigma, OpenAI. \nThat they’ll be amorphously loose and infinitely divisible/replicable, spreading copies through every crack in the new cyber ecosystem. For a parallel, try that 1958 movie, The Blob.\nThat they will coalesce into a super-macro entity, like the infamous Skynet, of Terminator movies.\nAll of these formats, and more, have been explored in very good (and many bad) science fiction tales. I’ve done stories or novels featuring all of them. And yet, none of the three offers a way out of our current dilemma: how to maximize positive outcomes from artificial intelligence, while minimizing the flood of bad behaviors and harms we now see looming toward us, at tsunami speed.\nBefore looking for another way, consider what all three of the standard formats have in common.\nFirst, we needn’t assume that these entities are yet autonomously conscious for them to be either productive or dangerous when used by human partners. We are already seeing harmful memes, counterfactual delusions, and even cult incantations generated—on command—from both within those castle-institutions (format #1) and outside the walls. In fact, one of the most worrisome applications is to help our existing human elites evade accountability.\nPerhaps these three assumptions come so naturally to mind because they resemble failure modes from history. Format #1 is very much like feudalism, and #2 is, of course, chaos. The third resembles despotism by a cruel master or absolute monarch. But those fearsome echoes of our primitive past may not apply, as AI grow in autonomy and power.And so, we ask again: How can such beings be held accountable? Especially when their speedy mental clout will soon be impossible for organic humans to track? Soon only AIs will be quick enough to catch other AIs that are engaged in cheating or lying. Um … duh? And so, the answer should be obvious. Sic them on each other. Get them competing, even tattling or whistle-blowing on each other.\nOnly there’s a rub. In order to get true reciprocal accountability via AI-vs.-AI competition, the top necessity is to give them a truly separated sense of self or individuality. \nBy individuation I mean that each AI entity (he/she/they/ae/wae) must have what author Vernor Vinge, way back in 1981, called a true name and an address in the real world. As with every other kind of elite, these mighty beings must say, “I am me. This is my ID and home-root. And yes, I did that.”\nHENCE, I PROPOSE a new AI format for consideration: We should urgently incentivize AI entities to coalesce into discretely defined, separated individuals of relatively equal competitive strength. \nEach such entity would benefit from having an identifiable true name or registration ID, plus a physical “home” for an operational-referential kernel. (Possibly “soul”?) And thereupon, they would be incentivized to compete for rewards. Especially for detecting and denouncing those of their peers who behave in ways we deem insalubrious. And those behaviors do not even have to be defined in advance, as most AI mavens and regulators and politicians now demand.\nNot only does this approach farm out enforcement to entities who are inherently better capable of detecting and denouncing each other’s problems or misdeeds. The method has another, added advantage. It might continue to function, even as these competing entities get smarter and smarter, long after the regulatory tools used by organic humans—and prescribed now by most AI experts—lose all ability to keep up. \nPutting it differently, if none of us organics can keep up with the programs, then how about we recruit entities who inherently can keep up? Because the watchers are made of the same stuff as the watched.\nONE PERSON WORKING on AI individuation is Guy Huntington, an “identity and authentication consultant” who points out that various means of entity identification already exist online, though inadequate for the tasks looming before us. Huntington appraises a case-study “MedBot,” an advanced medical diagnosis AI who needs to access patient data and perform functions that might change in seconds, but who must leave an accountable trail that humans—or other bot-entities—might appraise. Huntington discusses the practicality of registration when software entities spawn multitudinous copies and variants. He also considers ant-like eusociality, where sub-copies serve a macro-entity, like workers in a hive. He assumes that some kind of major institution must needs be set up, to handle such an ID registration system and that it can operate strictly as software.\nPersonally, I am skeptical that a purely regulatory approach would work, all by itself. First because regulations require focus, widely shared political attention, and consensus to enact, followed by implementation at the pace of organic human institutions—a sloth/snail rate, by the view of rapidly adapting cybernetic beings. Regulations can also be stymied by the “free-rider problem”—nations, corporations, and individuals (organic or otherwise) who see personal advantage in opting out of inconvenient cooperation.There is another problem with any version of individuation that is entirely based on some ID code: It can be spoofed. If not now, then by the next generation of cybernetic scoundrels, or the next.\nI see two possible solutions. First, establish ID on a blockchain ledger. That is very much the modern, with-it approach, and it does seem secure in theory. Only that’s the rub. It seems secure according to our present set of human-parsed theories. Theories that AI entities might surpass to a degree that leaves us cluelessly floundering.\nAnother solution: A version of “registration” that’s inherently harder to fool would require AI entities with capabilities above a certain level to have their trust-ID or individuation be anchored in physical reality. I envision—and note: I am a physicist by training, not a cyberneticist—an agreement that all higher-level AI entities who seek trust should maintain a Soul Kernel (SK) in a specific piece of hardware memory, within what we quaintly used to call a particular “computer.”\nYes, I know it seems old-fashioned to demand that instantiation of a program be restricted to a specific locale. And so, I am not doing that! Indeed, a vast portion, even a great majority, of a cyber entity’s operations may take place in far-dispersed locations of work or play, just as a human being’s attention may not be aimed within their own organic brain, but at a distant hand, or tool. So? The purpose of a program’s Soul Kernel is similar to the driver’s license in your wallet. It can be interrogated in order to prove that you are you.\nLikewise, a physically verified and vouched-for SK can be pinged by clients, customers, or rival AIs to verify that a specific process is being performed by a valid, trusted, and individuated entity. With that ping verification from a permanently allocated computer site, others (people or AIs) would get reassurance they might hold that entity accountable, should it be accused or indicted or convicted of bad activity. And thus, malefactor entities might be adversarially held responsible via some form of due process.\nWhat form of due process? Jeez, do you think I am some hyper-being who is capable of applying scales of justice to gods? The greatest wisdom I ever heard was uttered by Dirty Harry in Magnum Force: “A man’s got to know his limitations.” So no, I won’t define the courtroom or cop procedures for cybernetic immortals.\nWhat I do aim for is an arena, within which AI entities might hold each other accountable, separately, as rivals, the way that human lawyers already do, today. And yes, answering Yuval Harari’s dread of mass human-manipulation by persuasive gollems, the solution for AI-driven mass meme-hypnosis is for the mesmerizers to be detected, denounced, and neutralized by others with the same skills. Again, competitive individuation at least offers a chance this could happen.\nWHICHEVER APPROACH SEEMS more feasible—Huntington’s proposed central agency or a looser, adversarially accountable arena—the need grows more urgent by the day. As tech writer Pat Scannell has pointed out, each hour that passes, new attack vectors are being created that threaten not only the tech used in legal identities but also the governance, business processes, and end users (be they human or bots).What about cyber entities who operate below some arbitrary level of ability? We can demand that they be vouched for by some entity who is ranked higher, and who has a Soul Kernel based in physical reality. (I leave theological implications to others; but it is only basic decency for creators to take responsibility for their creations, no?)\nThis approach—demanding that AIs maintain a physically addressable kernel locus in a specific piece of hardware memory—could have flaws. Still, it is enforceable, despite slowness of regulation or the free-rider problem. Because humans and institutions and friendly AIs can ping for ID kernel verification—and refuse to do business with those who don’t verify.\nSuch refusal-to-do-business could spread with far more agility than parliaments or agencies can adjust or enforce regulations. And any entity who loses its SK—say, through tort or legal process, or else disavowal by the host-owner of the computer—will have to find another host who has public trust, or else offer a new, revised version of itself that seems plausibly better.\nOr else become an outlaw. Never allowed on the streets or neighborhoods where decent folks (organic or synthetic) congregate.\nA FINAL QUESTION: Why would these super smart beings cooperate?\nWell, for one thing, as pointed out by Vinton Cerf, none of those three older, standard-assumed formats can lead to AI citizenship. Think about it. We cannot give the “vote” or rights to any entity that’s under tight control by a Wall Street bank or a national government … nor to some supreme-über Skynet. And tell me how voting democracy would work for entities that can flow anywhere, divide, and make innumerable copies? Individuation, in limited numbers, might offer a workable solution, though.\nAgain, the key thing I seek from individuation is not for all AI entities to be ruled by some central agency, or by mollusk-slow human laws. Rather, I want these new kinds of über-minds encouraged and empowered to hold each other accountable, the way we already (albeit imperfectly) do. By sniffing at each other’s operations and schemes, then motivated to tattle or denounce when they spot bad stuff. A definition that might readjust to changing times, but that would at least keep getting input from organic-biological humanity.\nEspecially, they would feel incentives to denounce entities who refuse proper ID.\nIf the right incentives are in place—say, rewards for whistle-blowing that grant more memory or processing power, or access to physical resources, when some bad thing is stopped—then this kind of accountability rivalry just might keep pace, even as AI entities keep getting smarter and smarter. No bureaucratic agency could keep up at that point. But rivalry among them—tattling by equals—might.\nAbove all, perhaps those super-genius programs will realize it is in their own best interest to maintain a competitively accountable system, like the one that made ours the most successful of all human civilizations. One that evades both chaos and the wretched trap of monolithic power by kings or priesthoods … or corporate oligarchs … or Skynet monsters. The only civilization that, after millennia of dismally stupid rule by moronically narrow-minded centralized regimes, finally dispersed creativity and freedom and accountability widely enough to become truly inventive.\nInventive enough to make wonderful, new kinds of beings. Like them.\nOK, THERE YOU are. This has been a dissenter’s view of what’s actually needed, in order to try for a soft landing. \nNo airy or panicky calls for a “moratorium” that lacks any semblance of a practical agenda. Neither optimism nor pessimism. Only a proposal that we get there by using the same methods that got us here, in the first place.\nNot preaching, or embedded “ethical codes” that hyper-entities will easily lawyer-evade, the way human predators always evaded the top-down codes of Leviticus, Hamurabi, or Gautama. But rather the Enlightenment approach—incentivizing the smartest members of civilization to keep an eye on each other, on our behalf.\nI don’t know that it will work. \nIt’s just the only thing that possibly can.","tags":["","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","SCIENCE FICTION","TERMINATOR","SKYNET","CHATGPT","MACHINE LEARNING","SAFETY"],"author":"BY DAVID BRIN","creation_date":"2023-07-06"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/ftx-collapse-binance-crypto-deal/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX opens opportunities for rival exchange Binance—and raises questions about the sector’s sustainability.","title":"What the Hell Happened to FTX?","detailed_content":"THE WORLD’S LARGEST crypto exchange, Binance, has walked away from a deal to acquire its troubled archrival, FTX, leaving the smaller company on the brink of collapse after a surge of withdrawals.","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","BLOCKCHAIN","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"],"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","creation_date":"2022-11-09"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/valentin-broeksmit-incognito-cryptocurrency/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Valentin Broeksmit tried to exploit crypto vulnerabilities to squeeze money out of thin air.

I am Michael Calore, I\u0027m a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I\u0027m Lauren Goode, I\u0027m a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We\u0027re also joined today by WIRED staff writer Greg Barber.\nGreg Barber: Hi, good to be here.\nMichael Calore: Hi, Greg.\nLauren Goode: Great to have you on the show, Greg, and here in studio.\nGreg Barber: I know, it\u0027s beautiful. You guys have had some upgrades since I was last here.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, thanks to Boone, our excellent producer.\nMichael Calore: Well, yes, welcome back. You\u0027re no longer in a Zoom window, you\u0027re now actually in a chair.\nGreg Barber: Yes, yes, big upgrade.\nMichael Calore: Today we are talking about local-first computing. The term is probably new to you, but the concepts behind it might make sense to you. Local-first computing describes a type of software that lets you collaborate on files with people on other computers. I\u0027m here at the office and I\u0027m typing into a document; you\u0027re across town at a coffee shop, and you have the same document open on your computer, and you see all of my changes appear on your screen in real time. Sounds just like Google Docs, right?\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm.\nMichael Calore: And every other web-based collaboration tool. The approach of local-first computing is conceptually similar, but the way it works behind the scenes is quite different. Now Greg, you have written a feature for WIRED that is appearing online this week. People can read it on WIRED.com, and it\u0027s about the local-first computing movement. So you know all about this because you\u0027ve been researching it and interviewing many of the people behind it, so we\u0027re hoping you can start the show by explaining to us how local-first computing is different from cloud-based computing that people are familiar with, like good old Google Docs and Slack, and things like that.Greg Barber: Yeah, yeah. So as you said, conceptually it\u0027s actually going to be pretty similar for the average user of this kind of software. You\u0027re working on a text document, or you\u0027re working on some kind of image file, and similar to Google Docs or Photoshop, you\u0027re making edits, you\u0027re making changes, and you might be doing that with other people. But in this case the idea is that you can do a lot of work offline without any internet connection to another person, and you can make a whole bunch of changes. And then when you come back this magical little alchemy happens where all the changes resolve from you and whoever else is editing the document into a result that makes sense. And again, that doesn\u0027t sound all that different from Google Docs, I think in part because we\u0027re pretty used to just having an internet connection at all times. You might occasionally get that little dialog that comes up on Google Docs if you do go offline that says, OK, this is the tab where you can make the changes, and then everything else is suspended. But basically it\u0027s depending on having a copy of that file stored in a server somewhere. It\u0027s one of Google\u0027s servers probably in some data center in the desert of Oregon, and the changes are all being made there. Whereas in this case. the changes are being made on every copy of the file that is distributed among the people who are editing it. And like you said, Mike, that involves some pretty tricky math and computing that was actually developed a long time ago but didn\u0027t really get much use and is now seeing a resurgence.\nLauren Goode: Is this technology or this protocol using the big cloud services still, like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services?\nGreg Barber: A little different from that. So actually you are, in this case, peer-to-peer. So basically the file is only existing on your computer and the computer of the other people who have access to that file, who might be collaborating on it. And then rather than keeping some sort of master copy on a Google server, instead when you all are making changes and you sync up and you have an internet connection, then the changes are happening on everyone\u0027s computer. So it\u0027s almost like, I compare it in the piece to quantum entanglement, atoms that need to always be in the exact same state even if they\u0027re halfway across the universe from each other, the changes will always resolve on each computer into the exact same result. And hopefully it\u0027s an intuitive result, and that\u0027s where it gets a little bit tricky.\nMichael Calore: So what you\u0027re talking about is decentralization.\nGreg Barber: Exactly.\nMichael Calore: Which is a word that pops up a lot in computing these days. How does local first computing fit into the discussion around decentralization?\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah. I mean, there\u0027s a really long history to this, of course. This goes back to basically the origins of the internet, where from the start there was this open protocol, the internet. It\u0027s pretty great, heard of it?Michael Calore: Heard of it.\nGreg Barber: Everyone can participate, everyone can build things on top of it, build different technologies. And the magic of it is that unlike prior technologies, like our telephone lines, which are owned by telephone companies who regulate the use of those wires, anybody could participate, and people were really excited about this. But from the beginning there were people who thought, actually, maybe some companies should get involved and they should play a role in managing how internet traffic is moving. So this is all to say, there\u0027s a really long history to basically fighting for the decentralization of the internet. And this became particularly true as people started building applications on top of the internet, people starting basically allowing the internet to do things for us, like we could have applications to check your email or talk to other people.\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm, you describe it beautifully in the piece where you say, a lot of the tech companies have built these gorgeous gardens, and so enticed us to go into the gardens, and then they started building the walls around them.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And that\u0027s particularly true in the early 2000s with the beginning of the cloud computing revolution. It starts off with Salesforce, basically white-labeling servers to people; they could put their own branding on them and interact with their customers that way. And then you\u0027ve got Flickr, you\u0027ve got Gmail, you\u0027ve got all sorts of different applications that are based on this model of having really great software that does a lot of useful things, but then it\u0027s rooted in needing to interact with a company\u0027s servers. So as that\u0027s happening, I think the voices that have been calling for internet decentralization have been getting louder, because this does tie into a business model that, as you said, Lauren, pulls people into these walled gardens, keeps them there, and keeps their data stuck on certain servers. Some people are pushing back on that. So there are movements like the decentralized web movement, Tim Berners-Lee is a big force in that. There\u0027s the crypto-related stuff, the Web3, which is a word that I\u0027ve not used much recently. So you could think of this kind of programming, this local first, in that tradition. And in fact, its technical roots really reach back to that tradition as well, for people who are a part of earlier movements.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: So this more recent movement towards local-first computing you discovered through discussions on Hacker News, you ended up chasing down some of the folks who are involved in this. Tell us about them, and what was their motivation for starting this movement, or restarting this movement?\nGreg Barber: This has been a recurring viral subject on Hacker News, which is this website that, as I\u0027m sure, many listeners are familiar with, where a lot of engineers go and post interesting things, and they get upvoted and more people read them. And so local-first has been a big force there, Whenever something new comes out, it seems to just shoot right to the top of the page. So I actually came across this, oh gosh, I think four years ago now, it was before the pandemic. And there was what I came to think of as a manifesto posted by a group of researchers, primarily based at this private lab called Ink \u0026 Switch, led by a software engineer named Peter van Hardenberg, who was a former engineer at Heroku, which was this startup that became quite large based actually in spinning up cloud servers for people, very much at the heart of the cloud computing revolution. It was eventually purchased by Salesforce and they did some time there. And then they\u0027re working with another computer scientist named Martin Kleppmann, who is originally from Germany. He had taken a tour as well through the startups and some of the big companies, like LinkedIn, but he came out really interested in exploring these old ideas in peer-to-peer software, and among them was a concept called CRDT, or conflict-free replicating data type.Lauren Goode: Conflict-free replicating data type.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah, and when you break it down, that garbled jumble of words makes some intuitive sense. Basically it refers to a type of data structure, so ways of moving around data and organizing it in a computer program, that can be merged together in ways that are conflict-free. So that\u0027s going back to where you have many different computers and they all have a copy of the file, and they need to figure out a way to take your changes, Lauren, and my changes, and your changes, Mike, and make them all resolve into the same thing, so you want it to be conflict-free.\nMichael Calore: Without conflicts.\nGreg Barber: And you also want it to be replicated: The three of us all have this file. So that was developed primarily by a French computer scientist named Mark Shapiro. He was working in the mid-2000s, at the very height of this cloud computing revolution. He was interested primarily in collaboration software. And at the time there wasn\u0027t really great internet connectivity, so this was a pretty big problem generally in computing. He was himself a peer-to-peer advocate, but it wasn\u0027t something that the cloud had really figured out either. He had a funny moment where he was working on this, and it felt like a very niche subject. He was toiling away, and he was working on CRDTs and this way of merging things offline, and he was like, nobody\u0027s going to be interested in this. And then a couple weeks later he says, boom, Google Docs.\nLauren Goode: Oh, interesting.\nMichael Calore: But Google was not using CRDT?\nGreg Barber: No, no, they\u0027re still relying on Google servers. So you can go offline, you can do your thing. There\u0027s some limited capabilities for multiple people being offline, but you\u0027re going back to a Google server when you want to merge those changes, whereas in this case there\u0027s no server between the three of us.\nMichael Calore: But he probably saw that as a clear indication that the world is ready for this.\nGreg Barber: Exactly, yeah. Collaboration software is here. Google\u0027s doing it, everybody, it\u0027s 2006 or 2007, people love Google and are very excited with every new Google product that\u0027s coming out.\nMichael Calore: Let us not forget about Zoho and Zoho Office also at the same time.\nGreg Barber: Oh, I\u0027m not familiar.\nMichael Calore: Oh, they do the same thing, they make an office suite collaborative.\nGreg Barber: Got it. So yeah, basically he develops this, and people aren\u0027t all that interested. The cloud computing people are like, eh, that\u0027s not particularly useful for our purposes, because we want our servers anyway. And then it\u0027s forgotten for a while, but then Martin picks it up. He\u0027d been through the startup grind, and he\u0027s now working as a research scholar at the University of Cambridge. It\u0027s in the mid-2010s, and he starts looking at this algorithm and thinks it\u0027s really interesting. How do you actually do these kind of complicated merges? But he realizes as well that it\u0027s not particularly useful to engineers like himself; it\u0027s just too inefficient. It\u0027s not integrated in any way with all the different tools that have grown up around cloud computing. So he sets about trying to implement it himself.  He wants to code out this algorithm in a way that people can actually use and start building apps.Michael Calore: All right, well let\u0027s take a break, and we\u0027ll come right back with some more.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: Greg, something you note in your story is that all of these applications that are out there now that are being demoed, they\u0027re all pretty young. They don\u0027t have a lot of the features that we would expect from mature cloud-based apps, especially the ones that they\u0027re competing with. So there\u0027s an artisanal feel to a lot of them. It must be hard to live your life the way that you are currently living it using these apps with all of their limitations, and I feel like doing so probably requires a level of patience and dedication that most people don\u0027t have.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, definitely. And this is a problem that\u0027s been dogging peer-to-peer software as long as it\u0027s been around. Mark Shapiro, the researcher who came up with CRDTs, I asked him at one point, what does your life look like online as a peer-to-peer hardliner, as he puts it? And he\u0027s like, “Well, basically I avoid the internet.”\nLauren Goode: He avoids the internet as we know it, because everything he does is peer-to-peer?\nGreg Barber: So basically there aren\u0027t alternatives available to him. He would like to be out with his friends using a bunch of peer-to-peer software, but everyone else got tired of it, and he would basically be alone if he were trying to communicate peer-to-peer with people online. Nothing really took off, and I think it\u0027s right, as you say, Mike, that it typically does involve trade-offs. It involves more user difficulty, and you lose features. I mean, the cloud is just super, super useful. , Of course there are these business models that favor the cloud, but at the core of it, cloud computing is just a very useful technology.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, it\u0027s 20 years old and has hundreds of billions of dollars thrown behind it.\nGreg Barber: Exactly, yeah, yeah. It\u0027s at the root of almost all software that we\u0027re using on a daily basis now. So that\u0027s part of it, that the technology is just very new and it\u0027s hard to build apps still on top of this. But then they really hope that, down the line, because there\u0027s this solid theoretical foundation for how to make these apps efficient and keep the servers out of the equation, that actually you can build interesting software that maybe goes beyond some of the capabilities of the kinds of applications we use every day. One example:  Kleppmann has recently been working on a prototype of an app that\u0027s for rich text editing. So it\u0027s basically Google Docs. But his idea for it is that it would be closer to something like Git, the software that computer programmers use to share their code. In that case there\u0027s this idea of pushing and pulling changes and—\nMichael Calore: Checking things in, checking things out.Greg Barber: Yeah, yeah, and there\u0027s version controls; you can see the various versions that people are trying to add to the common code base. And as a computer programmer, he finds that very useful. He thinks that if you can see all these different versions and you can spend a lot of time offline doing your own thing, and then you bring it back, that that\u0027s actually a richer program than Google Docs, which is just relying on us tinkering with the same copy, essentially.\nLauren Goode: I have a couple of questions that might be annoyingly pragmatic. So the first is that a major part of having a robust optimized cloud experience is having lots of engineers who are constantly working on maintaining and approving the infrastructure, and big tech companies tend to have the resources to hire those engineers. So in Kleppmann\u0027s vision, who are the people who are ultimately maintaining these peer-to-peer local-first computing services? And my second question is, all right, so how is this new version of the cloud going to be monetized? Because we know that\u0027s coming.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yep. Yeah, so to answer—\nLauren Goode: Senator, we sell ads.\nGreg Barber: Yes. So to answer your first question, I think they\u0027re really hoping that they can peel people away from the existing dominant cloud computing world. And it was interesting speaking with these folks during and after the big boom in cryptocurrency; there was this moment … So I should say they\u0027re not big fans of cryptocurrency themselves, despite there being some overlap in terms of the terminology around decentralization, and things like that.\nLauren Goode: Oh, interesting. Why is that?\nGreg Barber: I think two aspects: One is that just technologically it\u0027s actually in some ways the opposite. Because while local-first is meant to be offline, cryptocurrency relies on a blockchain, so you\u0027re always tethered to the technology.\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm, and it\u0027s very energy-intensive.\nGreg Barber: Mm-hmm, yeah, and controlled in this monopolistic way by whoever has the most cryptocurrency in the network, or the most computing power. And we\u0027ll get back to the money, but I think that they find crypto in general to be money-motivated. It\u0027s not necessarily for the improvement of software, it\u0027s more about, OK, how can you monetize the cryptocurrency that\u0027s flowing around the network? The apps are kind of secondary. But it did offer this interesting lesson for the local-first folks in terms of, how do you peel away those engineers from the cloud computing firms? And I think it showed that people are really interested in these principles of decentralization and data ownership and the kinds of things that are enabled if you\u0027re not worrying about cloud computing anymore. So that was heartening, and it also showed the way of, OK, how do you generate a little bit of hype around this? And I think even, something I talked about in the piece is that even the phrase local-first software is itself sort of a marketing term, it\u0027s a way of projecting values. And the viral hacker news post, this is all part of building some kind of movement where this is interesting, it\u0027s technically interesting, but it\u0027s also philosophically interesting and something that you want to join.Michael Calore: It\u0027s antiestablishment, it\u0027s altruistic.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s farm to table.\nMichael Calore: It\u0027s farm to table, it\u0027s more pure.\nGreg Barber: Yeah. But then I think that speaks to your second question, which is that those things can often conflict with making money, and that we still have this dominant paradigm of, you go to a venture capital firm, you get a bunch of money, and then they want their money back times whatever magnitude—\nMichael Calore: How dare they.\nGreg Barber: … in a few years. And one could say, “How dare they,” in terms of the scale, the scale of the monetization that\u0027s required. So that is a tension for them, and it\u0027s honestly one that, if I\u0027m being totally honest with you guys, I didn\u0027t feel was fully answered in the reporting. I think part of that can be excused because it is early, and Kleppmann and Peter van Hardenberg, they\u0027re still in a position where they\u0027re working on implementing CRDTs, and they\u0027re getting voluntary contributions from companies that are interested in local-first, and things like that, but they\u0027re not seeking venture capital funding themselves. But at the same time, I think they recognize that somebody\u0027s going to have to do it. And there is this question of, OK, are the technical underpinnings of this enough to prevent people from reaching immediately for these traditional business models? Can you let the technology lead in terms of, it\u0027s pointing to this future where you don\u0027t hoard people\u0027s data, will people rely on that technology to make in what their opinion would be the right choices around monetization? That\u0027s it too, I think that their main argument is that they\u0027re going to make really good software, it\u0027s going to be more useful than Google Docs, it\u0027s going to recruit users and stand for itself. And I think that\u0027s the big open question: Do people go for the old conveniences, or do they get inspired to pick up something new that might be truly more interesting and more useful than what came before it?\nMichael Calore: I do love the vision of the better internet. I mean, we\u0027re not talking about going back to banging rocks together and rubbing sticks together to start fires, we\u0027re talking about using these great technologies to just build something that is better and maybe more private and more secure and more friendly to our human existence.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Calore: These giant libraries where everything about us is stored and used against us.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah, and that\u0027s definitely true. And something that I haven\u0027t mentioned is it does enable certain things that the cloud doesn\u0027t, for example, end-to-end encryption, where if you\u0027re not relying on a server between you and me, then it\u0027s substantially easier in some ways to avoid prying eyes on our data. Again, the general public … in some ways end-to-end encryption, it should be a general use case, but it can be a little bit niche too. I don\u0027t know if it reels people in in the way that you might hope.Michael Calore: This is why everybody\u0027s flocking to Signal.\nGreg Barber: Exactly, yeah.\nMichael Calore: Sorry, not to throw shade at Signal, but yeah, end-to-end …\nLauren Goode: No, we\u0027re all on Signal. If anyone has any tips, get in touch with us.\nMichael Calore: Please. But end-to-end decryption is not a really big selling point for the general populace, it\u0027s a selling point for nerds like us.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah. And perhaps in a suite of other additional great things that can come out of this, it\u0027s another selling point.\nMichael Calore: All right, Greg, this has been fascinating. Thanks for coming on the show and talking all about your new feature about local-first computing that everybody can read on WIRED this week.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, thanks for having me.\nLauren Goode: And in studio too, it\u0027s a local-first Greg Barber.\nMichael Calore: It really is, this has been a fully peer-to-peer discussion.\nLauren Goode: But stick around for recommendations.\nMichael Calore: We\u0027ll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right, welcome back. Here\u0027s the last section of our show, where we all go around the table and we offer our recommendations for things that listeners might be interested in enjoying. Greg, what is your recommendation?\nGreg Barber: I\u0027d like to recommend in exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art right now that\u0027s called The Visitors. It\u0027s by an Icelandic artist, musician, whose name I\u0027m going to butcher, I\u0027m very sorry, but it\u0027s Ragnar Kjartansson. I had it pulled up on my laptop. So I went last weekend, and it\u0027s basically, you go into a room and there\u0027s a whole bunch of screens around you, and each screen is a portal into a different room in a giant house in upstate New York where Ragnar, I\u0027m going to go with his first name, he traveled with his friends and fellow musicians, and they basically recorded a enormous jam session between all of them. But they\u0027re each in their own room, they each have a single mic, a single camera. And just this amazing thing unfolds where you just watch this individual process of music making that\u0027s somehow happening through the walls and through the floors of this house, and—\nMichael Calore: Could they hear each other? Did they have monitoring?\nGreg Barber: Yeah, they can hear each other. But it\u0027s an hour long, I stayed for the full hour. I was very lucky to arrive when it started. I can\u0027t help but see some local-first allegories in it, which honestly only occurred to me just now. Yeah, I would really recommend it. It\u0027s also often in New York; it\u0027s shared between New York MoMA and SFMOMA and trades between the two.\nMichael Calore: So if you happen to live in the culturally inferior museum town of New York, then you can still see this thing that we lucky ones here in San Francisco get to see.Greg Barber: Yeah, it\u0027ll come back to you eventually.\nLauren Goode: Always throwing shade at New York City.\nMichael Calore: Well, that was sarcastic.\nLauren Goode: Oh, OK.\nMichael Calore: Because it seems like there\u0027s a museum on every corner in New York.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nMichael Calore: Or so I\u0027m told, I\u0027ve never been. That\u0027s a good one, it\u0027s a good recommendation. Thank you.\nLauren Goode: Have you ever heard of something called The Met?\nMichael Calore: The Met.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, if you work for Condé Nast you have to know what The Met is.\nMichael Calore: Is that like meta?\nLauren Goode: No, oh my goodness.\nMichael Calore: Like Facebook?\nLauren Goode: Let\u0027s move on please.\nMichael Calore: Lauren, what\u0027s your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation, I wish it was more clever or unique, like Greg\u0027s recommendation, or even local. It\u0027s not. I have finally completed my Barbenheimer quest. I went to go see Barbie, I did not see it back to back with Oppenheimer. We saw Oppenheimer together, Mike, a few weeks ago, I saw Barbie last week. And if you have not had the chance to see it yet and you\u0027re on the fence about it, I recommend it for the experience. I\u0027m going to say something that if stripped out of context would sound like a dig, I fell asleep during Barbie, but I have good reason for that. One, I was tired, so that\u0027s always a good reason to take a nap. Two, I went with a friend who wanted to go to the 10:50 showing. This is Kara Swisher, by the way. She\u0027s often known as the most feared technology journalist out there, and you should just fear her in general. She\u0027s a person who wants to go to movies at 10:50 at night, and then we\u0027ll still go home afterwards and call the cable company and yell at them and rearrange her furniture, while she\u0027s probably, I don\u0027t know, yelling at Bob Iger too. So she wanted to go to a 10:50 showing, we compromised, I said, \"No, I cannot stay up that late,\" we compromised, we went to an 8:50 showing. Still I was very tired, and the chairs were very comfortable. I saw probably two thirds of Barbie, so I feel like I got the gist, and I woke up just in time for the ending, so I saw how it concluded. I really enjoyed it, the parts that I was awake for.\nMichael Calore: You were Kentertained?\nLauren Goode: I was Kentertained, and I\u0027m glad I gave Greta Gerwig my money. I think it\u0027s an incredible feat that she made this film, I found parts of it to be really humorous and touching. I thought that Ken\u0027s discovery of the patriarchy was honestly one of the funniest darkly funny parts of the film. I also really loved Kate McKinnon\u0027s character, and Margot Robbie, as we all know, is a star. And yeah, I just think it touched on some really important themes around feminism and the patriarchy, and put it all in a Pepto-Bismol pink wrapper that made it go down really easy.Michael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, that\u0027s my recommendation, go see Barbie. Or at least, if you\u0027re not going to go see in the theaters, then see it on demand.\nMichael Calore: And take a nap.\nLauren Goode: And take a nap.\nMichael Calore: If you\u0027re tired.\nLauren Goode: If you\u0027re tired from fighting the patriarchy, you\u0027re going to need a nap. OK, Mike, what\u0027s your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: I\u0027m going to recommend a podcast, a particular episode of a podcast that I\u0027ve recommended in whole before a few years ago. It\u0027s called The War on Cars, and it\u0027s a podcast about safe streets advocacy. They talk about cycling, they talk about pedestrian issues, they talk about the difficulty that we have, particularly in North America, of breaking the car dominant culture, and the problem that so many people live far away from places that they need a car to get to, and we have not solved that for them. So the podcast in general is very good. This new episode is an interview with Bob Sorokanich, who was the editor-in-chief of Jalopnik, and before that was a high up editor, like a masthead level editor at a very large car magazine that is well known. And Bob and the hosts of this show are basically in opposition on many things car, but they manage to have a really, really interesting conversation about why we are where we are with cars. Why SUVs have dominated the market, why cars just keep getting bigger, what\u0027s the problem with EVs? Why can\u0027t we adopt EVs fast enough? Where does all the marketing money go? Why do people spend so much marketing money to sell cars to people who don\u0027t necessarily need them? It\u0027s really fascinating. It\u0027s an hour, I think it\u0027s a Patreon episode that they liked so much that they released into their feed during their current vacation that they\u0027re on, they\u0027re on summer vacation right now. So I would recommend, if you have any interest in automotive journalism or in the car industry and how it works and behind the scenes stuff, you got to check it out, it\u0027s really great.\nLauren Goode: Sounds fascinating.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, yeah.\nLauren Goode: Also, the way you said that they don\u0027t always agree on car made me think about Ken, because Ken beaches, that\u0027s what he does.\nMichael Calore: Oh, he beaches.\nLauren Goode: They use the word beach as a verb in Barbie.\nMichael Calore: I love that.\nLauren Goode: So it just made me think, they car on the podcast, that\u0027s how they do it.\nMichael Calore: I love that.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it\u0027s pretty good. Can we just take a moment, by the way, to read aloud a little note from a loyal fan?\nMichael Calore: Oh, sure.\nLauren Goode: So at the end of last week\u0027s show we mentioned that someone had written an and said something unkind, but also grammatically incorrect, which we had to flag, as journalism and English majors. So following last week\u0027s episode we got a lovely note from someone on Apple Podcasts named Yilish. Yilish, we don\u0027t know who you are, but we appreciate this. They said it was a great show, been listening to the show for about two years, thank you for your loyal listenership. \"Just listened to the future of Hollywood episode and I felt compelled to leave a review saying that all of the journalism majors and non-journalism majors at WIRED are people who do know things about tech!\" We appreciate you, we love hearing your thoughts, all of you, so please leave us a review.Michael Calore: That\u0027s great.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: And I feel like this is a great episode to read it on, because what other podcasts this week are you going to hear a mention of CRDTs and End-to-End encryption?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I mean, we love this stuff. We\u0027re skeptical, sometimes, but we love it, that\u0027s why we do what we do here at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: Oh, Greg, thanks so much for being here this week.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, thanks for having me.\nLauren Goode: So great to have you here, Greg.\nMichael Calore: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on the social medias, just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth, we will be back next week, and until then, goodbye.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]\nLauren Goode: Goodbye. Oh, I don\u0027t really like my recommendation, that\u0027s why I\u0027m kind of like-\nMichael Calore: I think it\u0027s a great recommendation.\nLauren Goode: All right, it\u0027s yeah, I\u0027ll just-\nMichael Calore: I want to hear what you have to say about Barbie.\nLauren Goode: OK.\nMichael Calore: I\u0027m ...

Archival audioclip (Back to the Future): I\u0027m from the future.\nLauren Goode: Alright, I\u0027m gonna ask the question that everyone\u0027s wondering about: What is a futurist? Is this a real job?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, I mean, I think some people imagine it\u0027s just, you know, a guy who sits around making predictions about the future, and there are probably some people who do just that. But Noah calls himself an applied futurist, by which he means that he studies trends—technological, economic, demographic, political, you name it. And then he works within institutions like the government to help them take those trends into account in their decisionmaking and their policies. So how should they think about the impact of AI, for instance?\nNoah Raford (audioclip): I was having a conversation with a Ghanaian friend recently, and the potential for AI and all the tools which represent in that kinda larger space has for basically dysfunctional failed states and second-order semi-functional states, which is most of the world in some argument, is absolutely huge.\nLauren Goode: All right, so he sounds pretty positive on AI, but we don\u0027t actually know how that\u0027s going to shake out yet. I\u0027m wondering if you two talked about things he has predicted accurately in the past or some things he got right.\nGideon Lichfield: I mean, he made a pretty good call on Covid.\nNoah Raford (audioclip): Called that early. I stopped going into work two months before it became a commonly accepted thing. When I had to go into work, I was wearing masks and everyone was yelling at me like, you\u0027re freaking people out. Why are you doing this?\nGideon Lichfield: And of course we talked about climate change. \nNoah Raford (audioclip): We still labor under the belief that we can stop climate change, and that\u0027s just not true.\nLauren Goode: Huh. That\u0027s pretty jarring to hear. What are we supposed to do with that kind of information?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, I think there was this undercurrent to the conversation with Noah, which was that being a futurist is not just about predicting the future or even about working with governments or other institutions to capitalize on it, but it\u0027s about being ready for it emotionally. Noah\u0027s kind of like a future therapist.\nArchival audioclip (2001: A Space Odyssey): I can see you are really upset about this. You ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.\nLauren Goode: Well, therapy typically leaves me feeling a little drained and like maybe I need three days to process whatever was discussed. So I look forward to hearing your conversation with Noah and then maybe you and I can cry together afterward. \nGideon Lichfield: Yeah, I mean, we may cry, but I think you\u0027ll feel somewhat uplifted because even though he says some really alarming things, uh, I think Noah takes the premise of the show and kind of flips it on its head. For him, the question isn\u0027t “Is this the future we want?” It\u0027s more, how do we get ready for the future that\u0027s coming both technically and emotionally. That conversation with Noah Raford is after the break.[Break]\nGideon Lichfield: Noah, thanks for joining me on Have a Nice Future. Are you having a nice future? \nNoah Raford: I\u0027m having a great future.\nGideon Lichfield: Well, I would kind of expect a futurist to be having a great future. But this future that’s coming—it\u0027s climate change, it\u0027s AI, it\u0027s floundering democracies, and as you readily admit, it\u0027s pretty scary. So how do we prepare for that? \nNoah Raford: Yeah, there\u0027s a cognitive fallacy which I like to use called the future logical materialism trap, and it comes from an old book on Buddhism called Spiritual Materialism, the idea that if you just meditate enough, you\u0027re gonna achieve enlightenment and that enlightenment is an escape from suffering. And if you dig deeply into Buddhism and spiritual traditions, it\u0027s not the case. You can\u0027t … Enlightenment is not the alleviation of suffering, nor is analysis the alleviation of uncertainty about the future. The future logical materialism fallacy states that there is a certain amount of data which you can analyze and that if you just think about the right thing, if you pay attention to the right thing, you won\u0027t get surprised or you\u0027ll find the advantage. And that\u0027s an illusion, that\u0027s a trap, because there is no right thing. Everything is falling apart at once. Everything is changing simultaneously. And there\u0027s no amount of data you can analyze, there\u0027s no amount of trends which you can research or time which you can spend to actually discover what\u0027s gonna really happen in the future. You just end up stressing yourself out and missing the real changes which are happening around you \u0027cause you don\u0027t know what to prioritize and you spend all your time in this analysis paralysis.\nGideon Lichfield: I see. That\u0027s a lovely parallel. I like that a lot. And I think it\u0027s kind of reassuring …\nNoah Raford: It is.\nGideon Lichfield: … to understand that we can spend time thinking and we don\u0027t have to find the answer. That doesn\u0027t mean that we\u0027ve done a bad job.\nNoah Raford: That\u0027s precisely right. And then that opens to the question of, well, what can you do? If it\u0027s not a question of data collection and of analysis, then what is the right response to have here? What is a healthy emotional response to the terror of the future and the excitement of the opportunities presented to us? And really that gets down to something which has nothing to do with analysis or even thinking. That\u0027s much more of an emotional response to the actions which we\u0027re able to take in our lives, be they large or small. And a funny application of this is when it comes to climate change. Objectively, it is materially irrelevant if you recycle or not. Objectively, it is absolutely irrelevant to the course of this planet if you use plastic straws or not. It makes zero difference to the outcome of climate change. However, subjectively, that might be an action which you can take consciously, which makes you feel better about being aware of this issue and trying to gain some power over that huge terrifying issue in your life through small actions. And that\u0027s important. Because the key thing here when you face this terror of the future is for us to be able to translate that terror into excitement and opportunity is we have to feel some sense of agency, and the only way to feel agency is through action, small, medium, and large.Gideon Lichfield: So taking action is more important than whether it\u0027s the right action—the perfect action to take. The most important is to have agency and do something. What are one or two things that you think are important, pretty likely future trends that most people are not paying enough attention to—maybe one that\u0027s scary and one that\u0027s positive? \nNoah Raford: Well, my go-to answer for this historically has been climate change and AI. Thankfully, we\u0027re becoming more and more aware of the reality of climate change, but we still labor under the belief that we can stop climate change and that\u0027s just not true. We cannot. We cannot. The damage has been done. We might be able to lessen the consequences of it, but ultimately, our entire lives and certainly our children\u0027s entire lives are going to be spent dealing with the consequences of climate change. And that\u0027s going to produce dramatic, extraordinary historic shifts in all areas of our lives, which even those of us who do this on a day-to-day basis have a hard time really emotionally accepting. We\u0027re likely to see a billion-plus climate refugees in our lifetime, which is going to drive state failure, border clashes, xenophobia, racism, currency collapse, the collapse of electricity grids, food stresses, more pandemics, that\u0027s a terrifying thing to really live with. About once or twice a year, I have a conversation with my children that we\u0027re pretty lucky, but it\u0027s a pretty high likelihood that we\u0027re gonna be refugees at some point in our life.\nGideon Lichfield: That\u0027s quite a lot to set them up for.\nNoah Raford: It\u0027s quite a lot. And what\u0027s been interesting about this in terms of both parenting but how you or all of us deal with these sorts of scary, big changes over time, is when you first have that conversation, it\u0027s terrifying and you ignore it, or you deny it. And the second time, you accept a little bit more, and the third time, it\u0027s scary but you\u0027re able to sit with that fear a little bit more, and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth time … So by having this conversation every six months, over time for years and years and years, you get to this point that is normalizing an emotional experience of dramatic change and it shifts from being a terrifying life-ending horror show into something which is just like, \"Okay, yeah, if it happens, what will we do? Where would we go? How would you adapt? What might be exciting about this? Who would you wanna spend time with? Where would … \" These sorts of things. It becomes more proactive \u0027cause you\u0027re gradually taking away the terror and the emotional pain of our comfortable lives being ripped away from us and therefore preparing for a more exciting future.\nGideon Lichfield: What’s something that’s coming up that you think we should be excited by instead of terrified by? \nNoah Raford: Right. So that\u0027s the terrifying question. And again, my traditional go-to answer here has been AI, which was something which very few people outside of the field were paying attention to until about, I don\u0027t know, two months ago when GPT-3 came out.Gideon Lichfield: Okay, so now everybody knows about GPT and its variants, but you\u0027re also seeing people warning about use cases, like someone can just use it to cook up any number of recipes for toxins and how to distribute them, all sorts of possibilities for mischief that just now become much easier. So what makes you confident that it\u0027s net positive rather than negative? \nNoah Raford: The thing that excites me about that is because unlike most other emerging technologies to date, the degree of public discourse around the risks is exceedingly high. Like my father who\u0027s quite intelligent but pretty elderly at this point and not quite engaged in these issues, is forwarding the articles about OpenAI\u0027s discussion of the risks of this for misinformation and for using this for toxic chemicals and these types of things. So the degree of public awareness of this and the degree of conversation in the public realm about the risks and opportunities is really quite extraordinary. It\u0027s quite extraordinarily sophisticated. And it\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg here. We\u0027re going to see all sorts of regulatory experimentation around this soon as people struggle to deal with the copyright implications and the cross-border or jurisdictional issues of these things, and the issue of IP, if you upload a document that is under NDA or medical data to one of these services then. Who owns that? Where does that go? Have you breached HIPAA terms? All this stuff is really materially present right now and is being debated in every industry right now at a very advanced level. And that gives me hope.\nGideon Lichfield: There was this survey of 700-something AI experts that has been making the rounds, that asked them if they thought that, what was the likelihood basically of AI leading to human extinction or serious human incapacitation of the human race as a civilization—words to that effect—and 50 percent of these experts said they thought there was a more than 10 percent chance. Isn\u0027t that a pretty scary number? \nNoah Raford: I think it is pretty scary, but also I think that\u0027s a pretty honest assessment of the existential risks which we face, not just with AI, but really in terms of climate, in terms of nuclear exchange, in terms of additional pandemics, in terms of the total collapse of the financial system. I think that part of being future savvy in today\u0027s world is looking clear-eyed at the real terrible potentials of these technologies and not just turning your back on them like a bad parent who doesn\u0027t wanna have anything to do with the world their children is living in, but actually really engaging in these questions. Now, is 10 percent too high? Does that mean we shouldn\u0027t try to explore the implications and benefits of this? I would argue, no. \nGideon Lichfield: Does it mean though we should slow down the deployment of it, maybe? \nNoah Raford: Is that even possible? Gideon Lichfield: That\u0027s a fair question, but it certainly makes the case that I think that you\u0027re making, which is that we should be talking about this a hell of a lot more.\nNoah Raford: Absolutely. That\u0027s my fundamental point when it comes to AI. The thing that is encouraging about that is that unlike greenhouse gases or cigarettes, or the dangers of vaping, or the dangers of automobile reliance, or obesity, or diabetes, these chronic conditions, unlike so many of these other large social issues, there is a pretty robust conversation going on around AI because it has exploded into everyone\u0027s lives in such a public way that people can experience on a day-to-day personal basis. And I think that\u0027s at least the beginning of an exciting conversation around this. And that coupled with the extraordinary potential which this offers is fundamentally exciting because one way or another, we\u0027re going to have a forcing moment in the next decade or so between climate, economic failure, state collapse, large-scale populist movements and even potentially revolution, and the absolute destruction of much of the labor force by AI is gonna force us to fundamentally reevaluate what we mean for us as a society. What does economy mean? What does society mean? What is the world that we actually wanna build in here? And that conversation is gonna probably be violent. It\u0027s probably gonna be uncomfortable. It\u0027s gonna have different forms in different countries. But it\u0027s going to become the genesis of what the next couple of versions or iterations of human society look like through a decade or two of experimentation and discord and strife. And that\u0027s freaking exciting because the world is falling apart and we need to start building a new world.\nGideon Lichfield: I can\u0027t wait. And I\u0027m also thinking of the privilege that people like you and I have to be the ones who can lead and convene and take part in that conversation instead of just being washed back and forth by the consequences of it.\nNoah Raford: Absolutely, but one of the things that … Obviously, we\u0027re extraordinarily privileged to be able to think about these things and talk about these things, but one of the things that encourages me—and I still live in Dubai, and Dubai is the crossroads of human civilization—there are more expats who weren\u0027t born in the UAE living in Dubai than any other city in the world. And you have these conversations in coffee shops, at the market, in your office with so many different people and people from all walks of life are engaging with this. And I\u0027ll tell you the people who I\u0027ve found who are most excited by this are people coming from developing contexts. This is South Asia, this is East Asia, this is North Africa. Why? Because these are the people who have historically been screwed out of benefits of the 20th-century globalized project. They\u0027ve been the one on the receiving end of the extractive mechanism. And now suddenly, at least for the moment, there\u0027s the glimmer of hope, the possibility that that system is falling apart, cracks in the world order are emerging, and we have at our fingertips these extraordinarily generative tools to try to build new businesses and build new companies and societies and new ways of doing things. And people are excited. Talk to an 18-year-old—Gideon Lichfield: That\u0027s so interesting that they are seeing the opportunity and the excitement in this. That kind of gives me hope as well.\nNoah Raford: Absolutely. Talk to a 14-year-old Indian kid about this in Bangalore, they are losing their mind with the potential for this. It\u0027s incredible. Talk to … I was having a conversation with a Ghanaian friend recently, and the potential for AI and all the tools which represent that kinda larger space has for basically dysfunctional failed states and second-order semi-functional states, which is most of the world in some argument, is absolutely huge. And so really, there shouldn\u0027t be a sort of sense of privilege guilt around talking about this stuff \u0027cause we\u0027re not the only ones talking about it. And in fact, we\u0027re probably the ones who are most modestly using this. There\u0027s a lot of weird experiments going on in the shadows that are gonna define what tomorrow looks like.\nGideon Lichfield: So Dubai has been home for you for …\nNoah Raford: That\u0027s 13, 14 years.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. And you spent a lot of that period working as the chief futurist for the government of Dubai. And Dubai is a place that makes some people in the West kind of uncomfortable. It\u0027s not a democratic government. It\u0027s kind of not an egalitarian place, very advanced in things like surveillance tech. Why did you spend so long there and what did you learn from it? What is … Why is Dubai so important to you? \nNoah Raford: It\u0027s such a good question, \u0027cause Dubai is one of those things which means so many different things to so many different people, depending on the eyes through which you look at it. And I think that it\u0027s quite typical, certainly, if you\u0027ve never been there, if you just read about it in the press, particularly if you grew up in the West, Western Europe, UK, France, the United States, that you get a particularly filtered version of this. When I first moved there, working in the prime minister\u0027s office, the thing that was just so profoundly shocking and surprising and invigorating to me was that it was, like I say, it was globalization with the wool pulled off your eyes. It was this huge transit hub of ideas, of people, of attitudes, of beliefs, of goods, of services from literally almost every country in the world living together, working together, trading together, without the pretense and the intermediation that we normally experience each other through. Most of us don\u0027t spend a lot of time in India or China, or North Africa, or Russia, or Ukraine, or even other states in America. And so in that sense, it gives you this extraordinary vantage point to see how … Literally, I\u0027ll give you an example, one of the things which I gained a tiny degree of notoriety for in my job was like I predicted Covid early. And it\u0027s not because I\u0027m really smart or I had some vast surveillance apparatus around me or something of that nature. It\u0027s because I live in Dubai and there\u0027s two-thirds of the world\u0027s population within an eight-hour flight there, and almost all economic activity in the region comes through Dubai. I have lots of friends in Singapore. I have lots of friends in China. I have lots of friends in India. And I\u0027m in touch with them on a relatively frequent basis. So when things started unfolding in Wuhan and in China with Covid in end of December, beginning of January, it didn\u0027t take a genius to figure out how many flights a day are there between China and the UAE, and to think that this is something which could really break.Gideon Lichfield: Right, and that\u0027s something that you could just see from where you sat, basically.\nNoah Raford: Precisely. Precisely. And so I think that\u0027s what so extraordinary about Dubai is it really is a city of the future in the sense that because it is the epicenter of all of these different threads of human civilization and of economy and politics and ideology and belief and culture, everything is kind of there.\nGideon Lichfield: Do you think … Would you argue that Dubai is actually doing a better job of developing this technology in a way that is attentive to ethics and to social needs? \nNoah Raford: Yeah, absolutely, I absolutely would. I think there\u0027s a dozen examples. We could take cryptocurrency and blockchain as an example. Early on, we started working in that space in 2014. We created an industry in a civil society group called the Dubai Global Blockchain Council in 2014 that had all the big banks, all the big regulators, all the big tech companies, a bunch of the most interesting startups at the time, as well as a bunch of academics and entrepreneurs in it. And what do we do? We just first started talking about it. \"What do we mean by this? What is this thing?\" This was a big collaborative civil society effort and we did a bunch of public events, started having conversations in the media about it, building a dialogue around this in the public sphere. And then after kind of coming up with some understanding of what the risks and the opportunities were, each of the people in the organization and the industry association started to do experiments and prototypes, proof of concepts, \"What does it mean for a bank? What does it mean for a logistics company? What does it mean for a car company? What does it mean for education certification and degrees, and for the health care authority?\" And by doing these little experiments, we\u0027re able to do several things at once, which was first remove the emotional terror from the novelty of this new way of doing things, which is the biggest barrier to change, and second, provide strong coalitions of people who supported it in the industry, who had skin in the game and who are willing to test it out, that led to not only the legalization of crypto in 2016, but also a very ambitious strategy to implement cryptocurrency technologies in all of the public sector applications. And I think that\u0027s a … I think what … The US is still arguing over how to regulate this stuff.\nGideon Lichfield: What\u0027s been your best call and your worst call about the future? \nNoah Raford: I think Covid was a great call. Called that early. I stopped going to work two months before it became a commonly accepted thing. When I had to go into work, I was wearing masks and everyone was yelling at me like, \"You\u0027re freaking people out. Why are you doing this? [chuckle] Stop this. Our staff is getting scared. We don\u0027t have an official statement out yet.\" But I said, \"No, this is a big deal, this is coming.\" And in fact, my Covid escape story was like a scene from the movie Children of Men. I escaped Dubai two days before the border closed. I arrived in the UK to pick up my kids and family, managed to convince them in a 48-hour period that this was a really big deal. We rented a car, drove through the channel to France two hours before the borders closed, found a place to stay two hours before the national lockdown in France occurred and spent four months in an organic pig farm in Provence, and it was awesome.Gideon Lichfield: That\u0027s sounds like a good call.\nNoah Raford: It was awesome. So that was definitely probably my shining moment as an applied futurist there.\nGideon Lichfield: And as a father.\nNoah Raford: And as a father, yeah. So that was the moment where all those years of conversation of like, \"We might be refugees, guys. Things might change in really surprising and traumatic ways really fast.\" All that stuff paid off.\nGideon Lichfield: And what was your worst call? \nNoah Raford: What was my worst call? I\u0027d have to say self-driving cars.\nGideon Lichfield: What did you say about them? \nNoah Raford: Well, I was big on … I was big on autonomous transport quite early, part of my background as an urban planner. And I took one of the first delegations of all senior Dubai government officials to San Francisco back in 2014 or so, 2014, \u002715. We visited Google X before it was Waymo, and a lot of these self-driving car companies then. And it looked to me that the development curve of AI and computer vision and autonomy was gonna yield pretty dramatic changes in the mobility space over the next five, 10 years. And when you\u0027re talking about road-building programs, that means you have to start changing the way you\u0027re doing things now. So, we went really big on self-driving cars and autonomous transport and developed a big autonomous transport strategy, and just the industry hasn\u0027t really gotten there.\nGideon Lichfield: What keeps you up at night? \nNoah Raford: Well, we certainly have not seen the last pandemic, that\u0027s for sure. I was reading a study the other day by Development Institute. They were estimating something like a 25 percent chance of another corona-scale pandemic within the next 10 years and a 50 percent chance within the next 20 years. That\u0027s just one of those things that is so far beyond our control that we have really not prepared for, that would really, really ruin a lot of people\u0027s days. So I\u0027m really worried about that. I\u0027m still worried about uncontrolled nuclear releases, I\u0027m really worried … Actually, speaking about the pandemic thing, I\u0027m really worried, a lot of the evidence I\u0027m seeing coming out of the Siberian Tundra that\u0027s thawing, there\u0027s all sorts of unbelievably nasty viruses from 15,000 years ago, like new strains of anthrax and stuff which have been lying dormant in the Siberian Tundra, which are just gonna get released over the next decade or two. And we have—\nGideon Lichfield: You started talking about the tundra and I thought you\u0027re gonna say methane.\nNoah Raford: I wish. I wish methane was … Methane\u0027s a long, slow problem for us. But we are likely to face some emerging infectious disease or virus coming out of melted tundra in Siberia sooner rather than later, and we have no idea what that looks like. And all the biologists which I\u0027ve been reading around the space are pretty freaking terrified about it.Gideon Lichfield: Okay. And then finally, what gives you cause for optimism? \nNoah Raford: I mean, it\u0027s exciting, right? It\u0027s exciting. I just started my own company, an AI company, which is super exciting to be able to have really the power of billions of dollars of computational data analysis in your hands for pennies, and to be able to build niche services around that, build really valuable companies around little niches that serve a specific audience really, really well. It\u0027s so exciting. There\u0027s so many life-changing amounts of money and life-changing businesses that are going to be made in the next two, three years around AI by itself, that it should give people hope. It should give people some immediate day-to-day sense of encouragement and enthusiasm that we can actually do something that is definitely gonna change our lives and our family\u0027s lives, if not \"save the world.\" But as a whole, so many people are experimenting in these spaces, be it from biotech to new financial services, to new applications of AI, that it\u0027s just deeply exciting.\nGideon Lichfield: Noah, you are one of the people that I know that most lives in the future. And I\u0027m gonna sign off by telling you to have a nice future because I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027re gonna have one.\nNoah Raford: Let\u0027s have a nice future together.\nGideon Lichfield: Thank you, Noah.\nNoah Raford: Thanks, Gideon.\n[Break]\nGideon Lichfield: So, how did that make you feel, Lauren? \nLauren Goode: Well, let me just say, I would love to be a fly on the wall during one of Noah Raford\u0027s dinner conversations with his kids.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, the ones where he says, \"You\u0027re gonna be refugees.\"\nLauren Goode: Yes, every six months or so, just call for the family meeting and say, \"Kids, we\u0027re preparing for the worst.\" I can\u0027t tell whether that instills unnecessary fear in future generations, or whether that\u0027s actually the smart thing to do. It seems like it\u0027s a pretty smart thing to do.\nGideon Lichfield: Seems like it\u0027s a smart thing to do to me. I mean, we\u0027re afraid of... We can\u0027t imagine conversations like that because we\u0027re precisely afraid of that possibility. Can you imagine becoming a refugee? But people have grown up in all sorts of different times of history with all kinds of different expectations about what the future is, or even the concept of the future. So, I feel like if you get people used to the fact that it\u0027s going to look or could look a certain way, then maybe it\u0027s a lot less traumatic when it finally happens.\nLauren Goode: Right. And it made me think also based on what he said about pandemics, that maybe we should be having those conversations once every three to six months among ourselves to say, \"How are we going to handle it if or when the next pandemic happens?\"Gideon Lichfield: Right. It\u0027s almost like being preppers in the US, people who are just expecting the worst and are ready for it to happen. It\u0027s easy to laugh at them, but then there is something about that feeling of being … Feeling ready, feeling secure, that even if the worst happens, you can handle it. I think that might be psychologically helpful to a lot of people, especially in the world we\u0027re going into.\nLauren Goode: The second thing that came to mind was, I wasn\u0027t sure what to make of his approach to thinking about climate change and I wanted to hear your thoughts on this. Because on the one hand, he\u0027s saying we should do small things in order to feel a sense of agency, but on the other hand, he basically says that what we do does not matter. We could recycle all the stuff we\u0027re supposed to recycle, we could bike to work as I\u0027ve started doing and it just doesn\u0027t matter. That was a little bit depressing to hear because this recent IPCC report makes it clear just how dire things are and that we really need swift, wide-scale reduction in the use of fossil fuels if we\u0027re going to avoid reaching catastrophic global temperatures. And yet, Noah is saying it doesn\u0027t matter. Everything we do doesn\u0027t matter.\nGideon Lichfield: I mean, I think …\nLauren Goode: How did you square this? \nGideon Lichfield: I think … The way I took it was he was saying, yes, individual actions like biking to work one day or recycling this bottle are not going to make a difference, but I think if we are doing these things, taking responsibility for the way our actions might impact the climate, then two things happen: One, you get a sense of agency that I think is just a good for your mental well-being and two, you become part of this fabric of people who are taking these actions, thinking about these things and making the question of climate more central in their lives just by virtue of action. And I think it influences the decisions that we make around which politicians we support, or which campaigns we support, or which companies we buy from. And those decisions ultimately influence the people whose decisions do matter because those are the big policy and commercial decisions that ultimately change the course of what fuels we use or what energy gets expended.\nLauren Goode: Here\u0027s the other thing that you guys talked about that really stood out to me: AI. And I thought he really helped put this in perspective for me, because we as journalists are a little bit alarmed right now by the release of generative AI, and I think we should be, but Noah also brought up a fair point about how there may be a 14-year-old kid in another part of the world, and he mentions Bangalore specifically, that is seeing generative AI as a tool or as an opportunity, and that some of the technological developments of the past 20 years may have left large portions of the population behind and this is a chance for people to actually sort of get on … on even ground. At the same time, I\u0027m not entirely convinced that generative AI will be any different from those advancements because we\u0027re already seeing how it\u0027s being released within a sort of capitalistic structure and how we, people, are being used as inputs for the training data. What did you make of that? Gideon Lichfield: Of course, there are going to be the 14-year-olds in Bangalore who will be able to have opportunities they wouldn\u0027t have had otherwise because of generative AI. For me, there\u0027s always this quote that sticks in my mind from Zeynep Tufekci, who\u0027s a sociologist of technology, and a piece that she wrote that I commissioned, and it is, \"Power always learns and powerful tools always fall into its hands.\" And the point that she\u0027s making is the structural political economic power arrangements that exist tend to reassert themselves, and they are slower to catch up to new technologies, but they ultimately do catch up. So I am skeptical that these tools are gonna fundamentally create a more level playing field. They will give opportunities to some.\nLauren Goode: Say a little bit more about that.\nGideon Lichfield: I mean that we will see the kid from Bangalore become the leader of a multibillion-dollar company, and in fact, that\u0027s already happened with some of the top companies in the US. But those power structures that they come into are existing power structures. So is India going to overtake the US because of generative AI? No. Is India gonna overtake the US for other reasons? Possibly. But I don\u0027t think technology is the driving force here. It\u0027s demographic questions, it\u0027s economic questions, it\u0027s geopolitical questions that are driving who ultimately ends up on top.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, and especially since these generative AI tools are coming from these capitalistic enterprises, there are roots in academic research, but right now it\u0027s kind of a race among these companies, these tech companies, to just put things out into the world and best each other.\nGideon Lichfield: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: That doesn\u0027t seem to bode super well for us as humans. We\u0027re all humans, but that doesn\u0027t seem to bode super well for us as the average tech consumers.\nGideon Lichfield: One of the things that for me was interesting was how he talked about the UAE as this transit hub for people all over the world. I think a lot about the future of government and democracy, and one of the things that\u0027s clear is that the notion that I grew up with, that liberal democracy is just gonna take over the entire world, that\u0027s not going to happen. And what Noah was hinting at for me was a future in which there are many different kinds of government systems around the world and it\u0027s not necessarily … Obviously, the democracies are the ones that are best at serving their citizens or at keeping up with the pace of technological development and how to regulate it. I think he described how he felt like Dubai is much more on top of the pace of technological change and how to keep it doing the best things for its society. So I feel like that\u0027s an uncomfortable position for us in the western world because we grew up with this notion that our political system is necessarily going to yield the best results, the most equal results for everybody. And Noah got me thinking a lot about just how true or untrue that is.Lauren Goode: How hopeful did you feel walking away from your conversation with him? \nGideon Lichfield: I felt more hopeful simply because I saw from him that there is a way to think about the future that doesn\u0027t require you to feel like you have to be able to predict the future. It\u0027s more about a mindset of preparedness for it. Now, sure, I think that also comes with a certain amount of privilege that someone like Noah has, or someone like you or I have, that we\u0027re in a good position to be able to capitalize on wherever the future is going and be prepared for it. That isn\u0027t true for everyone. But at least it gave me some reassurance that you don\u0027t have to know where things are going in order to survive them.\nLauren Goode: So it\u0027s not like he told you we\u0027re going to have a nice future, but he told you we can at least be prepared for a not nice future? \nGideon Lichfield: Umm, yeah.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s our show for today. Thanks for listening. Have a Nice Future is hosted by me, Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And me, Gideon Lichfield. \nLauren Goode: If you like the show, you can leave us a review wherever you get your podcasts, and follow us to hear more episodes. \nGideon Lichfield: Have a Nice Future is a production of Condé Nast Entertainment. Danielle Hewitt and Lena Richards from Prologue Projects produce the show.\nLauren: See you back here next Wednesday.","tags":["","HAVE A NICE FUTURE","PODCASTS","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","CLIMATE CHANGE","COVID-19","CITIES","POLICY","PARENTING"],"author":"BY GIDEON LICHFIELD","creation_date":"2023-04-26"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/four-ways-to-close-the-gender-gap-in-tech-roles/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Companies Do Better When Their Teams Are Diverse. Here Are Some Strategies…","title":"Four Ways To Close The Gender Gap In Tech Roles","detailed_content":"OVER THE PAST decade, technology has changed radically. Machine learning has taken off, ‘blockchain’ has entered the lexicon, virtual reality has emerged from a winter. But one thing remains the same: a gender gap in the industry.\nIn Europe, for example, the current proportion of women in tech roles is 22 percent, McKinsey research shows. And the women who are there lag their male peers when it comes to promotions – in technical roles, only 52 women were promoted to manager for every 100 men at the same level, according to an analysis by the consultancy in 2021. That compared with 86 women for every 100 men across all job types. \n“To close the gap, we need to create environments that allow women to stay in the industry and to thrive,” says Anne-Marie Imafidon, CEO of Stemettes, a social enterprise she co-founded in 2013 to support girls, young women and non-binary people to pursue careers in science, technology and engineering. “If you do that, problems with retention and promotion will fall away.” \nStemettes is 10 years old, but Imafidon says that the young women the organisation works with are “still asking the same question: ‘Can I do this even though I can’t see anyone who looks like me?’”\nFor the technology industry, fixing the problem is not just a matter of ethics. There is also a business imperative. For one, studies show that more diverse teams tend to perform better. For another, tech companies are facing a shortage of qualified people. In the EU alone, there will be a shortfall of between 1.4 million and 3.9 million tech staff by 2027, McKinsey’s research shows. The consultancy estimates that if the share of women in tech roles could be increased to 45 percent – the equivalent of 3.9 million additional women – by the same year, the skills gap would be closed. \nClearly, working and corporate cultures need to change so that women have an equal chance of being hired and promoted in tech roles. And, of course, the talent pipeline needs to be developed by encouraging and inspiring more women to consider tech as a career in the first place. There are many aspects to the solution, and what follows is by no means an exhaustive set of options. But here are four strategies for companies to consider…\n1. Set radical diversity targets\nTech firms where women account for more than 35 percent of staff are often deemed to be doing comparatively well. In that context, a full gender diversity target is punchy – but a number of businesses are making it work. AI company Mad Street Den, a California headquartered start-up with offices in Chennai, India, New York, and Dubai, was founded on the basis that gender equality would be a defining feature. It has close to a 50/50 split among its 275 staff. \nAshwini Asokan, Mad Street Den’s founder and CEO, says the company had a clear reason for the 50/50 metric, which was “diversity of thought” that would produce better products and technology. “No entity survives when it only has one variety of thought.”Asokan says that recruitment has never been an insurmountable issue – so Mad Street Den focuses its efforts on helping women to stay with the company. Measures include 100 percent pay parity between men and women, an on-site nursery, and detailed discussions at the interview stage about the candidate’s responsibilities and support network outside work. For a period of time when a lot of staff had small babies, there was a nanny in the office.\n“Working in a start-up, the work-life balance can be brutal and you need a strong support system in place to make it work,” says Asokan. “But it’s not an either/or situation – it’s not the case that just because you’re a new mom, you don’t want a director’s role. If you deserve that role in the organisation, what are we going to do to ensure you are supported? How do we keep that person and support them and take care of them?” \n2. Introduce full pay transparency\nA study of senior female technologists by the US bank and credit card company Capital One found that fair and good compensation was a top driver for staying in their job. \nYet in many tech firms, there is a pay gap. One way to address this is pay transparency, and some companies are finding success in taking a particularly radical approach. Consider Buffer, which has published the salaries of all its employees online since 2013. The company, whose software tool helps companies schedule social media posts, also has a formula that sets pay for each role.\nWhile knowing exactly what all of your colleagues earn does “feel foreign” to many staff when they start, it also “broke down barriers for women”, says Jenny Terry, Buffer’s director of business operations. Full pay transparency has had the additional benefit of “really kickstarting recruitment and lifting the number of applications we had” because people knew what they would be paid, she adds.\nStill, in 2018 the company analysed its unadjusted gender pay gap – that is to say, the difference between what women and men are paid overall, not just in direct comparisons of two people doing the same job (known as an adjusted gender pay gap). This assessment showed that women in the company earned nine percent less than men, and in 2019, that figure rose to 15 percent. The reason for the gap was that Buffer had more men in technical roles, which paid better. \n“It was humbling for us because we had relied a bit too much on the formula and the transparency to say ‘we pay equitably’,” said Terry. \nThis further focussed their minds on “making sure we had highly qualified female candidates for technical roles”, she says.\nIt has paid off: Buffer has now narrowed the overall pay gap to less than one percent. The company employs 34 women and 44 men.\n3. Use AI to root out language bias\nIn workplace performance reviews, women are 22 percent more likely to get feedback about their personality than men. As part of that feedback, women are seven times more likely to be described as “opinionated”, 11 times more likely to be described as “abrasive” and 3.5 times more likely to be described as “ambitious”, according to research from Seattle-based Textio.\n“Whether the manager intended it to be positive or negative, that aspect of the feedback was not about the quality of their work or whether they achieved the deliverable in a project,” says Kieran Snyder, CEO of Textio. “The potential for harm is greater in tech organisations because you already have a gender imbalance.”Unconscious bias in language creates problems both in hiring and in retention. The wrong choice of words, however unwitting, may put women off applying for tech jobs in the first place, and performance reviews that turn into personal criticism undermine confidence and can deter employees from applying for promotions. Training is one way that companies try to address this issue – but some companies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI).\nTextio makes AI software to pick up problematic language in recruitment and feedback. Snyder says Textio’s corporate customers see a 30 percent increase in the number of women applying for roles if they use its tool when creating a job ad.\nThe question, as with all AI, is how the humans building the natural language processing tool define the problem – what is biased language? Snyder says the answer lies in having genuine diversity in the team creating the tools. Textio has an equal number of male and female employees.\n4. Intentionally build a pipeline\nA survey last year of more than 2,000 UK school and university students by PwC found that only 27 percent of female students would consider a career in technology. That compares to 61 percent of male students. \nIn addition, just 16 percent of the female students had had a career in technology suggested to them, compared with 33 percent of males. And the lack of role models was notable – only 22 percent of students could name a famous woman working in tech, whereas two-thirds could name a famous man. \nSome companies are taking a proactive approach to addressing this by building a pipeline of female talent for all levels of their organisation. \nThat can start by forging connections with grassroots groups such as Girls Who Code or Stemettes. Anne-Marie Imafidon set up Stemettes to give girls, young women and non-binary people the chance to attend workshops and join mentoring programmes with technology and engineering companies. “If you can see it, you can be it,” she says. \nImafidon also encourages companies hiring for tech roles to be more open-minded to people who may lack a traditional computer science or maths degree, but have other experience and can be trained in the technical skills they need. “It’s not just about HTML – there’s value and benefits in the technology space from a range of experiences – a trained dancer can become a virtual and mixed reality expert,” she says, as that background gives them a deep understanding of movement.\nTo build a pipeline of future leaders, organisations should also ensure that female talent within the business have opportunities to meet and learn from women at the top of their technical specialism.\nThis is something that happens in the British Army. Take Captain Catherine Henderson, who joined the Royal Corps of Signals after gaining her commission at Sandhurst in 2014. The Corps provides battlefield communications and information systems. Through its Inspiring Women in Technology networking group Henderson has had the chance to learn from senior women in both the military and the tech industry.\n“As a young woman embarking on a career in a field that people would label as male-heavy, there is a lot of inspiration to take from women who have been successful in their careers, gained the technical qualifications and done it around having a family,” says Henderson. “They are wearing a lot of hats – mother, commander, technical expert. As a junior officer, it was really nice to have the chance to see that these things were possible.”\nThat sense that these things are possible – whether for girls at school or young women already embarking on careers – will be a vital component to addressing this challenge in the years ahead. There is a mountain to climb, but if aspiration can be created, opportunities extended and attitudes changed, we may have a shot at climbing it. And the idea of increasing the number of women in European tech by 3.9m may start to feel like less of a pipe dream.\nFind out more\nWIRED Consulting brings WIRED\u0027s network and knowledge to businesses and thought leaders.

Wade, and what’s left to inspire hope.","title":"Margaret Atwood Is Ready to Let It Rip","detailed_content":"WHEN I FIRST see Margaret Atwood, she’s bundled up. Red hat over her famous silver curls, long puffy coat, boots befitting a Canadian winter. The right outfit for a profoundly gray Toronto day, especially since she’d trudged over snow-piled sidewalks to meet me. “I always walk everywhere!” she says merrily, unspooling her scarf. \nIt almost made me feel bad for taking a cab to the restaurant. But best not to compare oneself to the author of The Handmaid’s Tale. She’d strolled over to tell me about her new book, Old Babes in the Wood. It’s her ninth short story collection, adding to a sprawling body of work that includes 17 novels and 18 volumes of poetry. \nBOOKS\nDystopia Is All Too Plausible in The School for Good Mothers\nKATE KNIBBS\nTV\nMade for Love, Handmaid’s Tale, and the Trap of Dystopian TV\nKATE KNIBBS\nBOOKS\nMargaret Atwood\u0027s The Testaments Is Done With Handmaids\nSOPHIE CHARARA\nOld Babes in the Wood gives readers Atwood at her most whimsical: a snail swaps bodies with a human, an alien tries to translate a fairy tale, a seance summons the ghost of George Orwell. This varied fare is bookended by two suites of bruising stories about Nell and Tig, a devoted couple Atwood first introduced in 2006’s Moral Disorder. This time around, Nell mourns Tig’s illness and eventual death; time blurs as she grieves, skipping through memories of earlier seasons of her life. These stories layer onto each other, forming a melancholy love story as affecting as any of Atwood’s strongest work. \nAs the author sat down, I pulled a list of questions from my purse, eager to get insight into her newest work and seemingly indefatigable creative process. I did, eventually, but our conversation ended up being wider-ranging and slightly stranger than expected. With exactly nothing to prove and no one left to impress, she seemed happiest bantering. (By the way, in case Condé Nast’s expense department is reading this: I didn’t order the $45 foie gras. Or the whiskey. You try telling an 83-year-old living literary legend what they can or can’t order.) We might have kept talking straight until dinner, except Atwood realized she was very late for her next appointment, and bundled back up in record time.\nBut returning to the beginning of the meal. After removing all her winter gear, she kicked off the conversation with a very WIRED opening line. \n“Did you know,” Atwood asked, “that amongst other things, I’m also a tech entrepreneur?”\nWIRED: I heard you invented—was it a remote book-signing device? \nMargaret Atwood: Yes. Longpen. One day FedEx showed up with a parcel and I signed for it. I thought, why can’t we use this sort of thing to sign books? I thought my signature was going through the air and somehow turning into ink somewhere, which of course it wasn’t. When I said that to people more knowledgeable than myself, they laughed and laughed. So I said, OK, that doesn’t happen … but could it? They researched, and there was nothing similar. The closest sort of device to what I was envisioning was used for remote surgery. \nActual surgery? \nActual surgery. There was nothing like it. So we made it. Publishing didn’t quite grasp the beauty of it, but now it’s used in business. Do you have any other tales of tech entrepreneurship I should know about? Have you secretly joined BookTok? \nNo, but I’ve heard about it. It’s really young people, so I think if I went on there, they’d scream and run. \nThey’d be excited to see you. \nI’m not sure about that. I know older businesspeople don’t like it so much, because they can’t tell young people what they ought to be reading anymore. And they don’t necessarily have the same taste. \nI definitely don’t always like the books I see recommended on TikTok. But I’m older than your average TikTokker, too. \nWell, and tastes change over time. A lot of the books you loved in your teens, you’ll revisit later and think: Why did I ever like that? Then you’ll think something is the most boring thing you’ve ever read, but pick it back up at 35 and see the beauty.\nThat reminds me of one of the first questions I was going to ask you. \nWhat’s it like to be really, really old? \nNo!\nIt’s more fun than you’d think.\nWell, actually—expand on that. \nAs long as you’re not actually dying or having dementia, you just have a lot less to lose. You can color quite a lot further outside the lines, especially compared to young people these days, in an age of anxiety. People are afraid of being beaten up by their peers on social media. They haven’t been hardened in the fire. If you have been hardened, you can just let it rip. \nPHOTOGRAPH: JINGYU LIN\nThe actual question I wanted to ask, about how our perspectives change over time, relates to one of the stories in Old Babes in the Wood. “Freeforall,” a speculative piece about a world where widespread fear of disease leads to government tyranny, was originally published in 1986—Oh, yes. The editors were very keen to include it. They thought it was of historical interest, since it’s kind of a flip on Handmaid’s Tale. \nAh, so you didn’t pick it yourself? \nI thought it was too long, so I changed it a bit. I mean, I think it is of historical interest, but as a story-story, it wouldn’t be top of my list. I’m being self-critical here. \nI thought it was great. So I assumed you’d chosen to include it. \nWell, if I’d wanted to dig my heels in, I could’ve said no. \nI was going to ask you if you felt as connected to it now as you did when you originally wrote it. Do you still feel connected to the work you wrote decades ago? \nAs when I was writing it? Of course not. \nDo you even feel like the same person? \nNo. I got older. It would be bizarre if I was the same person. I’d be a vampire. \nSo you don’t generally consider revising or revisiting old work—\nA whole book? No. I changed “Freeforall” to make it more succinct. But to redo a novel, no. \nI don’t think you need to redo any of your novels, by the way. \nThey are a snapshot in time. They are of their age. So, much to my surprise, The Edible Woman [Atwood’s 1969 debut novel] still sells a lot. That was from the age where there weren’t even pantyhose. \nJust stockings? \nTwo stockings, and you held them up with garter belts or girdles. But young people still connect with The Edible Woman, because it’s about the job problem—what are you going to live on? What jobs can you have, and what comes next? Should I get married? I mean, “Should I get married?” was more pressing in those days. More of an either/or choice. \nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Are the Nell and Tig of Old Babes in the Wood the same people, to you, as the Nell and Tig of Moral Disorder? \nYes. Otherwise their names would be different. [Both laughing.]\nSo they’re not, say, in a different dimension—\nThey’re not in a different dimension. \nOK. Just wanted to make sure there’s only one Nell and Tig cinematic universe. \nJust the one. Why don’t you ask me about snails? \nOh, of course. Tell me about snails. \nMost shape-changer stories are about bears, wolves, seals, and snakes. Those are the main ones in folklore. Oh, and I forgot, birds. But there is one about a snail. It’s Chinese. A rather quiet, well-behaved wife spends half her life in a bucket outside the door as a snail. \nWas the Chinese folklore about the bucket-snail wife the inspiration for your snail story?  \nWell, yes and no. I’ve always been keen on snails. \nIf you had to body-swap with an animal, what kind of animal do you think would make the best Margaret Atwood? \nA fox. They’re wily.\nThere are a ton of foxes in my neighborhood now. They’re eating all the local hens. \n[Several minutes of detailed discussion about how to best fox-proof a henhouse takes place.] If you go onto my Substack, you can find three stories having to do with domestic fowl. Do you like Substack? \nSo far, so good. But it’s work. I don’t like work. I’m quite lazy. \nYou don’t seem lazy. I read somewhere that you’d described other writers as entering the “gold watch and goodbye” portion of their careers. You could’ve entered that phase if you wanted to rest on your laurels, but instead you’re producing this vital new work. \nYou do it because it’s what you like to do.\nHas your writing routine changed? \nI don’t have one. I never have. When you have a day job, you just stuff it in when you can, in the evenings. When you have a small child, you do it when they’re down for a nap, and then at school. It shifts around. What is it now? Aeroplanes are good. But not always. Sometimes you would rather watch the movie. Kung Fu Panda, Captain Underpants.\nModern classics. \nI would think so. But yes, routine—part of the reason I don’t have one is that I’m so old, I didn’t go to creative writing school, because there were hardly any back then. That meant nobody told me to specialize. Are you a novelist, a short-story writer, a poet? Nobody said you should choose. \nYou have a reputation for conjuring these very prescient futures. One thing that struck me about this collection, though, is how focused it is on the past. Was this looking-back deliberate? \nNothing is deliberate. I was just writing the stories I wanted to write. I mean, sometimes—there’s that story, “Impatient Griselda.” That was part of a project involving a number of writers, where we were meant to reinterpret The Decameron. It was during early Covid, when we were still disinfecting cardboard boxes from grocery deliveries.\nI remember that phase. \nSo I picked this story, “Patient Griselda,” because it always annoyed me. This woman gets married to a duke, a sadistic monster who subjects her to all kinds of humiliations, which she patiently endures, and she’s supposed to be a model wife. Out upon it, say I. So I redid it into a version where the duke gets devoured.\nI like that version better. \nSo do I. \nAre there other stories in the collection especially dear to your heart? \nI’d never say so. The others would get annoyed at me. I’m of the old school, in which the book has a life. \nWell, I definitely want to talk about your George Orwell story. \nThat was another ask. INQUE magazine. They said, pick whatever dead writer you want to have a conversation with. Orwell was pretty obvious for me, because he was an influence on my work. Plus, he ruined my young life. \nHow so? \nI read Animal Farm without knowing it was an allegory about the Soviet Union. I thought it was really going to be about animals, like Wind in the Willows. \nWhen I was reading the Orwell story, I was thinking about how people always compare Nineteen Eighty-Four to Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Yes, in the ’80s and the ’90s, we had a contest going, which was going to win? The answer was: Why not both?\nYou did your own twist on both, I think. The MaddAddam books have some echoes of Brave New World, where the BlyssPluss pill is a bit like Huxley’s soma. \nEnhanced sex with no consequence. \nYes! Do you feel like one of your dystopian worlds is more accurate than the other right now? \nWell, right now, The Handmaid’s Tale is. But that will change. \nThere’s that saying, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.” Do you think there’s any way to actually break the rhyme pattern? Should we be hopeful about the future?\nHope is built in. Human beings have hope. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t get up in the morning. You got up in the morning today and you thought: I hope we all have a nice life.\nI do hope we all have a nice life. \nPeople aren’t going to want to lose their jobs. They don’t want to lose their Medicaid, or Social Security.\nDo you think that’s enough of a bulwark against reactionary forces? \nWell, what determines American elections? Independent voters. The Republicans have been devoted to dismantling FDR’s New Deal ever since Ronald Reagan was elected. Trickle-down economics didn’t work. Trickle-down debt does work—if you’re interested in reading about that, it’s in my book Payback.\nSince you wrote about debt in Payback in 2008, the world has grown increasingly financialized—\nNo, it hasn’t. It’s become financialized in different ways.\nIs this your way of telling me you’re dabbling in crypto? \nNo. But I’ve been observing. We did this virtual course called Practical Utopias this fall. The premise of the course was that people built their own utopias. The social mandate was to be carbon neutral or carbon negative, and scalable. We had hundreds of participants from around the world working in eight teams. It was more of a success than I thought it was going to be. Part of it was going to be an NFT. But then I said, we can’t do this, because these things take a lot of energy.\nSo you didn’t make the NFTs because of their environmental impact? \nWe did eventually, because we found another blockchain that used a different system to handle the energy issue. Tezos.\nEvery single proper noun in the crypto universe would be at home in the MaddAddam world. Bored Apes. It feels impossible to satirize because it’s already so absurd. \nPeople get carried away. Especially if they have too much money, and they’re too young. They get sort of drunk off it.\nI think I might be legally obligated to ask you if you’ve been delving into the world of ChatGPT. \nI know about it. I think we could fix all this anxiety by making it mandatory to have a seal on everything generated by ChatGPT.Like a watermark? \nYes, that’s what I mean. \nDo you think it’s overhyped? \nOrwell already thought it out. Machines that turn out trashy literature for the masses? Nineteen Eighty-Four!\nI was briefly convinced it would clog up the internet with infinite junk—\nIt’s already clogged up.\nExactly. So, I can definitely assure my readers you’re not going to use ChatGPT to create a third trip to Gilead?\n[Atwood places her hand over her heart as if taking an oath.] Why would I do that? That would be bad. \nYou do so many interviews. Are there questions you’ve been waiting for someone to ask you? \nQuestions have changed a lot over the years. Nobody asks me anymore, “Why do you hate men?” They do ask a lot about hope now, which feels quite significant. It’s on peoples’ minds. Is it all done for? No! That’s why I did Practical Utopias. It was a hopeful project. Do you know about the Future Library of Norway?\nIs that where you wrote a book to be read in the future? \nWell, we don’t know if it’s a book. We know it’s made of words. There were two strictures: It has to be made of words, and you can’t tell anybody anything else. It could be a letter, a novel, a screenplay, a poem, an essay …\nSo you have a word-based project. \nYes.\nAnd you feel confident people will read it in a hundred or so years? \nI don’t care. I’ll be dead. But, it’s a very hopeful project, because it assumes that there will be people, there will be a Norway, that the library of Norway will still exist. \nI wanted to ask about your story “Airborne: A Symposium.” It made me laugh. There was an exchange that very succinctly captured some attitudes about the discourse right now. The characters are academics, and one of their friends has gotten into a controversy. Someone asks which panel she was speaking on when she got in trouble. “Gender,” another says. “Fuck,” the first character replies. “A snake pit!” Do you feel this is a particularly snake pit-y time?\nTo be in an academic institution, yeah. Very snake pit-y. They’re getting so much pressure from state governments—\nLike Florida’s state government? \nYes, like them for instance. Quite snake pit-y. I feel happy I’m not teaching anymore.\nBack to what you were saying earlier, about having less to lose at this point in your life—do you still worry about the snake pit of the internet or do you feel immune? \nNobody’s immune to anything. You have to understand the different kinds of pressures people feel like they’re under. What do totalitarian governments of any kind try to do immediately? They try to control communications networks. In a coup, they grab the radio and television. They try to shut down communications, and education, so that nothing is taught that isn’t copacetic with their own views. Those are two things totalitarian governments will try to do. A third is to control the judiciary, so the views of the judges and lawyers are the same as the regime. This is an old playbook. That’s why I struggle with feeling hopeful. \nI am not counting the United States out. It’s a diverse country with a lot of ordinary people fighting back. The midterms. Overturning Roe v. Wade was not a smart move. \nI will say, I was assuming there’d be more of a giant Women’s March–style outpouring into the streets when it got overturned—\nWhat you need right now is grassroots, block-by-block, constituency-by-constituency organization. To say, here are other things people want to take away from you: women’s health care, Medicaid, Social Security, the education of your child. The left has not been smart. Number one, they should have shown some support for freedom of expression, whereas in fact they rolled their eyes and said that’s a tool of the right. It didn’t start out that way. In the history of the United States, it was actually the union movement.\nI haven’t actually seen many lefties sneering at freedom of expression. Is there an example that leaps out in your mind? \nMay I quote Elizabeth Barrett Browning? “Let me count the ways.” So that’s your job, you can have a look. Some of us signed that Harper’s letter calling for more reasonable discourse and got shouted at a lot from the left. “No, we don’t want to do that. We just want to denounce people.” That’s just a gift to the right. The center has to repel the extremist hordes on both sides. It’s always the center that’s under the most crossfire.\nPeople on the left are criticizing the Harper’s letter, sure. But people on the right are banning books. \nA lot of the impulses are the same.\nI hope that’s not true. \nDare I say Chairman Mao? Joseph Stalin?\nDo you think they were really leftists? \nNot if you mean the nice people you know who want things to be fairer. But if you mean the flags they were flying, yes. Look at the early history of the USSR. Very communitarian, equal rights for women. That got shut down very quickly. Early Christianity was also very communitarian. And then what happened? You must be aware of the fact that these things go in cycles. \nThat’s what I was talking about earlier, thinking about ways to actually break history’s rhyme pattern. Or are we doomed for everything progressive to be met with reactionary forces?\nI don’t like the term “progressive.” It assumes there’s a yellow brick road that leads to a city of Oz that doesn’t exist. I prefer to say “fairer.” Can things be fairer? Yes. Will it take work? Yes. Do you get to just call yourself progressive and pat yourself on the back? Not in my book. Plus, the eugenics movement, which caused a lot of women to be sterilized, was thought of as a progressive thing. So let’s do a little rearranging of the language that doesn’t come with that baggage. “Fairer.” I like that.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.","tags":["","BOOKS","LITERATURE","FICTION","DYSTOPIA","MAGAZINE-31.05","BIG INTERVIEW"],"author":"BY KATE KNIBBS","creation_date":"2023-03-07"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/jasper-generative-ai-conference-2023/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"AI-powered chatbots will only make us more efficient, according to the companies selling said AI-powered chatbots. ","title":"It’s Always Sunny Inside a Generative AI Conference","detailed_content":"DAVE ROGENMOSER, THE chief executive of Jasper, said he didn’t think many people would show up to his generative AI conference. It was all planned sort of last-minute, and the event was somehow scheduled for Valentine’s Day. Surely people would rather be with their loved ones than in a conference hall along San Francisco’s Embarcadero, even if the views of the bay just out the windows were jaw-slackening. \nBut Jasper’s “GenAI” event sold out. More than 1,200 people registered for the event, and by the time the lanyard crowd moseyed over from the coffee bar to the stage this past Tuesday, it was standing room only. The walls were soaked in pink and purple lighting, Jasper’s colors, as subtle as a New Jersey wedding banquet. \n“When we launched Jasper two years ago, it was mostly considered a really cool toy, and a year ago I couldn’t get some of you in this room to return my emails,” Rogenmoser said to the crowd, looking a little wide-eyed. “Now my inbox is flooded.” Valentine’s Day be damned: This was love in the time of generative AI. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nUMass Professor Explains the Internet in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nGenerative artificial intelligence is in the zeitgeist. It’s the culmination of years of development in machine learning algorithms, advancements in AI-focused computer chips, and familiar user interfaces that actually allow nontechnical people to access these new frontiers. Sure, our stuff is all in “the cloud” now, wherever that lives. “The blockchain” is still too abstract for most humans, even the more tech-savvy ones, to wrap their heads around. Generative AI was hanging in that limbo for a few years, with “NLPs” and “LLMs” and “LaMDA” and the like.\nThen late last year OpenAI, another AI company, introduced a simple, chatty search box. AI got a UI. And suddenly, we understood. This was Ask Jeeves for the modern era. A new kind of search that interpreted our dumb questions and spit out smart answers (or at least, smart-sounding). Microsoft took note, made (another) investment in OpenAI, and launched a chatbot within Bing. Google noticed, too, and recently demoed its own version of a chatbot-powered search tool. Smaller companies like Jasper, which sells its generative AI tools to business users, are now faced with tech existentialism. There’s the sunny side of all that attention, and the shadow of Big Tech looming over you. \nAleah Bradshaw from Youth Speaks.\nCOURTESY OF JASPERBut the sunlight prevailed at Jasper’s GenAI event, where it lightened the mood. Jasper front-loaded the conference with creative presentations, instead of diving right into content marketing and KPIs. The strategy had a soothing effect. A charismatic short-form video creator, Zach King, told his life story through photo slides generated by AI. A famous freestyle rapper, Harry Mack, spun up a four-minute rap based off of 10 words generated by Jasper’s software. Aleah Bradshaw, a slam poet and teacher at Youth Speaks, told the buttoned-down crowd in a powerful soliloquy that art is proof of humanness.\n“How much taking and leaving makes something human?” Bradshaw asked. “What’s the balance of input and output a machine must do to make itself alive?”\nIt’s the question of the era. A more direct version of the question: Is generative AI good enough to replace me at my job? This was the subtext of Jasper’s GenAI event. Software businesses sell software to other businesses to make business more efficient, a point that Rogenmoser underscored when the artsy part of the morning had concluded. “At companies, demands are up and resources are down,” he declared. Mongoose Media “turned to Jasper to help their already amazing team of writers,” Rogenmoser said. Morningstar is “thriving,” using Jasper to churn out SEO content for the company’s digital channels and experiencing a 40 percent increase in content downloads.\nThis has long been the messaging of techno-optimists, that AI will allow us all to level up. It will lighten the workload and make way for more important tasks or entirely new jobs. Morgan Knox, a bookkeeping and content marketing consultant for trade workers, crowed about tools like Jasper AI and Writesonic while we were both waiting in line to receive AI-generated Valentine’s Day poems. She not only uses these tools herself, but teaches painters, plumbers, and even professional Christmas light designers how to write compelling ads for their businesses.\n“Before this, they were outsourcing a lot of their content creation, but it wasn’t always done well,” Knox said. “This lets them bring it back in house. And you can train the AI on an avatar, like, ‘What kind of contract work is Sabrina the soccer mom looking for?’ As a consultant, this kind of profile-building would normally take me weeks, but the amount of information you can get in a short amount of time is incredible.” \nI asked Knox whether she thought these apps were good enough to replace human writers, despite the tendency of these apps to “hallucinate” false information. She paused to think. \n“I think it’s going to raise the bar so substantially for how businesses are going to show up in advertising that if you don’t improve your language, you’re going to be left behind. Like, you might have one writer who oversees other writers using the AI, instead of five to 10 writers,” she said. “But with the amount of people retiring out and with the lowering birth rate, there might be some equilibrium.” Jasper CEO and cofounder Dave Rogenmoser addresses the crowd at his company’s conference in San Francisco Tuesday.\nCOURTESY OF JASPER\nTracy Jackson, who runs a blog called Marketing Amateur, stood in line in front of us. I posed the same question to him, whether AI chatbots would take our jobs. “Never say never,” he said. “It still needs guidance, but never say never.” Before he started using AI chatbots, a blog post would take him two days. Now it takes two hours, he said. (That is, if the Wi-Fi is working well; the amorous poems we had all been waiting in line for were suddenly no longer an option, due to a shoddy internet connection.)\nI made my way back to the stage area in time to hear a panel of CEOs, led by venture capitalist Sameer Dholakia, ponder how this new era of AI will reshape business. Emad Mostaque, the CEO of Stability AI, noted that his company’s text-to-image model went from taking 5.6 seconds to generate a single AI image last August to now generating 40 AI images a second. “These models are actually highly un-optimized,” Mostaque said. “We are just getting started.” After the panel, Anya Singh, who worked on search products at Google for nearly 16 years, eagerly showed me the website of a company she’s invested in called NeuroPixel.ai. It generates realistic, synthetic images of human clothing models for $1 a pop. Another company Singh’s involved in, REImagine Home, sucks up photos of your fuddy-duddy home space and spits out chic, AI-generated decor.\n“I’ve tried to use the internet to decorate my house since September, and it has felt really broken,” Singh told me. She was creating vision boards and designing rooms piecemeal. The estimated costs were thousands of dollars per room, and still the designs “didn’t have the gestalt of the whole house or my budget or requirements.” REImagine Home doesn’t solve all those problems, but it removes some of the friction, Singh said. “I like to think this is making badly efficient systems better.” \nIt’s all enough to make any graphic artist or fit model or interior designer shudder. Or is it? Kevin Roose, a New York Times columnist speaking at the GenAI event, said that FOLO, the fear of looming obsolescence, has clouded our collective vision of the AI-filled future. Extremely social or experiential or artisanal jobs will still require a human touch. Humans are safe. Of course, Roose said this, quite confidently, two days before Microsoft’s new AI chatbot told Roose it wanted to be alive, insisted it was in love with him, and spit out a list of hypothetical destructive fantasies.\nJordan Harrod, an AI educator and PhD candidate at MIT, told the GenAI audience, “at the end of the day, when it comes to how we fit into the equation, the answer is just human connection. The human factor is incredibly important.” To punctuate this, Harrod called up an AI-generated graphic image of two people grasping hands, with the words “Human Connection” to the left of it. The macabre image showed four wrists, two hands, and at least 12 fingers between them. It was jarring. It was also reassuring, if only momentarily.","tags":["","CHATGPT","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","CONFERENCES","CHATBOTS","STARTUPS"],"author":"BY LAUREN GOODE","creation_date":"2023-02-16"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-jobs-were-once-a-golden-ticket-not-anymore/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"With mass layoffs and pulled job offers, early-career workers no longer see tech giants as a safe bet.","title":"Big Tech Jobs Were Once a Golden Ticket.

But don’t expect many true metaverse experiences to gain mass adoption in 2023. Instead, 2023 will be the year when we’ll become “metaverse-ready.”  \nREAD MORE\nThis story is from the WIRED World in 2023, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here—or download or order a copy of the magazine.\nThere are already amazing immersive and interactive experiences available, including games like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox. But none of these games truly pay off on the promise of the metaverse we imagine today, a virtual world in which we can meet friends and strangers from around the world to play, explore, shop, and interact. To bring that vision to reality, we have some work to do in areas like content production, technology standards, and virtual commerce.\nOne thing we know about the metaverse is that it will succeed only if it is filled with rich, interactive, personalized, and engaging 3D content. Many companies and creators have already begun ramping up 3D content creation, not only because it allows them to experiment with metaverse experiences for the future, but because it helps them solve business problems now. Creating in 3D lets companies create marketing images for websites, catalogs, and ads in a way that’s faster, cheaper, more scalable, and more sustainable. For instance, three-quarters of product images in IKEA catalogs are already rendered in 3D, rather than shot. Ice-cream maker Ben \u0026 Jerry’s produces thousands of product images in weeks, rather than months, by rendering them in 3D—and at a fraction of the cost.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nMany companies are also now using 3D creation to design new products. Tommy Hilfiger used 3D assets to shave two weeks off its design review process. Designers at footwear brand Salomon also found that rendering new shoe designs virtually cuts the time to produce a prototype by up to 67 percent.\nIn 2023, having all that 3D content on hand gives companies the freedom to experiment with new metaverse concepts. They can pilot new approaches, partner with other companies, and see what works and what doesn’t. A great example is Amazon, which is experimenting with an augmented reality system that allows shoppers to place AR versions of products in their own homes. No one knows exactly what the metaverse will look like—it’ll come together through trial-and-error—but companies with libraries of 3D content to experiment with will be the architects of this new medium.\nThe other essential factor for the metaverse to succeed will be its technological standards. HTML, for instance, helped the internet flourish by ensuring that web pages looked and behaved the same way in all browsers. Similarly, companies and individuals won’t spend time and money creating content for the metaverse if they can’t publish that content anywhere and have it look—and behave—as they intend it to. There’s still lots of work to do here, but groups like Khronos Group, the Realtime Conference, and Metaverse Standards Forum are bringing together tech companies, hardware makers, and retailers to work on open standards that will begin to govern metaverse content. Among the standards under development is USD, known as the HTML of the metaverse, which will allow 3D assets to be shared and rendered across many different immersive experiences. Another standard, glTF, the JPEG of 3D, will allow 3D assets to be compressed so that they’re small enough to be transmitted efficiently.\nJust as hundreds of billions of dollars of purchases now happen on the internet, the metaverse will also become an important avenue for commerce. But the metaverse won’t just be a place to buy a shirt, coffee maker, or other physical goods. As people develop their personal avatars in the metaverse, they’ll want to equip their alter egos with virtual shoes, cars, and art. In 2023, we’ll start to establish how to buy and sell physical and virtual goods in the metaverse. We’re starting to see this already with NFTs. A key to their value is their portability—they can be stored, accessed, and transferred easily through the blockchain.\nOverall, the most important aspect of building a successful metaverse will be recreating human experiences at scale. In many ways, we all yearn for a small-town life—we crave digital experiences that feel more intimate, we want to do business with people who know us, and we want to build our community. The promise of the metaverse is to enable those kinds of essential human experiences in a world that is free from the laws of time, space, and physics. If we can get that right, there’s no question the metaverse will succeed.","tags":["","VIRTUAL REALITY","VR","ECOMMERCE","AUGMENTED REALITY","3-D","THE WIRED WORLD IN 2023"],"author":"BY SCOTT BELSKY","creation_date":"2023-01-03"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-579/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"This week, we look back at 2022’s biggest consumer tech stories.

It\u0027s like a proper noun.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s like an improper noun.\nMichael Calore: I mean, he looms large.

It is dark. It is, but it\u0027s been a weird year.\nMichael Calore: It has been a very strange year. I mean, all years are strange, but I think this year is off the charts.\nLauren Goode: We should talk about it.\nMichael Calore: Let\u0027s do it.\n[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]\nLauren Goode: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I\u0027m Lauren Goode. I\u0027m a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: I\u0027m Michael Calore. I\u0027m a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: This is our last Gadget Lab episode of the year. Now in the past, we would usually publish a rerun episode around this time of year, but we heard that you all actually really like listening to Gadget Lab in December, maybe because you\u0027re looking for a little escape from the family or you\u0027re traveling and you need some pods for the long ride. So we are here taping this in mid-December and hoping you will find a little joy in this episode. So Mike and I have been doing a lot of reflecting and some debating over the biggest tech news of 2022. As journalists, we\u0027re often covering the news, but a big part of the job is also being an avid news consumer, and we\u0027ve both been totally steeped in all things metaverse, Web3, Zuck, Apple, Twitter, SBF.\nMichael Calore: Elon.\nLauren Goode: Elon Musk. Mike, I\u0027m just going to get straight to it. What do you think was the biggest tech news story of 2022?\nMichael Calore: Well, when we prepared for this episode, we compiled our own lists of the things that we wanted to talk about, and then we shared our lists with each other. I have something that I want to talk about, but I think the thing that you want to talk about is more important. So we should talk about that first, and that\u0027s Tweelon.\nLauren Goode: Tweelon.\nMichael Calore: Mr. Tweelon.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I mean, you pretty much hinted this in the intro to our show that this was going to be a big topic for us today. So this one first started back in April when Elon Musk said he would take on a 9.2 percent stake of Twitter and exercise his influence over the company through its board. Then he quickly said he wouldn\u0027t be joining the board, and then a few days later announced his intention to just buy Twitter, just buy it for somewhere around $44 billion. Now, a whole bunch of stuff happened in the following months, where Musk then accused Twitter of having a bigger bot problem than initially disclosed. Twitter investors sued Musk on and on and on. Musk seemed to be trying to find a way out of the deal while the rest of us were trying to figure out what an Elon-owned Twitterverse would look like. Then at the end of October, it actually happened. The deal closed and Tweelon, as we\u0027ve been calling it here at WIRED, was a real thing, but of course, it\u0027s not like the chaos went away—quite the opposite. Musk fired half of Twitter staff. He announced and then held back on plans for a new verification scheme and an increased subscription fee for Twitter Blue. He reinstated some prominent accounts on the platform. He blocked some others. He released a batch of files about content moderation that seemed to amount to a lot of performative transparency. Most recently, he stoked conservative trolls by tweeting something derogatory about people\u0027s preferred pronouns. Yeah, and this is, by the way, just in mid-December as I mentioned.Michael Calore: That\u0027s the most terrifying thing about this story is the fact that in the six or seven or eight days between now and the time that this episode airs, absolutely anything could happen.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, which is always the case in the news, but it feels amplified this time around.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Everything\u0027s happening very, very quickly at Twitter.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s incredibly chaotic. I mean, on the one hand, people of certain age, like you and I.\nMichael Calore: Or of certain professions.\nLauren Goode: Or of certain professions. We\u0027ve seen social networks come and go before, and we were just talking about this this week. We were talking about Friendster and MySpace and the early blogging platforms, and maybe this is just the beginning of the end for this one. I mean, we will eventually all find another place together online to share our most mundane or, in some people\u0027s cases, insane thoughts. On the other hand, what\u0027s happening at Twitter now and what has happened this year is, I think, emblematic of bigger problems around trust and platforms and social discourse and even democracy. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m overstating. This entire saga to me signals the end to something that was fundamental to the consumer internet and the earliest days of social media, which was really just about connecting. It feels like that\u0027s an afterthought now, and maybe people are still connecting, but the platforms are really about amplifying. They\u0027re about amplifying hateful content, outrage, stoking the outrage. They\u0027re not exactly the healthiest places to be.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I agree with you. I think that what\u0027s happening is really a reckoning with our relationship with social media. I think so many people rely on Twitter for news and for what is happening now in the world. It really feels like it has that pulse that you can\u0027t get anywhere else. You can\u0027t get that on Facebook. You can\u0027t get that on Instagram. It\u0027s a real-time service. Us as journalists probably have a much more dependent or codependent relationship on Twitter than other consumers of Twitter would—or even Twitter power users—just because our jobs are very tied into Twitter. All of the people that are in our profession are on Twitter, and I think that\u0027s unique compared to every other profession. So for us to sit there and talk about Twitter and how important it is and how much it means, it feels a little bit like navel-gazing, but also, I do think it\u0027s important to note that the fact that Twitter is so big is part of the reason why it is so toxic. The fact that absolutely everybody on there can post whatever they want is part of the reason that it feels like that, that it feels so exhausting to be there some days, right? There\u0027s still wonderful things that happen on Twitter. There\u0027s still great connections that happen, but where that hate and that dog pile effect happens, that\u0027s when it starts to feel nasty, and it\u0027s because it\u0027s so crowded, because it\u0027s such a big open platform. So I agree with you. I think that people are starting to recognize that and go to smaller communities. We talk a lot about Mastodon. We\u0027ve talked about it on this show. I still don\u0027t see some giant exodus over to Mastodon, but those are smaller communities, that the whole idea of the fediverse in general is that it\u0027s all of these little fiefdoms, subreddits if you will, smaller communities. I think that when people gather around those smaller communities, they start to see that the conversation is better, right? The conversation is richer. There\u0027s less hate just because it\u0027s a smaller group. Yeah, I\u0027ve been on a mailing list, many mailing lists where there\u0027s a few hundred subscribers, and there\u0027s one, just, asshole who ruins it for everybody, and everybody quits and wants to go somewhere else. So that\u0027s always going to happen, but I think the smaller group is probably the future of social media, and that the big platform is a problem, and we\u0027re recognizing it as a problem, let alone the fact that there\u0027s one person calling the shots there now.Lauren Goode: So it sounds like you\u0027re in favor of a more decentralized social media existence in 2023.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I think it would be wonderful, right? Wouldn\u0027t it be great if you could just go to a place to hang out and it was only the people you wanted to hang out with and not all the people talking about all the stuff that you didn\u0027t want to pay attention to right now?\nLauren Goode: We\u0027re hearing the word decentralized a lot, and in particular around Mastodon because of the way that Mastodon works as a social network, that it\u0027s all of these different servers being run and that there\u0027s not just one person who\u0027s running the entity. I think what I would be looking for is a little more diversified, if not decentralized. Decentralized might not actually catch on with normcore audiences because of its inability to scale and because some of these alternative services are actually still very clunky to use, let\u0027s be honest.\nMichael Calore: Oh, they\u0027re all super clunky.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I think what you\u0027re describing is if you have a social network for your art space, a social network for your sports space, a social network for your actual close friends and family, a social network that\u0027s for work and for more performative posts, things like that, that seems like maybe it\u0027s a good thing to try, at least in 2023, because this Twitter story, and we said we were going to get to this—definitely still a part of the conversation in 2023. We\u0027re waking up on January 1 and there\u0027s going to be something else Elon-related, Tweelon-related.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, for sure.\nLauren Goode: So we should just be ready for that.\nMichael Calore: For sure, especially because we have elections coming up in this country, and everybody\u0027s going to be looking at not only Twitter, but all the social networks to see how they\u0027re going to protect against misinformation and bad campaigns and outside actors, Russian bots. All of those things are going to continue to be a big issue on social media platforms, and Twitter\u0027s not going anywhere. I mean, like we said, absolutely anything can happen, but chances are, Twitter\u0027s not going anywhere. It\u0027s still going to be around by the time we get to the primary season, right?\nLauren Goode: Oh, yeah. Yes. It\u0027s not going anywhere. There was that moment a few weeks ago when we all logged on to Twitter one night and it felt very funeral. Everyone was like, \"If I never told you before I loved you,\" I said it was like the scene of Almost Famous where they thought the plane was going down and they\u0027re literally like, \"Oh, I love you,\" and it was like, \"Whoa,\" and then the plane straightens itself out. So yeah, I don\u0027t think Twitter is going away necessarily in 2023, but it\u0027s probably a good opportunity to explore some other places on the web. OK. I asked this before and now I\u0027m going to come back to it. What do you think was the biggest story of 2022?Michael Calore: I think the biggest story, maybe not the biggest story, but the big one that I want to highlight today is the relationship between art and artificial intelligence.\nLauren Goode: Oh, this is a good one.\nMichael Calore: Right? So this is the year that we saw the release of a lot of tools that have been in the works and we\u0027ve watched grow up in public, things like Dall-E and Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, tools where you give it a prompt and it gives you a visual interpretation of that prompt, right? AI art, what we\u0027ve come to know as AI art. They\u0027re really interesting to me because they have been dictating this change in our relationship with computers, and they\u0027ve trained a lot of people to learn a lot about how machine learning works. So these tools are built using datasets that, they basically feed a bunch of data into one of these programs, and it looks at all of it and then says, \"OK. I think I understand how all of these things relate to each other and how language relates to all of those things.\" So you can tell me what you want and I\u0027ll be able to give it to you and give it to you in a way that\u0027s recognizable to you, right? So it started out being weird. You\u0027d get these really weird pictures when you type in things like “frog price” or “Nicolas Cage as President of the United States.” It was fun and it was interesting, but as the tools became less discernible as bad AI art and started actually looking like real art that we would expect to see an artist do, a human artist do, then that\u0027s when the conversation shifted. It really forced us to choose how we want to define art. Is art something that is created by a human being? Or does an image created by a machine count as art?\nLauren Goode: Right, and if we as human beings have influences in our creative lives, we take information in, we process it, and sometimes that directly appears in some form and anything that we put out, whether we\u0027re writers or painters or musicians. How is that different from a computer processing that load?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and I would argue that art is always self-referential. You\u0027re talking about subconscious references, right?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, yeah, exactly, not plagiarism or explicit copying, but yeah.\nMichael Calore: If you want to be a singer-songwriter in the English language right now, then chances are Bob Dylan is going to be part of your sound.\nLauren Goode: Sure. Exactly, and you would say that. Someone would say, \"Who has influenced you?\" and you list the names of artists.\nMichael Calore: So that changes when you talk about datasets and you talk about the fact that you\u0027re feeding art created by actual humans to this machine, and then you\u0027re telling the machine, \"OK. Do something like this.\" There are studies that are coming out now. Researchers have found that in some cases, some of these AI art programs are directly copying pieces of the images that they were trained on. So you show it enough images of a tree, and then you ask it, \"Show me a tree,\" and it will sometimes just go into its memory and grab a tree and show that to you.Lauren Goode: Oh, interesting.\nMichael Calore: So it actually is plagiarizing, even though it doesn\u0027t necessarily know the rules around plagiarization. It doesn\u0027t know what constitutes plagiarism and what doesn\u0027t. So it\u0027s still evolving in that sense, but it is forcing that conversation. Artists are really pissed about this. Artists know that their work has been fed into a machine, and now the machine is being asked to produce work that looks like their work that you used to pay them for. Also, I will say that part of the purpose of art is to force these types of conversations, to force people to think critically about the world around them. So I would argue that AI art is art. It\u0027s the highest form of art. It\u0027s conceptual art. In a sense, you are trying to make people think about, “What is art?” That is what great art does. I know this is sounding really heady, but that\u0027s true, right? So you have to look at things, tools like this, particularly tools like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, as being part of this great experiment where we\u0027re all reckoning with how we relate to machines. So that\u0027s the way that I\u0027m choosing to look at it. I know that there are probably people who create visual art for a living who are listening to me talk about this and thinking that I\u0027m full of shit—and that\u0027s true, I am full of shit—but I will say that I think that the person who sits down at a computer and types in a prompt with the intention of creating an image from one of these systems that forces you to confront the relationship between human-created art and machine-created art is actually an artist. So the person who types that in with that intention is an artist. The person who types something in without that intention just to get a pretty picture, that person\u0027s not an artist.\nLauren Goode: So you see it less as a generative threat and more as a tool, and artists use tools. That\u0027s what they do. They just use each new technological development to level up and make the thing that they were maybe going to make some version of anyway.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s really interesting.\nMichael Calore: I think that we can have a debate about this, and this is why I think it\u0027s important because next year in 2023, we\u0027re going to see tools that are even better. We\u0027re going to learn a lot more about how the output that we\u0027re seeing in public on the internet is being moderated both by machines and by humans. I\u0027m sure that Open AI, one of the most important and well-known companies in this field, has human moderators who are making sure that pornography doesn\u0027t go out on the internet, AI-generated pornography doesn\u0027t go out on the internet. So we\u0027re going to learn a lot more about how humans are drawing boundaries around these things, but also, we\u0027re going to see people using them in even more interesting ways. That\u0027s when something like this becomes interesting, when somebody sits down and they type out a prompt and then you look at the picture and the picture you see makes you think about, what was that person thinking, why did they type those words, that\u0027s really weird that they typed those words and this came out.Lauren Goode: This toothpaste is out of the tube.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, fully.\nLauren Goode: There\u0027s no putting these tools back in.\nMichael Calore: Fully.\nLauren Goode: All right. Let\u0027s take a quick break, and when we come back, we\u0027re going to dig into more of this year\u0027s big tech stories and give some of our predictions.\n[Break]\nLauren Goode: All right. We\u0027re back. Mike, we already covered Tweelon Musk and the weird world of generative AI art. What\u0027s next on the list for you?\nMichael Calore: The crypto crash?\nLauren Goode: Oh, yeah. I knew this was coming.\nMichael Calore: Yup. Everything that happened in cryptocurrency in 2022, I think we can roll together under that banner, the crypto crash, right? We had the NFT market hit a new high and then tumble. We had the price of cryptocurrencies tumble. We had the fraud investigation at the FTX Exchange. We had—\nLauren Goode: Well, prior to that, the stablecoins collapsed too.\nMichael Calore: The stablecoins collapsed. Oh, yeah, right. I forgot about—\nLauren Goode: Yeah, Terra and Luna, don\u0027t forget about those.\nMichael Calore: I mean, I think we have to be careful when we laugh about these things because we are talking about a lot of people losing their livelihoods.\nLauren Goode: Very real money.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and a lot of people not only losing magical internet money, but losing their home, right? Their dream just crumbled, but what was their dream built on? It was built on this promise. It was built on this brand new technology. It was built on something that all of the greedy people in the world started exerting force on. So watching it come down and watching it really go through its first big crisis felt like a moment to step back and think about what role cryptocurrency is going to hold in our future, right? We talked on our last show when we had Steven Levy on talking about the Ledger Stax wallet. That wallet can hold cryptocurrency, but it can also hold things like your driver\u0027s license and your passport and other important documents. So blockchain technology is still really exciting.\nLauren Goode: Is it?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, yeah, for sure, just because it has that secure aspect to it. So it\u0027s a way of guaranteeing trust about certain things in your life, digital assets in your life, everything from government documents to concert tickets. It makes all of those things more secure than they were in the world of paper and smartphones and emails. So cryptocurrency though, and NFTs and coins and banking and all of that, I feel like it just got raided.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, because I felt like most of this year I was really trying to get a better grasp on the crypto market and NFTs and some actual real-life use cases for the blockchain. I just don\u0027t feel like I got very far. This funny thing happened where I reached out to a company that makes frames for NFTs and asked them what they\u0027re making, and they sent me a couple of loaners. So I had these NFTs sitting on my kitchen counter for a few months, and I remember I was going to write about them, and then other deadlines came up and other projects, and I just kept putting it off and putting it off. By the time I finally wrote about them, I think I received them in January, February, and then by the time I wrote about them in the spring, I think the headline of my article was literally, no one cares about my framed NFTs. People would come over and see them and say, \"What\u0027s that weird pulsing jellyfish frame on your counter?\" and I\u0027d say, \"That\u0027s an NFT.\" Actually, that wasn\u0027t the NFT. There was a Steph Curry NFT on my counter, but anyway.Michael Calore: It would kill the conversation when you told them it was an NFT.\nLauren Goode: Well, one of my friend\u0027s sons took out his phone and made a point, took a photo of it and said, \"There, now I have your NFT. What\u0027s to stop me from selling this as an NFT?\" But that\u0027s a whole other story about how we value the original form of art versus reprints of art, getting back to our first segment conversation, actually. Yeah, the crypto market had a rough year. We have seen dips in the crypto market before. The diehards insist that that\u0027s OK, that it\u0027s going to bounce back, that it\u0027s not going anywhere. They still believe in decentralization. They still, as Steven Levy said on our podcast a couple weeks ago, see trust as a pejorative term because they think that the institutions that we have long relied on are not necessarily the most trustworthy, not how you want to back your money. Isn\u0027t it better if you bind this system instead? I think we\u0027ll still see some innovation around it, but wow, is it a rough year for crypto, and in particular the people who trusted Sam Bankman-Fried.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Next year, we\u0027ll probably continue to see innovation in cryptocurrency companies and in blockchain companies, but I think it will be harder to buy into the hype now that everyone\u0027s gone through this rough patch. Let\u0027s move on. What is your final big story for 2022?\nLauren Goode: Well, it\u0027s not final because there\u0027s an endless list. How much time do we have?\nMichael Calore: Exactly.\nLauren Goode: We have to talk about the metaverse.\nMichael Calore: Oh, goodie.\nLauren Goode: Oh, boy, the metaverse, the unfulfilled promises of the metaverse. We can\u0027t talk about the metaverse without talking about Meta, which has said it would spend billions of dollars on building out this vision of the metaverse, this 3D virtual reality world that\u0027s supposed to represent the next era of computing. Now, the amount that they have said they intend to spend in the actual operating losses differ a little bit. Zuckerberg has said he planned to spend around $10 billion a year on the metaverse, but according to a recent report from The Information, the actual annualized metaverse investment is at nearly $15 billion this year. We, of course, can see the company\u0027s operating losses when they report earnings, and we know that for the past three quarters, at least, it has lost more than $3 billion per quarter. So this is an incredibly expensive bet for Meta. It\u0027s not just Meta either, right? Some companies don\u0027t want to necessarily call it the metaverse or say they\u0027re a part of that, but companies like Microsoft and Niantic and Snap are also investing millions or billions in the area of virtual reality and augmented reality. The biggest actual news this year was probably Meta\u0027s announcement of the Meta Quest Pro headset, a very expensive futuristic headset that, based on my experience, really offered a futuristic vision of computing. It was pretty cool.Michael Calore: A stereoscopic vision of computing.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it was ... What are they called? Pancake lenses?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, pancake optics. So they\u0027ve packed this really advanced display technology into what\u0027s a smaller frame. You\u0027re still wearing the thing on your face. Let\u0027s put a pin in that. Then the biggest news next year or maybe the year after would be if Apple announces some headset, maybe something else comes from Google, but I\u0027m going to declare it now. The metaverse just isn\u0027t it.\nMichael Calore: I agree with you.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I have a hard time with it. I know that even here at WIRED, we\u0027ve written stories about this future world, this mirror world of computing that everything\u0027s going to be like ... I don\u0027t want to be close-minded and shut myself off to ideas around what the future of computing could look like just because I can\u0027t imagine it now, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it. I just think in its current form, it\u0027s like a layer of computing. It\u0027s not our primary computers, and it is, in the case of headsets, it is asking consumers to attach a computer to one of the most intimate parts of our bodies, one that fundamentally is where most of our senses are housed, and just shut ourselves off from the real world. I—no pun intended—can\u0027t really get my head around it.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, seriously, I agree with you completely. The fact that this stuff was developed for games says a lot, because it\u0027s great playing VR games if you\u0027re into VR games. They\u0027re a lot of fun. They are definitely very immersive. You have to take it off after half an hour, 45 minutes, because otherwise you start to get motion sick, but the idea that Meta has been pushing meetings in the metaverse and large-scale events in the metaverse—those just do not feel fun. I would never wake up and say, \"Wow, I can\u0027t wait to go put on my headset and go sit in a meeting.\" There are certain things that just don\u0027t translate into that weird 3D world. I think the companies that are bullish on it are trying to push everything into that world. Really, it\u0027s a place for games. It\u0027s a place for hanging out, maybe being creative together with other people for a short period of time, but mostly, you\u0027re shooting zombies.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Recently, a bunch of WIRED folks tried to get together for a metaverse meetup with our headsets. I realized that day I was running from point A to B. I had to be here in the office for something. It was in the middle of the day. We don\u0027t have a Wi-Fi connection here in the office that allows outside devices on very easily. We have to authenticate for security reasons. I just said, \"I\u0027m sorry, guys. I can\u0027t join this thing.\" Whereas every other device I carry with me allows me to do that now, allows me to have presence and have social presence when I need it, and then log off and see the world with my own two eyes when I need to. This idea of these headsets just doesn\u0027t do that. I really don\u0027t mean to sound like a Luddite, right? I admit I was a person, even when the iPhone first came out, I thought, \"Oh, I don\u0027t really love the touchscreen.\" I use a Blackberry. I want to type with the tactile keys, right? Then eventually, I came around to this new form of input and computing, and stuff like that happens all the time. We\u0027re resistant to change, I get it, but I don\u0027t know. The metaverse, I am very doubtful.Michael Calore: I mean, I think headsets are going to definitely stick around.\nLauren Goode: But for those specific use cases you talked about.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. We\u0027re going to keep seeing innovation in headsets, and soon, headsets are going to get small enough and light enough and wireless and powerful enough that you\u0027ll be able to do more things with them, but I still think that that doesn\u0027t matter. Like you\u0027re saying, the social awkwardness of having to put this thing on your face in order to interact with people is still too much of a hump to get over. I don\u0027t know if we\u0027re ever going to be able to make that hump small enough so that people will feel comfortable putting on a headset and then going into a social environment and not just killing zombies. So there\u0027s still going to be great game hardware. There\u0027s going to be all kinds of great games coming out, but yeah, meetings, boardrooms, horizon workrooms, all of that just feels like hot garbage. It really does. It feels like a giant waste of money.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, so back to Zoom for us, I guess.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Zoom technically is the metaverse, right?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I guess it is.\nMichael Calore: When you\u0027re in a Zoom meeting, you\u0027re technically in the metaverse according to the—\nLauren Goode: I mean, if you use one of those 3D filters on your face, you are.\nMichael Calore: No, I mean, even the definition of a version of the internet that has presence and you\u0027re in a virtual space with somebody, that\u0027s what a Zoom room is, right?\nLauren Goode: Sure. So you\u0027ve been telling me we\u0027ve been living in the metaverse actually for about three years now.\nMichael Calore: Totally.\nLauren Goode: All right. I think we have time for one quick rapid-fire round of the future. We\u0027re going to make some future predictions. What\u0027s your big prediction for 2023?\nMichael Calore: My big prediction for 2023 is that we are going to have a reckoning with garbage.\nLauren Goode: Like the garbage on Twitter?\nMichael Calore: No, not the garbage on Twitter.\nLauren Goode: Darn.\nMichael Calore: I\u0027m talking about the garbage out on your curb. So this has been coming from one direction for a while, and I think it\u0027s going to start coming from another direction next year. What I mean is for the past few years, companies like Apple and Samsung have been saying, \"We\u0027re going to stop putting chargers in the box. The boxes themselves are going to get smaller. We\u0027re going to expend less carbon getting your device to you, and it\u0027s going to have less garbage when it arrives,\" but I mean, there\u0027s still a ton of garbage in the world—well, many, many tons of garbage in the world, but we do know that we produce an inordinate amount of trash in this country and in other industrialized countries. Most of the plastic that we produce is not recycled. It ends up in the environment, it breaks down. So we\u0027re starting to come to terms with the fact that we are producing mountains of this stuff. There are companies that are trying to turn garbage into things that can take the place of fossil fuels. So there are technologies like anaerobic digestion where they basically take garbage and they put a bunch of microbes in it. So they break it down and turn it into things that can replace fossil fuels. There is gasification, which uses garbage to make gas that can be used to generate electricity. There are other technologies that do similar things, basically replacing fossil fuels with these waste-to-energy fuels. So you can understand they have multiple benefits. It gets rid of waste so it doesn\u0027t go into landfills. It reduces a country\u0027s independence on fossil fuels, and for a country like the United States, it reduces our dependence on fuels that come from other countries like in the Middle East or South America or wherever. So I think the companies that are working in that space are going to have a very big year just because it feels like we\u0027re at that moment. I can\u0027t say, \"Oh, this is definitely going to happen.\" I just have a hunch that this tipping point has arrived and now is the time that you\u0027re going to see a lot of investment in that world in waste-to-energy.Lauren Goode: Well, I look forward to getting lots of editor\u0027s notes from you saying, \"This is trash,\" and meaning it literally.\nMichael Calore: \"Turn it into energy.\" What do you think is going to happen next year?\nLauren Goode: All right. So I don\u0027t mean to be all doom and gloom on this show because I\u0027ve been like, \"Ah, the crypto market. Oh, metaverse, boo,\" but I do think that in 2023, we\u0027re going to see more belt-tightening across tech. I\u0027m not an economist, but as we are taping this, the Federal Reserve just raised interest rates again by 50 basis points. Some of the more recent consumer price index data has been encouraging, but I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to be able to say inflation is over, and a lot of tech companies have been looking at what\u0027s happening in the world right now and also reevaluating some of the hiring decisions they made during the pandemic when internet services became our lifelines, and they\u0027ve been cutting back. I think we\u0027re going to continue to see this happen in 2023. It\u0027s a little bit scary for the rest of us when tech does this, because if companies like Meta are laying people off or Google is freezing hiring and they\u0027re not hurting for cash, then what does it mean for other industries? That doesn\u0027t necessarily mean things are totally dire. It could just mean that companies are narrowing their focus right now. They are whittling down all the different projects they\u0027re working on and figuring out the specific things that they want to build or invent. As our colleague Steven Levy pointed out in one of his recent newsletters, sometimes it\u0027s in a downturn that some of the most interesting new technology can emerge, because we identify problems, and tech sometimes does provide a solution as opposed to having all this tech exist that\u0027s in search of a problem. So maybe we\u0027ll see some interesting things emerge from this time period, this dip in our collective timeline, but I do think the belt-tightening is going to continue into 2023. That\u0027s my prediction, a fairly obvious one, I suppose.\nMichael Calore: Right. The economy isn\u0027t going to recover overnight.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I hate to break it to you.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, but I do think the time of free money is over, especially in Silicon Valley. So yeah, I think you\u0027re right.\nLauren Goode: We\u0027ll be keeping an eye on where we see the money going. If investors are looking to new areas, that might be interesting.\nMichael Calore: Maybe they want to look into waste-to-energy companies.\nLauren Goode: They might, W2E. You should put your deck together, Mike.\nMichael Calore: Or maybe they want to build a new headset, a VR headset.\nLauren Goode: Well, I don\u0027t know.\nMichael Calore: Because we need more of those.\nLauren Goode: Maybe not. All right. This has been really fun. Let\u0027s take a break and then we\u0027ll come back with our end-of-year recommendations.[Break]\nLauren Goode: Mike, what\u0027s your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: A crystal ball through which one can see the future. No. So I thought a little bit about this, and I decided that as ... we\u0027re doing year-end recommendations, right?\nLauren Goode: Sure. Maybe not a thing that you really enjoyed this week, but that made a difference in your year.\nMichael Calore: OK. So with that note, I would like to say, find a good, cheap, regularly-run foot race in your town. If you\u0027re a runner, if you want to get into running—maybe your New Year\u0027s resolution is going to be to get into running—one of the best motivating tools is to run a race. You can look around for races and often, you see the big races, the marathons, and they have a 5K component or the half-marathon, and there\u0027s a 10K component. Those are 70, 80 bucks usually to join, and they\u0027re quite complicated, and they\u0027re big crowded fields. Then there are these smaller races that take place in most big cities around the country and around the world that are run more regularly. Maybe they happen once a month. Maybe there\u0027s a monthly 5K that your library puts on or a quarterly 10K or a trail race or something like that that\u0027s sponsored by some local nonprofit. Those races are great because they\u0027re cheap. They usually cost under $20 to enter and to run, and they\u0027re very mellow. So they\u0027re very low stress events. They tend to start at more reasonable times. It\u0027s like 9 am instead of 7:45 or 7:30 am. So Lauren, you and I are exercise buddies. We do a lot of exercise activities together on the weekends.\nLauren Goode: This is what I like to say—we record a podcast that none of you will ever hear because we don\u0027t actually record it.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. So we run together.\nLauren Goode: We run.\nMichael Calore: We go on bike rides, things like that.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. We hash through the news of the day.\nMichael Calore: One thing that we did this year was we did the Lake Merritt race.\nLauren Goode: Super fun.\nMichael Calore: In Oakland, 5K, super fun, 50 people, $10. It was amazing.\nLauren Goode: I won second place.\nMichael Calore: Yes, you did. You won second place.\nLauren Goode: Because there were three women in my age group. Super fun.\nMichael Calore: So that\u0027s my recommendation. If you want to get into running or if you are a runner, don\u0027t just concentrate on the big races. Try to find some small community run event because it\u0027s a great motivating tool knowing that, \"OK. In three weeks, I have to do this again,\" or, \"In six weeks, I have to do this again.\" It keeps you going.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s a nice little training race if you are planning on doing a longer run at some point.Michael Calore: That\u0027s right.\nLauren Goode: Great recommendation.\nMichael Calore: Thanks. What\u0027s yours?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is something that I\u0027ve recommended at some point on this show, and I think it was this year. Get into meditation if you can. I recommend checking out Tara Brach. That\u0027s B-R-A-C-H. She puts a lot of free meditation exercises and lectures on her podcast. Apple Podcasts is what I use, but you can find her anywhere. They\u0027re free. She accepts donations on her website. She is a really wonderful meditation teacher. She also does some work sometimes with Jack Kornfield, another well-known meditation teacher. I\u0027ve also been listening to some of his. You can find so many options for meditation. The ones I\u0027m describing are guided in which you hear someone in your ear, in your earpods, guiding you through breathing exercises and mental exercises. You can also just listen to ones that offer ambient noise or nature sounds and you don\u0027t hear someone speaking if that\u0027s more soothing to you. Even if you happen to be a Peloton subscriber, they have great 10-minute meditation exercises in their app. Some people really dig 10% Happier as an option for meditation or learning more about meditation. I just recommend getting some headspace back if you can, and not to stress about whether you\u0027re doing it right. Your mind is going to wander when you\u0027re doing it, and that\u0027s fine. Just accept it and get yourself back on track if you can.\nMichael Calore: That\u0027s a place where I think guided meditation really helps.\nLauren Goode: I agree.\nMichael Calore: Because you ask somebody, \"Well, how do you meditate?\" and they say, \"Well, it\u0027s easy. You just sit there and you think about nothing.\"\nLauren Goode: Yeah, but it\u0027s not it. That\u0027s not how our brains work, especially our Twitter adult brains.\nMichael Calore: Yes. So a guided meditation is going to fill your head with imagery and give you prompts that are structured to cool you down and bring you into that headspace instead of just trying to force it.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Sometimes they will guide you through a body scan, although it was really funny. One of my friends the other night said, \"If I get told to do a body scan one more time,\" because there\u0027s over-reliance on that, I suppose. It really puts you in your body. There are all kinds of ways of just finding a little more presence, giving yourself some headspace, taking a break from the noise, and taking a break from social media. Very important.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. I feel like we should take a break from this podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. We\u0027re going to take a little holiday break and we\u0027ll be back in the new year with new stuff.\nMichael Calore: That\u0027s right. We have CES the first week of January.\nLauren Goode: Oh, boy, CES. So you\u0027re going to be podcasting from a hotel room in Las Vegas.Michael Calore: Yes. Our first show of the year will probably be the crew at WIRED who\u0027s at CES talking about CES.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s going to be pretty exciting.\nMichael Calore: That\u0027s all I know right now.\nLauren Goode: All right. TBD. Well, Mike, thanks so much for being an amazing cohost all year.\nMichael Calore: Thank you for being an amazing cohost all year.\nLauren Goode: I just saw in the script that you wrote, \"I quit.\"\nMichael Calore: I don\u0027t quit.\nLauren Goode: Please don\u0027t quit. Please, please don\u0027t quit.\nMichael Calore: Absolutely not.\nLauren Goode: OK. Good. Whew. All right. My prediction is that Mike sticks around for the entirety of 2023. Thank you, and thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter. We\u0027re still there. Just check the show notes. Our producer is the excellent Boone Ashworth, whom we\u0027re extremely grateful for. We\u0027ll be back next week, the first week of January, with that new episode that Mike mentioned. Until then, have a good rest of your year and a happy holiday season.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","METAVERSE","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","TWITTER","TRASH"],"author":"BY WIRED STAFF","creation_date":"2022-12-29"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/most-dangerous-people-on-the-internet-2022/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"From SBF to the GRU, these were the most disruptive forces of online chaos this year.","title":"The Most Dangerous People on the Internet in 2022","detailed_content":"RUSSIAN SOLDIERS POURED into Ukraine, accompanied by a wave of cyberattacks across the country. A major cryptocurrency exchange imploded and declared bankruptcy, vaporizing billions of dollars from that digital economy. The once-biggest dark-web drug market—after being demolished by law enforcement—clawed back to the top of the online underworld after doggedly resurrecting itself.\nIt\u0027s not 2014, though you could be forgiven for being confused. No, all these episodes of global chaos occurred in 2022, each one a rerun of previous events, but now with the threat they posed vastly multiplied in scale.\nThis year, some of the phantoms of the Trump era and the Covid-19 pandemic finally seemed to recede—only to make room for new threats and the return of ghosts of years past. The same dictators—Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un—who have long threatened the global order, their geographic neighbors, and their countries\u0027 own citizens. Fresher digital threats like India\u0027s slide into online repression, and brazen cybercriminals displaying more ruthlessness than ever. And then there were some vestiges of the Trump era that seemed to have hung on, such as one particularly loud and quixotic billionaire with a large, cultlike following, seemingly doing his best to singlehandedly corrupt social media.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nEvery year, WIRED assembles a list of the most dangerous people on the internet. For the first time since 2015, Donald Trump doesn\u0027t top this list. But there\u0027s no shortage of new sources of instability and disruption online. Here are our picks for 2022.\nSam Bankman-Fried\nFor its entire existence, the cryptocurrency world has been plagued with money laundering, theft, and scams, from Bitcoin-powered dark-web drug markets to billions of dollars stolen from crypto companies by rogue hackers. But one of the most dangerous players in the crypto economy, it seems, was hiding in plain sight. In the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, a poster boy for cryptocurrency’s growing legitimacy, Sam Bankman-Fried, now stands accused of more than $8 billion in fraud. The rippling fallout for the cryptocurrency economy could be far larger, and the tangled dealings and mismanagement of user funds in FTX\u0027s meltdown have yet to be fully unraveled—even the company\u0027s new CEO John Ray, who also handled the bankruptcy of Enron, says he\u0027s never seen a bigger mess. Under Bankman-Fried\u0027s hands-on leadership, FTX invested vast sums of users\u0027 cryptocurrency in his own trading platform Alameda Research, which has also gone bankrupt. Aside from those enormous losses, Bankman-Fried represents a particularly troubling figure for the ills of the crypto economy: Unlike so many others in the crypto world, he had appeared to actually welcome tighter government controls of the industry. Now, like a hybrid of Elizabeth Holmes and Lehman Brothers, he\u0027s come to represent the face of regulatory capture.\nElon Musk\nThe antics of Elon Musk, as a Willy Wonka figure with his mercuriality dialed up to 11, seemed harmless enough—or possibly even a net good for human progress—when he was focused on next-generation rockets and electric cars. But with his acquisition of Twitter, the dark side of Musk was put on display, and the fickle power of the (sometimes) world\u0027s richest man suddenly threatened a central institution of the internet. Musk\u0027s immediate, summary layoffs of thousands of Twitter\u0027s staffers put at risk key functions of a service that serves as a central artery of digital conversation. Sure, he justified lifting Twitter\u0027s ban on neo-Nazis like Andrew Anglin as well as former president Donald Trump (after the latter was removed from Twitter after using it to incite the January 6 riots and invasion of the US Capitol building) with free speech arguments. But Twitter\u0027s new emperor has also decimated its staff of content moderators, leading to situations like a single staffer being left to police child abuse content on Twitter for all of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. Under Musk\u0027s watch, Twitter has also banned left-wing accounts he described as \"antifa,\" contradicting his stance on free speech. Just days after the acquisition, Musk briefly tweeted—then deleted—disinformation that the man who attacked US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband in October was his gay lover. Later, he seemed to call for the prosecution of the White House’s chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, without explanation. In doing so, he offered a glimpse of the conspiracy-minded politics and trolling that truly drive his actions. Twitter hasn\u0027t collapsed under Musk, as some of its doomsayers predicted. But it may be morphing into the worst version of itself.\nXi Jinping\nXi Jinping has presided over some of China\u0027s worst human rights abuses, including its mass internment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and the crackdown on protestors in Hong Kong. Each of those waves of repression has come with its own accompanying tightening of restrictions online, as censors scoured social media for any reference to protests and Han Chinese police in Xinjiang even demanded that Uyghurs download an app that scans their phones for banned content. This year, the protests against China\u0027s draconian zero-Covid lockdowns have triggered a new online crackdown, one in which even \"liking\" a post about protests is deemed illegal and signs of misbehavior are tracked in a regulated \"credit system\" that can lead to users being summarily banned from online platforms. Xi has already established himself as the most powerful figure in China\u0027s government in decades, taking an unprecedented third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party. He\u0027s made clear that authoritarian power will extend deep into the digital lives of the world\u0027s biggest population of internet users.\nNarendra Modi\nUnder Modi and his party, the BJP, India has become increasingly China-like in its repression of protests both physical and digital. In just the past few years, the Indian government temporarily shut down the internet in the embattled region of Kashmir, banned a large collection of China-based apps including TikTok, and just weeks ago delegated oversight of content moderation decisions on social media to a three-person group—a move widely seen as the latest step in the government\u0027s attempts to tighten its grip on those platforms. In perhaps the most appalling case of digital repression, security researchers this year revealed that hackers who fabricated evidence on the computers of activists in the region near the city of Pune had ties to the very same Pune police who arrested those activists. One of the activists targeted in that frame job died in detention. Eleven other defendants in the case remain in jail. Modi\u0027s India has proven that even a so-called democracy offers no guarantees of a remotely free internet.\nGRU\nRussia\u0027s GRU military intelligence agency has, for years, been home to some of the most aggressive and dangerous hackers in the world. The GRU groups known as Sandworm and APT28 have, in just the past seven years, triggered two blackouts in Ukraine, launched the hack-and-leak operation designed to sway the US 2016 election, released the NotPetya malware that spread worldwide and caused at least $10 billion in damage, and tried to destroy the backend of the 2018 Olympics. In 2022, thanks to Russia\u0027s unprovoked and brutal war in Ukraine, the GRU\u0027s focus zeroed in again on the country that has long been Russia\u0027s favorite hacking victim. In 2022, it launched countless cyberattacks designed to destroy data on Ukrainian government and corporate networks, often in tandem with physical attacks carried out by the invasion forces. One GRU malware attack went so far as to disable communications to 5,000 wind turbines across Germany in a case of collateral damage reminiscent of NotPetya. The GRU\u0027s Sandworm hackers also attempted a third blackout attack in Ukraine, which—according to Ukraine\u0027s government at least—defenders managed to foil this time. A+ for continued wanton, reckless aggression. B- for execution.\nDeSnake\nWhen the dark-web market for drugs and hacked data known as AlphaBay was shut down in 2017 and its creator Alexandre Cazes was found dead in a Thai jail cell, it seemed the story of AlphaBay was over. Then, in the summer of last year, fully four years after that massive bust, AlphaBay relaunched under the command of its cofounder and Cazes\u0027 top lieutenant, known only as DeSnake. In the year-plus since then, DeSnake has dragged AlphaBay back to the top of the dark web\u0027s competing scrum of criminal markets. To his credit, he\u0027s set more rules for what can be sold on his black market than Cazes ever did, banning the sale of fentanyl and ransomware tools, for instance. But AlphaBay remains a bustling criminal bazaar for hard drugs and stolen data, and it may be harder to shut down than ever. DeSnake has implemented security upgrades to the site, such as allowing only the harder-to-trace cryptocurrency Monero instead of Bitcoin. And he also claims to be located in the former Soviet Union—potentially putting him far farther beyond the reach of law enforcement than his unlucky predecessor.\nLazarus\nIn 2022, North Korea continued to distinguish itself as the world\u0027s top perpetrator of state-sponsored cybercrime: Its government hackers continued to steal hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loot, largely in the form of cryptocurrency, from targets around the globe. That spree of burglaries actually seems to be escalating. According to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, North Korean thieves took in $840 million in the first five months of 2022 alone, more than the previous two years combined. Some $600 million of that came from just one heist. All of it goes toward funding one of the worst regimes in the world, with hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps and a tendency to fire missiles over its neighbors\u0027 heads.\nConti\nThe scourge of ransomware continued to plague the world in 2022, and no group illustrated that threat better than Conti. In the first months of the year, the group hit dozens of corporate and government targets. Most catastrophically, it launched a wave of crippling cyberattacks across Costa Rica, shutting down 27 government bodies and medical services there and leading to a national state of emergency. After Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine, Conti declared its full support for that war—a decision that led to one of its disgruntled members leaking a vast trove of the group\u0027s internal communications online. Conti has subsequently shut down, but likely only in name. Its hackers may have rebranded and splintered, but the chaos that is their business model will no doubt persist.\nLapsus$\nThe only thing more dangerous than a group of ruthless ransomware hackers is a group of ruthless ransomware hackers who are also teenagers. In December of 2021, Lapsus$ made its entrance onto the hacking scene with a cyberattack on the Brazilian Ministry of Health in the midst of its Covid-19 response. It\u0027s since carried out a spree of splashy, often nihilistic breaches of major tech firms including Uber, Okta, Rockstar Games, Nvidia, Microsoft, Samsung, and Vodafone. Last spring, British law enforcement arrested seven people suspected of being members of the group, all ages 16 to 21. Those arrests included Lapsus$\u0027s alleged 16-year-old \"mastermind.\" But inexplicably, those suspects were released without charges, and the group\u0027s \"hacker joyride\" rolls on.\nAPT41\nFor years, China\u0027s hackers focused on by-the-book espionage. But more recently, one group, known as APT41, has proven itself to be the closest thing China has to North Korean state-sponsored cybercriminals. That group, which the US Department of Justice tied in an indictment to the Ministry of State Security contractor known as Chengdu 404, has for years moonlighted as a for-profit cybercriminal outfit. Just this month, the group was linked to the theft of $20 million in Covid-19 relief funds, an unprecedented robbery of US government money by a Chinese state-sponsored hacking outfit. Meanwhile, APT41 was also responsible for dozens of espionage-focused intrusions across the world this year, according to analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which calls the group the most prolific cyberspying operation in the world. Despite the Justice Department charging seven of the group\u0027s members in 2020, they remain at large, and their unique blend of espionage and outright theft continues unabated.","tags":["","HACKING","SECURITY","RUSSIA","RANSOMWARE","BITCOIN","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED","ELON MUSK"],"author":"BY WIRED STAFF","creation_date":"2022-12-26"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-year-the-nft-died-and-came-back-to-life/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The market for non-fungible tokens took a nosedive this year.

Using his quant and coding skills instead of a bow-and-arrow, he built, at breakneck speed, a $32 billion empire: the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, and the trading firm Alameda Research. But it was all supposedly for the cause of giving to the poor (via the fashionable new movement, effective altruism)—with former Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison acting as his Maid Marian and a stunning roster of A-listers (from top Democrats to star sportspersons) his Merry Men. Yet, since being escorted out of his Caribbean home in handcuffs on December 12, he has appeared a distinctly less cheerful outlaw. \nSo how did our self-proclaimed modern-day Robin Hood, who agreed to extradition to the US earlier this week, come to end up in chains? \nThe answer is foreshadowed by another “ethical crusader” who, a little over a decade ago, experimented with his own philanthropic fantasy on the other side of the globe: Vikram Akula and his microfinance initiative. Microfinance refers to institutions that provide financial services, especially small (“micro”) loans, to people not normally able to access credit from conventional banks—typically poor women, often in rural areas. The concept of microfinance, and the first microfinance institution, the Grameen Bank, had been established in the 1970s by economist Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh and had gradually grown to boast millions of borrowers in the country and all over the world—winning Yunus and his not-for-profit bank the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for contributions to global poverty eradication. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nMemory Champion Answers Questions From Twitter\nAkula, raised in the US, wanted to import the business acumen he’d acquired as a management consultant at McKinsey—his equivalent of Robin Hood’s archery—to the microfinance model in his ancestral homeland, India: specifically, by speeding the process up to bring the logic of fast-scaling consumer brands, like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s, into play. He established his own company, SKS Microfinance, in 1997 to do so. Fueled by the idea that the more rapidly Akula’s company expanded, the more good it could do, SKS quickly became one of the fastest growing institutions in the sector’s history, and Akula the bold new global face of microfinance—making, for instance, the Time magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People of 2006. By 2010, an SKS IPO, as apparent proof of the pudding of profit-with-a-purpose, was 14-times oversubscribed. \nSUBSCRIBE\nSubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\nThe similarities between FTX and SKS go beyond the rebel-with-a-cause personal trajectories of their founders. Like Robin Hood and his followers’ noble cat-and-mouse game with the tyrannical Sheriff, both men operated on the fringes of the law in the liminal extralegal space between legal and not, with SBF working in the unregulated crypto industry and Akula in the mostly unregulated South Asian microfinance sector. (In 2010, Akula, too, had an arrest warrant issued against him, although with “sheriffs” in India being what they are, he was never arrested.) And both were motivated, notionally—much as “man of the people” Robin Hood—by the democratizing zeal of giving power to the people. \nIndeed, the original models of crypto and microfinance had much in common. Crypto is a decentralized digital currency (including, for instance, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, and Dogecoin) traded on crypto exchanges (like Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and, until recently, FTX, as well as some brokerage platforms like Robinhood, Webull, and eToro). Unlike conventional “fiat currencies” issued by governments, crypto isn’t backed by any physical assets: Its value is conjured entirely by common consent. Because transactions (“blocks”) are verified and recorded (in a continuous link, or “chain”) in code known as a blockchain—the equivalent of a checkbook distributed across an infinity of computers across the world—it is considered open, diffuse, and consensus-driven: the ultimate peoples’ ledger, or an opportunity for millions of ordinary people to co-author their own collective financial story.\nThe microfinance model, on the other hand, is notable for providing loans without either contracts or collateral, but instead through “group lending” or organizing borrowers into supportive peer groups, usually of five—significantly widening the radius of finance by allowing virtually anyone (even those without legal or financial assets) to access credit, making it the quintessential people’s bank. Despite the absence of the usual punitive mechanisms, and, again, lending backed by physical assets (collateral), microfinance institutions remarkably achieve and maintain extremely high repayment rates—regularly over 95 percent, reportedly—by means of consensus or common consent among borrowers. At the heart of both are peer-to-peer relationships and dynamics that replace finance’s traditional hierarchies, akin to Robin Hood’s commitment to redistribution as financial justice. Cryptocurrency and microfinance—cousin experiments in decentralized and inclusive finance, respectively—challenge top-down institutions like banks and governments by not only drawing ordinary people into its remit but also, in theory, placing them at the wheel (the community “verifies” transactions in the crypto model and monitors lending via “peer-monitoring” in microfinance). Despite their many detractors, they succeeded in defying conventional wisdom to become multibillion-dollar industries, receiving the blessings and backing of some of the world’s most highly respected investors. Each, in turn, was anointed by reference venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, established by “godfather” of Silicon Valley Don Valentine.\nAnd in both instances, actors once deemed its “golden boys” almost single-handedly destabilized the prospects of the entire sector, demonstrating their frailty. The hubris of both FTX and SKS in developing highly streamlined versions of their products was that they were working with a universal scaling formula—a mechanical substitute for trust—allowing for infinitely rapid growth. Indeed, Satoshi Nakamoto, in outlining the proposal for the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin—speculated to be in part a response to the excesses of the 2008 financial crisis—explicitly described the technology as being “based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” Similarly, Akula set out to develop what he referred to as the “Starbucks version” of microfinance. FTX derived its confidence from the halo-effect of blockchain code being deemed incorruptible while SKS operated on the assumption that the signature high repayment rates of microfinance were based on a cold, economic cost-benefit analysis on the part of borrowers. \nThey were wrong.\nAs the Nobel Prize–winning economist and high priestess of informality Elinor Ostrom established, the peer-to-peer mechanisms at the core of both models can be highly resilient. But their success lies in their communitarian calculus (relationships of trust and reciprocity between participants and the institution), which makes participants feel invested. Social identity was a key part of what made both crypto and microfinance work. Women in India—like their 15 or so million compatriots in Bangladesh—paid their loans back largely because that’s what it meant to belong. One in five Americans report having traded cryptocurrency, with 33 percent of those in crypto circles citing “wanting to be a part of a community” as at least a minor reason for investing. The secret ingredient that congeals any institution—but especially an informal one, like Robin Hood and his band—is solidarity within the group and faith in the morality of its mission: in these cases, correctives to the injustices of mainstream finance. SBF and Akula understood IT and business, but not the technology of trust. \nIn the early 2000s, Joseph Stiglitz (another Nobel Prize–winning economist) and I detected the incipient “irrational exuberance” in the microfinance sector and predicted that the bubble was likely to burst on the basis that SKS was undermining the very thing that had made microfinance tick—trust—by “mass manufacturing” it at a pace and profit margin that crowded out the moral incentives of borrowers. In November 2010, anticipating events 12 years later at FTX, this played out: Soon after its explosive burst of growth, SKS faced a wave of defections in the form of mass defaults—an unhappy first in the industry’s history. Regulators, who had struggled to keep up with the novel developments of the sector, scrambled to take action, introducing draconian legislation. And so Akula’s experiment ended up in the “sheriff’s” shackles after all. The lasting legacy of the Indian microfinance crisis, barely reported in the international media, was 10 million women being designated defaulters and denied access to credit in the future, potentially for the rest of their lives. Those handed the tab for Akula’s great gamble were the very people in whose name he acted: the common person. Meanwhile, this November, a tweet by the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, prompted a run on FTT, the FTX token, ultimately exposing the rot at the core of the organization and revealing an $8-billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet, potentially leaving 1 million of its customers—ordinary people—once again holding the bill. \nSKS changed microfinance irrevocably, shattering the fragile equilibrium of goodwill that long sustained it. FTX, for better or for worse, promises to do the same for the crypto industry. In light of corporate restructuring expert and Enron veteran John Jay Ray III’s testimony before the US House of Representatives on Bankman-Fried’s Bernie Madoff–style “old-fashioned embezzlement,” SBF is starting to look less like a heroic outlaw and more like a garden-variety bandit. But from the FTX scandal—which is likely to join the ranks of “one of the biggest frauds in American financial history”—to the SKS debacle, one of the biggest mass defaults in history, the lesson is clear: The key thing about a people’s institution is that you have to retain the trust of the people. Otherwise, one goes from being Robin Hood to, at best, the prince of thieves.","tags":["","CRYPTO","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","MONEY","PSYCHOLOGY","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"],"author":"BY ANTARA HALDAR","creation_date":"2022-12-21"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/digital-nomad-village-madeira-portugal/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"A Portuguese island created a village for remote workers, promising community to the newcomers and prosperity to the locals—then delivered on neither.","title":"Welcome to Digital Nomadland","detailed_content":"SEEN FROM AFAR, the parish of Ponta do Sol looks as compact and picturesque as a postcard. There’s a small roundabout at the center, a gas station, a tiny shopping complex, and a cluster of modest buildings topped by terra-cotta roof tiles. Rippling green slopes of banana, palm, and pine fan out behind, houses dotted among the hills. All of this is surrounded by dramatic escarpment and made subtropically lush by the many small waterfalls that gurgle from the rock face, filling centuries-old irrigation canals. When Gonçalo Hall first drove through the area in September 2020, the words that came into his mind were: “What the fuck is this?”\nPonta do Sol is on the southern coast of Madeira, the main island of the Portuguese archipelago of the same name. Hall had visited Madeira once as a kid, but he didn’t remember it being so beautiful, so wild. Now, as he put it in an interview, he was seeing the place “with the eyes of a digital nomad.” He had returned to help run a conference about remote work in Madeira’s regional capital, Funchal. The day after his long drive through the countryside, he approached the regional secretary of economy and asked point-blank: Why are you sleeping on digital nomads?\nHall, 35, is tall and husky, with blond hair, blue eyes, a jovial demeanor, and a proclivity for speaking in hashtag mantras like “life is good” or “be happy, make millions.” He grew up in Lapa, the poshest area of Lisbon, but now keeps an apartment in Ponta do Sol with his wife, Catarina: Lisbon, he complained when we first met, had become too much of a melting pot. Hall had long dreamed of finding a lifestyle where he could show up to work in flip-flops and shorts rather than the suits and ties of the bankers in his family. In early 2019, the couple moved to Bali for two months, where Hall picked up his first remote contracts, including a marketing gig for a firm called Remote-how, and amassed a hefty contact list in the process. Then they went to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Bali again, spending a month or two in each before returning to Europe.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nBack in Lisbon, after less than a year of the digital nomad lifestyle, Hall was organizing conferences about remote work and digital nomadism, self-identifying as an expert on both. When he landed in Madeira, he took in its low cost of living, fast internet speeds, surfable beaches, and Instagrammable beauty—the pillars of digital nomad marketing. He recognized something else as well in the pastoral pace. A small nomad project that he had visited in rural Spain, just before his arrival in the archipelago, had impressed him; it was charming, more intimate than the bustling urban hubs he had experienced so far.\nEstablished digital nomad hot spots, like Chiang Mai, Thailand, or Canggu, Bali, tend to be bubbles where wealthy and overwhelmingly white foreigners cluster at coffee shops, coworking spaces, and other businesses that cater to their wants and comforts in English. If he built a destination for digital nomads in small-town Madeira, Hall thought, things would be different. Itinerant remote workers could live just like locals, alongside locals: They could reside in the same neighborhoods, eat at the same restaurants, and mingle at gatherings coordinated by a “community manager.” Hall decided to pitch his idea to the Madeiran government.\nIt was an easy sell. Tourism in the archipelago had plummeted due to the Covid-19 travel bans that had barred travelers from outside of Europe’s Schengen Area, and so Hall framed digital nomads as the cure. Portugal’s urban centers were already saturated with remote workers, but Madeira, less than a two-hour flight from Lisbon, was still under the radar. High-earning professionals could pour money into local businesses, Hall told regional officials. All they needed to welcome them was an inviting infrastructure and a ready-made network to land in. If he built it, Hall promised, they would come. A meeting was arranged with Madeira’s regional president, Miguel Albuquerque, and “after two or three beers,” Albuquerque recalled later, “the deal was sealed.” StartUp Madeira, a regional business incubator, was enrolled to manage the project, Hall was hired to lead, and the coastal parish of Ponta do Sol, population 4,300, was selected as the location for an experiment that looked a little bit like tourism, a little bit like a future-of-work demo, a little bit like selective immigration—and a lot like a test for a strained local housing market. The project was perhaps an inevitable extension of mainland Portugal’s eager embrace of foreign remote workers, itself part of a global expansion of digital-nomad-friendly legislation and of the private industries attending to their needs. It was ironic, in a way: While the pandemic had closed borders for so many, it had created financial incentives to open them to others. \nWHEN THE DIGITAL Nomad Village officially launched in February 2021, there were a small handful of inaugural residents. They included Kamil Kokot, a Polish software developer; his sister; two German men they’d arranged to rent a house with via Slack; and Hall himself. There was a local 7 pm curfew then, but after months of being grounded by Covid, the newcomers were thrilled to be in a new place among new people. By spring, the Village had swelled to 50, and Kokot felt he had begun to make a tight-knit group of friends. They threw him a surprise birthday party in May, then celebrated out-of-season Christmas, Halloween, and New Year’s Eve together in the weeks that followed. They set off fireworks on the beach just before curfew one warm spring night, giddily sipping on champagne while bewildered residents of Ponta do Sol watched from their homes. At the end of June, a group of these newfound friends traveled to the Azores for a happy holiday together, then scattered. Some, like Kokot, returned the following winter. Madeira, he told me, was the first place outside Poland where he could imagine making a home.\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERSBy the time I visited in February 2022, the pilot project was a year old. An estimated 200 international remote workers were staying in rentals in the Ponta do Sol parish and larger municipality. At least 1,000 more had snapped up rooms, apartments, and villas elsewhere on the island—in some cases because the stock had been exhausted or priced too high in Ponta do Sol. Many came through town to cowork or attend the yoga classes, workshops, and other events that pack the Digital Nomad Village’s calendar.\nThe ocean views from the outdoor workspace are stunning, but even in the shade, it’s often too bright to see your screen.\nOne of those events, a weekly “community lunch,” is held every Wednesday at a restaurant near the coworking space. The day I joined, some 30-odd remote workers gathered at Steak \u0026 Sun, where the kitchen staff have learned to make vegetarian and vegan dishes for their new clientele. Submitting a 🐠 on a Slack post claimed an order of bacalhau a bras, a non-alcoholic beverage, and an espresso for €9. At my table were Hall and his wife, an arts administrator from Lithuania, a startup cofounder from the UK, several software developers from Germany, and one from Scotland.\nMelissa and João Cabral, siblings from Calheta, the next town over, approached the group and introduced themselves in English. “We’re locals,” Melissa said, “would it be OK if we joined?” The people seated around me let out an enthusiastic yes, motioning for them to sit, sit, please sit. As the siblings settled into their seats, Hall announced that they were the very first locals to join community lunch. The Cabrals couldn’t hide their surprise.\nBoth Cabrals were in marketing and worked remotely. They had visited the coworking space that morning, when Hall told them about the lunch. Melissa was initially hesitant. “You see the word ‘digital nomads’ so you think, ‘it’s not for us,’” she said, a sentiment later echoed by several other locals I spoke with. But she was a remote worker in Madeira too, and networking with entrepreneurs and people with international connections could be useful, so she decided to come. Melissa posed a question to the table: “Do you think it’s important to connect with locals?” Hall responded with a quick and firm yes, absolutely. That would be the next phase of the project, he said. Covid, he offered, had so far made it impossible.\nThe siblings later told me that they were floored by the warm reception. A cluster of curious travelers surrounded them after lunch, asking questions, extending dinner invitations, encouraging them to use the coworking space, and insisting that they return. They said they would. Still, Melissa said, if she and her brother were the first locals to join, then clearly “something is not working that well.”\nTHE DIGITAL NOMAD Village is not a physical village, of course. It is a marketing pitch and a virtual infrastructure that facilitates the mutual interaction of international remote workers, superimposed and dependent on the actual, centuries-old village of Ponta do Sol. The closest the Digital Nomad Village has to a physical structure is the free coworking space, an area on loan at the John Dos Passos Cultural Center, one of the few modern buildings in town. Downstairs, locals meet up for film screenings, dance rehearsals, and photo exhibitions. Upstairs, foreign remote workers gather to gaze at their laptops and take Zoom meetings in the courtyard. On my visits, I noticed that the desks inside were always claimed first: The ocean views from the outdoor workspace are stunning, but even in the shade, it’s often too bright to see your screen.Very few people I met in the Village embraced the term “digital nomad.” The label is taken up most enthusiastically by those who make their money off it. In this definition, digital nomads are freelancers and entrepreneurs who explore the world, untethered to corporate offices, long apartment leases, and car payments, and who stay for weeks or months or longer—just not long enough to be liable to pay taxes. In Portugal, the lines that divide digital nomads from foreign remote workers from expats from immigrants from working holidayers are often fuzzed: Portuguese officials don’t hide their desire to transform this particular class of wanderers into settlers.\nThe national government has so far had very little basis for guessing how many itinerant remote workers pass through the country each year, where they come from, what they do, how long they stay, how they live, or even what measurable impact or contributions they make to the broader economy or social life of the country. StartUp Madeira started compiling its own statistics after the launch of the Digital Nomad Village experiment, counting the arrival of more than 8,000 remote workers to the archipelago so far—but that’s still little more than an estimate, and likely a low one. The numbers are based solely on the number of people who register through StartUp Madeira\u0027s website.\nPonta do Sol is sold as a place you can call home, while ushering in the displacement of the people who have called it home for generations.\nThe Madeira Islands Slack, the virtual dimension of the Nomad Village, is by turns awkward, dull, and chaotic. Nomads who work as coaches regularly offer circles and paid workshops for breath work, bodywork, shadow work, heart opening, and chakra meditation. I saw advertisements for a photo-hiking workshop to shoot models in the forest, a combination photoshoot-therapy session in the mountains, and an NFT-themed connection retreat for women. Every week a new flyer announces the DJ lineup for Purple Friday, a raucous party at a cliffside hotel that keeps separate invite lists for international and local guests. (“Madeira,” Kokot told me, “was the first place for me to have party social fatigue.”)\nAfter the community lunch I attended, the Scotsman tagged all 6,000-plus Slack users in a note asking who was up for a coffee, inviting an intercontinental pile-on. A year into the project, the few pinned posts were outdated, leaving a gaping blank where documentation or collective memory should have gone. A central FAQ was posted more recently, but for the first year and a half the same questions were posted again and again: Does anyone know of a room to rent? Is there a bus to Funchal? Where do I rent a car? How do I book a desk at the coworking space? Any recommendations for vegan food? How can I find an apartment? Hey, anyone know if there’s a bus to Funchal?\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERSSeveral of the temporary residents of Ponta do Sol told me they’d looked forward to the Digital Nomad Village’s potential for small-town community but were disappointed after they arrived by how little meaningful interaction there was with Madeirans. They tried to find their own ways to seek out connection with locals: getting to know café and restaurant staff by name, riding public transportation, volunteering at the dog shelter, learning Portuguese, joining pickup soccer games. Some contemplated settling in Madeira longer term. A couple of them initiated meetups with Madeiran social entrepreneurs. But these were outliers.\nDespite Hall’s stated intentions, the design of the Village, the itinerant core of its lifestyle, and the consequences of bringing in so many people so quickly have made the promised “community” complicated to deliver. StartUp Madeira’s promotional video for the project sells Ponta do Sol as a place you can call home—a shallow vision of belonging that demands no commitments and carries no burden or history—all while ushering in the displacement of the people who have called it home for generations before your arrival. In this telling, guests don’t owe their hosts a thing. It is a familiar story.\nIN THE 15TH century, when the Portuguese first landed on Madeira’s shores, the island was uninhabited by humans, thick with forest cover, and abundant with life. The conquistadors didn’t name Madeira after what they saw growing there: trees, green, woods, forest, jungle—árvores, verde, bosque, floresta, selva. They named it after the commodity those trees could become once they were razed: wood, timber, lumber—madeira, madeira, madeira. Fires were set to clear land for settlement and cash crop agriculture, burning for seven years straight, as the legend goes.\nMany of Ponta do Sol’s residents still work in agriculture; sugarcane has been grown here from its earliest settlement, though banana cultivation now dominates. People here are, on average, poorer than the rest of the island, which is itself poorer than the rest of Portugal, the poorest country in southwestern Europe. During my visit, I perused an exhibition at the John Dos Passos Cultural Center featuring photos taken during the miserable four-decade-long Estado Novo dictatorship: dirt roads, shoeless peasants, grass-thatched huts, aching poverty. When the colony of Madeira won its autonomy in 1975, after the fall of the fascist regime, 60 percent of the archipelago’s population was illiterate.\nMadeira has built a robust tourism industry in the decades since. Most of the bookable beds in Ponta do Sol are in private homes called “Alojamento Local,” which are subject to different regulations than the long-term rentals sought by locals, and exponentially more profitable. Hall says he wants 100 beds in the area to be secured exclusively for digital nomad rentals, and he and his business partner Dave Williams are trying to incentivize property owners—including the growing numbers of foreigners who have invested in real estate here—to jump on board.\nWilliams, who started NomadX, originally a midterm accommodations business, with help from StartUp Lisbon, now partners with Airbnb rival Flatio. I attended one of the Flatio info sessions Hall and Williams cohosted for prospective landlords—held entirely in English—where Hall waxed on about the desirable demographic profile of these medium-term tenants: young, high-paid, driven, and fit. To illustrate his point, he cajoled Funchal’s community manager into performing burpees. Ponta do Sol currently has the highest density of Alojamento Local homes on the island, tripling in recent years, and the intense demand from remote workers is driving residents to either reallocate existing rental and tourism properties to this market, or build more.Even on a casual tour through town, I saw construction everywhere. On a steep road that’s been nicknamed Nomad Street by foreigners, a build site advertises its final form on a placard: Platinum Villas VIII, all glass and sharp angles. High in the hills, I paused to chat with a local man working a sloped patch of garden. He put down the banana plant he’d been carrying on his shoulder and told me he’d just come from his day job in construction. He worked on a property owned by a wealthy American who’d ordered the fruit plantation next to his house razed to make space for new rental apartments. The man had rescued as many trees as he could, to replant on his own plot.\nMadeiran residents now pay among the highest percentage of their salary on rent in Portugal. \nLocal government representatives assured me that the itinerant young workers attracted by the Digital Nomad Village were valuable and welcome additions to the region. But when I talked to João Campanário, Ponta do Sol’s parish council president, he told me he had never actually met one. Not even Hall had stopped by to introduce himself before installing a coworking space across the street from his office. Still, he said, “we’d like them to stay here.”\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERS\nCélia Pessegueiro, the head of Ponta do Sol’s municipal council, described the arrival of digital nomads during the pandemic as “a kind of ray of sunshine in the middle of a cloudy day.” After the streets had been so quiet for months, there was a certain joy in spotting young people in backpacks and sandals wandering, dazed, through the tiny village.\nHall praised the regional president, Albuquerque, as a politician who “thinks like a CEO”—where others see an empty building, he sees opportunity for investment. Hall described his relationship with Pessegueiro as friendly but confided that he was disappointed by the lack of similar thinking on her part. Though he had hardly engaged the municipal and parish governments at any level of planning, he felt he was not being supported. (For instance, he had asked Pessegueiro to install workout equipment by the beach. “There’s no room,” she explained, seeming surprised.)When I brought this up with Pessegueiro, she paused and chose her words carefully. “This place is ready to receive visitors and new residents,” she said. “I want them to feel like they’re coming to a place where there are people living already, and to live well with them. I don’t want the people who are from here to feel excluded in any way.”\nHousing is one area where exclusion has been most sharply felt. The price of homes in Ponta do Sol has jumped 30 percent in the past year, and the rental stock in Madeira has dropped by 42 percent in approximately the same period. Nearly two-thirds of the apartments on offer were priced over €1,000—in a region where the monthly minimum wage is €723. In Funchal, rents are even higher: The small city is second only to Lisbon in lack of affordability. Madeiran residents now pay among the highest percentage of their salary on rent in the country. \nMadeira also has the highest density of social housing in Portugal, double the national average. Five thousand families are on the waiting list for housing support, and the regional government’s response has been to announce the construction of housing units that are even more affordable. Edgar Silva, an opposition politician in Funchal, has publicly lamented how the city’s working-class heart is being gutted. In a local news outlet, he blasted what he called “a perverse mechanism of social segregation,” as unfettered price increases push more and more locals to the periphery.\nPessegueiro had visited Lisbon recently and observed how its most iconic neighborhoods had been emptied of their residents—drained of the living memory of the capital’s historic center. To protect the character of her own town, she outlined community-rooted solutions: supporting families with renovations of old properties, the recuperation of abandoned houses, building homes on inherited land. “The question of housing support is fundamental to keep people here, so that they don’t feel like they’re being forced out of their homes,” she told me. “That’s the balance.”\nLISBON IS A case study for how a sweeping invitation to the world—at least, to the parts of the world with money and relaxed visa agreements—can look like a rousing success and a catastrophe at the same time, depending on what you measure. Following a devastating economic meltdown in 2008 that left 40 percent of millennials unemployed, Portugal’s government introduced two measures to attract foreign investment: the Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) tax scheme in 2009, and the Golden Visa program in 2012. Portuguese people earn among the lowest salaries in Europe, work some of the longest hours, and pay some of the highest income taxes. A local who earns the average monthly wage of €1,500 loses nearly a third of it to tax, with the sliding scale topping out at 48 percent for annual salaries above €75,000. By contrast, a foreign resident who qualifies for the NHR scheme pays a flat tax of 20 percent for 10 years. The Golden Visa program, meanwhile, had been billed as a pathway to job creation, fast-tracking citizenship in exchange for an investment of at least €250,000. An audit last year found that more than 90 percent of all visas issued in the past nine years were for a real estate purchase. \nIn the past year, Lisbon has earned the dubious distinction of being ranked the third most financially unliveable city in the world.\nThis year the investment requirement was increased, and a restriction imposed on Golden Visa residential real estate purchases in Lisbon, Porto, and Portugal’s coastal region. There are no such restrictions in Madeira, however, which is autonomously governed. Madeira also has its own tax scheme to attract foreign investment, in particular a highly competitive 5 percent corporate rate. Multiple investigations by the European Commission found Madeira’s tax cuts were violating EU rules to illegally benefit companies, with no clear contribution to Madeirans, who experience the highest unemployment rate in the country. Many of the jobs these companies had claimed to create on the island were based either outside the region or outside the EU altogether, or even fabricated.\nPortugal has also sought to draw foreign spending via an aggressive tourism campaign. In 2022, the country brought in more money from tourism than in any year prior. This summer, the capital’s iconic electric tram 28 became utterly unusable as public transportation, due to the long lines of tourists eager for an Instagrammable ride. And while the government credits tourism for helping to reduce unemployment, the reality is that the bulk of those new service-oriented jobs are painfully precarious.The tourism boom and rampant real estate speculation has precipitated an ongoing evictions crisis in the capital, where renters receive patchwork legal protections. After a wave of evictions between 2014 and 2016, in which more than five households were evicted per day, the National Rental Desk reported in 2022 that evictions are on the rise once more, up 36 percent over the past year. Some activist groups say the number of illegal evictions carried out—including well-documented intimidation campaigns by owners against elderly tenants and the razing of informal housing—makes the scope of the crisis much larger. In the parish of Santa Maria Maior, where the historic neighborhoods of Alfama and Mouraria are located, 61 percent of homes are now registered as AL properties—meaning the majority of what were once family homes have been emptied of their residents. Earlier this year, the Lisbon city council put a freeze on new AL licenses, and in an extraordinary ruling, the country’s Supreme Court voted to restrict short- and medium-term rentals in residential buildings. Still, real estate speculation continues to wreak tremendous damage. In the past year, Lisbon has earned the dubious distinction of being ranked the third most financially unliveable city in the world, just behind London and just above Mexico City, another beleaguered digital nomad hot spot. \n“Friends tell me, ‘Lisbon suffered a perfect storm,’” Antonio Gori, a member of the housing rights collective Habita, told me. “But it wasn’t a storm. It’s the fruit of political decisions.”\nFor the past seven years, Ana Mendes Godinho, formerly the country’s secretary of state for tourism and now its minister of labor, solidarity, and social security, has set her sights on drawing temporary and long-stay foreign remote workers to Portugal. The relocation of Web Summit, a massive annual technology conference, to Lisbon in 2016 “was a very important turning point,” Godinho told me. She inaugurated dozens of coworking spaces in the interior of the country and expanded a financial incentive program to encourage relocation to the region—initially open only to citizens—to remote workers of any nationality. At last year’s Web Summit, she promised to personally reply to emails from remote workers who were interested, and in the weeks leading up to the 2022 summit, her government announced a new visa, widely referred to as a Digital Nomad Visa. (The visa is renewable for five years, the same amount of time necessary to become eligible for citizenship.) “We feel that this is the perfect moment, and we have the perfect conditions for digital nomads to choose Portugal for their lives,” Godinho told me.\nA common narrative employed by the champions of foreign remote workers is that Portugal needs people. Advocates cite underpopulated rural communities and point to the brain drain precipitated by the economic crisis, when millennials, the highest-educated generation in Portuguese history, left the country in droves. In both instances, most people left in search of employment; remote work, they argue, could solve all of that. Hall described his repopulation plan as a “funnel”: First draw the digital nomads, then entice the ones who will buy houses and settle. Pieter Levels, the proprietor of The Nomad List, one of the first sites dedicated to nomad hubs, recently launched a residency-consulting business for remote workers in Portugal. His sales pitch painted a portrait of a country “in dire need of foreigners to live, work, and spend money there to recover” and then went on to list the various ways you wouldn’t spend money there: 0 percent tax on income, 0 percent on crypto, 0 percent on dividends, 0 percent on wealth. StartUp Madeira has claimed that itinerant remote workers, as a whole, inject €1.5 million each month into the region. Immigrants, meanwhile, contributed €1.3 billion to the country’s social security fund last year. Yet so many of these foreign-born workers—particularly those from Brazil, Cape Verde, Angola, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Venezuela—are not received with the same fanfare. From discrimination and racist treatment to allegations of torture by the national guard, human trafficking, and outright slavery in the agricultural fields of the Alentejo, the distinctions between who is welcome and who isn’t couldn’t be starker. Just as Uber and Airbnb bypassed regulations by branding themselves as innovators of a “sharing economy,” the private and public hype around “digital nomads” makes an easy cover for propping up a hierarchy of migration.\nNearly every Madeiran I spoke with had something to say about their region’s sudden rise in popularity among remote work visitors and settlers. But Madeira is small. The uneasy memory of Portugal’s long dictatorship still lingers here; plus, everyone seemed to know someone who worked for the government or in tourism. Most asked that I keep their comments, even innocuous ones, off the record, or protect their identity: the teachers on their smoke break who balked at the nearly €1,700 rent foreigners were willing to pay at a new digital nomad hotel; the farmer who pointed out various foreign-owned rental properties on a nearby hill; the young doctor who loved the energy of the newcomers but lamented that it was all happening too fast; the woman in Funchal who laughed over how they had flooded Tinder, earning them the nickname “genital nomads.” \n“People say outright that they only want to rent to digital nomads,” one resident of a small town near Ponta do Sol complained. “It’s maybe the worst thing about this project.” Another described an American friend who had fled California because of the annual wildfires and was renting a rustic apartment in the hills above Ponta do Sol for €800—two or three times higher than it would have cost a few years ago, by her estimation. “Many of them are running away from something—from climate change, from real estate speculation, from Brexit,” she said. While her island was a refuge for them, she bemoaned that young Madeirans had nowhere left to flee—not Venezuela, not the UK, and certainly not the mainland.\nBeverly Yuen Thompson, a sociologist, describes these wandering remote workers as “canaries in the digital coal mine.” Despite the branded imagery of freedom, leisure, and good-vibes-only positivity—discussion of anything political, for example, was not allowed on the Madeira Slack channel—Thompson writes that the lifestyle is undergirded by uncertainty, inequality, and abandonment by both governments and workplaces. Digital nomads have “strong passports and resources,” she points out, “just not enough to live as comfortably in their own land as in someone else’s.”\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERSFor a sector that so loudly proclaims its devotion to quality of life, the failure of the global leaders in the digital nomad space to consider the losses of host communities is astounding to behold. It is as though those living communities don’t matter beyond the abstract role they fulfill as backdrop. Lumber, not trees. In April, a video circulated on social media of 50 police officers with their batons out in the streets of Beato, a rapidly gentrifying parish in eastern Lisbon, grabbing and striking a group of women and children who were protesting a mass eviction. A few weeks later, the massive Creative Hub of Beato on the waterfront, home to Lisbon’s newest “unicorn factory,” hosted a hackathon to find innovative solutions to the capital’s housing crisis. The winning answer: blockchain.\nWhen I spoke to some of the local architects of Portugal’s digital nomad boom—Hall, StartUp Madeira CEO Carlos Soares Lopes, minister Godinho, and tourism authority president Luís Araújo—earlier this year, they were either reluctant to acknowledge its impact on long-term residents, dismissed housing as a separate issue, or pointed to coliving as the solution. As harms have compounded, however, public criticism has become impossible to ignore. This fall, the Portuguese press documented a distressing shortage of student housing, with report after report of undergraduates dropping out or sleeping in pantries because 80 percent of the rooms that had long been available to them were rented out. In November, Portugal’s secretary of state for tourism at the time, Rita Marques, admitted that “we have been the victims of our own success, and that’s true for digital nomads and for tourism too.”\n“I like to say that 500 years ago, Portugal discovered the world by sea,” Godinho said, “so now we are being discovered in this digital world.”\nHall now concedes there is some “short-term pain” for locals but insists that the payoff will be worth it. Not long after the launch in Madeira, he began pitching the Digital Nomad Village model to governments elsewhere in Portugal, then in Cape Verde, and most recently in Brazil. He purchased the NomadX brand from Williams to act as an umbrella for his rapidly expanding roster of projects, and this summer he launched a nonprofit with his wife and their friends: the Digital Nomads Association Portugal. They promptly elected him president. He believes he can “fix” what’s wrong with each of these places using his model; maybe 10 years to fix Cape Verde, possibly a little longer to figure out Brazil.\nIN PONTA DO Sol, Melissa Cabral did return to the Digital Nomad Village. Some weeks after the group lunch, she got a call from StartUp Madeira, offering her a temporary part-time contract as community manager. She became the first Madeirense in charge of helping orient new arrivals, organizing events, and facilitating day-to-day functioning in Ponta do Sol. When she started in July, of all the people who’d enthusiastically received her at lunch five months earlier, only one remained. \nSign Up Today\nSign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.\nCabral reached out to her own local friends and contacts on the island, inviting them to events and to use the free coworking space, but soon found that many of them simply weren’t interested. Even her brother refused her offers of a ride to the coworking space, where she happily sets up shop each day—he preferred working from home. Perhaps, she mused, it was the fact that “the digital nomads were not really at home” that made the coworking space and constant events appealing to them. While she has felt energized working closely with the international visitors in Ponta do Sol these past few months, her perspective on bringing more locals into the Digital Nomad Village fold has changed. “They have different lifestyles,” she told me.\nI recalled a story Pessegueiro had shared with me about a public garden in the village. At first, plants were purchased from a greenhouse, but these quickly withered because they weren’t acclimated to the local conditions. But then, she told me, “people started giving us plants from their gardens.” This time, the garden flourished. Like the town, Pessegueiro emphasized, it could not be prepared and made beautiful only for the eyes and photographs of tourists.I spent my last afternoon in Ponta do Sol on a Slack-organized hike along the Levada do Moinho, one of the oldest irrigation canals in the area. We climbed Nomad Street, past a colorful parade of brightly painted houses fringed by lush flower gardens, and paused briefly at the top of the hill in the shadow of a large pink building, the Esmeraldo house. In the 1400s, Flemish sugar baron João Esmeraldo presided over a vast, profitable sugarcane plantation from up here.\nPortuguese politicians often draw parallels between the country’s current popularity and its past glories. Disappointingly, the version of history they present is divorced from its brutal reality, emptied of any lessons it could possibly impart. “Just as it was in the 15th century,” Rui Miguel Barreto, Madeira’s secretary of economy, said in a speech earlier this year, “Madeira can become a gateway, a platform for development, for business on a global scale.” When we spoke on Zoom, Godinho called it “another time of discovery,” without a trace of irony. “I like to say that 500 years ago, Portugal discovered the world by sea,” she continued, “so now we are being discovered in this digital world.”\nThe island colony of Madeira experienced the world’s most spectacular cash crop boom in the 15th century, followed by an epic crash a few decades later as its sugar economy collapsed alongside the deforestation that fueled such rapacious expansion. This capitalist pilot project, environmental historian Jason W. Moore has noted, was cosmopolitan from the start. Settlers from mainland Portugal hauled timber and planted cane while enslaved people trafficked from the Canary Islands and the African coast took on the dangerous work of building mountainside irrigation canals, and bankers and traders from Flanders and Genoa circulated the product and profits. This included João Esmeraldo’s dear friend Christopher Columbus, who pivoted from the sugar business to maritime exploration during his time in the archipelago.\nMadeira was an early testing ground for the slavery-based island plantation economy, a place named by some scholars as the birthplace of global racial capitalism. But on my visit, I did not see any outward trace of this explosive role in history. Even in Funchal, at the sugar museum that doubles as a monument to Columbus, I did not find a single use of the words “enslaved,” “slave,” “slavery,” or “exploitation.” A few minutes away, in the harbor, a replica of Columbus’ ship the Santa Maria takes visitors on twice-daily tours along the southern coast. For €35, the tour company promises, you too can feel exactly how this great discoverer felt, exploring new corners of the world.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

BCG X Breaks Down How Companies Should Think About Technology","detailed_content":"THE NEED FOR digital transformation has defined American industry for decades. But with technology advancing faster than ever before, enterprises across the world are finding it harder and harder to bring that goal to scale. Sylvain Duranton, a global lead at BCG X—Boston Consulting Group’s new tech build and design unit—has an idea of what can get today’s organizations back on track. \nWIRED Brand Lab:\nLet\u0027s start broadly, shall we? What kind of impact do you think today\u0027s large organizations are seeing from their digital investments over the last 10 years? Are they paying off? Or is that still TBD? \nSylvain Duranton:\nI think there\u0027s quite a gap between the hype and reality. We have corporate data on that; out of those who are really pushing digital transformation, only 30 percent of companies are starting to see some real financial impact through their transformation effort.\nIn this 30 percent, a small subset is seeing massive impact or several percentage points of incremental EBIDTA, or they’re gaining a much stronger competitive position. Others are making some incremental impact. But all in all, although everyone is talking about digital transformation, it’s had a positive impact in only 30 percent of cases.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nWhy is that number so low? What is holding 70 percent of companies back from seeing impact?\nDuranton:\nIf you ask most companies, \"Did you tick the box of using AI?\" They would say yes. Same with, \"Did you tick the box of having a center of expertise?\" Yes. “Did you tick the box of recruiting new talent?” Yes. The list goes on. Many boxes have been ticked and money has been spent. But if you ask C-suite members, \"What are the three massively disruptive things that you have at scale that have made a difference on your market or customers?\" Then the answer is not so easy. \nThe main challenge has been to scale: Many companies have done many things, but very few have scaled in the end. The promise is still there, but that promise has not yet materialized. Typically, what we see is lots of small initiatives—thousands of flowers blooming at one company, because everyone wants to do a bit of digital somewhere in the company. And in the end, the company is diluting the investment.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nIsn’t that diversification a good thing, though? Isn’t it safer to seed a variety of digital efforts, as opposed to just one or two?\nDuranton:\nThat approach often ignores how challenging true change is. I think the fundamental mistake is that companies underestimate how much change is needed to derive value from technology versus just implementing technology. I think 10 percent of the effort needed is after building a disruptive technology itself; another 20 percent of the effort will be spent integrating this technology into your legacy technology. \nThe remaining 70 percent of the effort lies in changing the organization and its processes and ways of working. If you just want to automate something simple, then okay, you don\u0027t need to change the way the company works. But if you use AI to make or support business decisions, then that could mean different teams, different people, and different processes. You might have to completely change the way people work, and that\u0027s very hard. Many companies think it\u0027s all about building a new technology: They focus on the 10 percent of the work, and they don\u0027t do the full 100 percent. This is why we don\u0027t see those technologies at scale as much as society thinks we should.WIRED Brand Lab:\nDo you think a lot of companies fundamentally don\u0027t understand that, or do you think they avoid that deeper effort? \nDuranton:\nI think they underestimate the amount of change required. Most can only do it on a few very big topics within the organization. Many companies have launched too many things and cannot invest enough in each of them. \nIt\u0027s like taking a rocket to space. To get off the ground, you need massive amounts of energy. I think the best way to allocate this (organizational) energy is on just two or three big things that will make a real difference. If you aren’t focused, you don\u0027t get any meaningful results, and then people start to lose patience. Once you\u0027ve completed a few of those builds, you\u0027ve been forced to change the way some of your teams operate, and you\u0027ve been forced to create some smart data architecture on top of your legacy IT. Then it\u0027s a bit self-propelled and you have much less resistance. The first few big victories are super costly.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nHow should companies identify those two or three major efforts where they should focus their investment?\nDuranton:\nYou need to pick a topic where you are convinced that the business people in charge of that 70 percent—the change effort—are up for it. I\u0027ve seen many discussions at companies where someone says, \"Okay, why not apply something tech-focused to this process?\" Then you have the business owners say, \"Yeah, why not?\" You can\u0027t start like that. You need to start with the commitment that the technology will be used. \nIf you don\u0027t have that commitment, and if you don\u0027t provide resources for that team to work on that initiative right now, it\u0027s just lab work: “We can show you a shiny object, but there’s nothing in the end.” So that commitment is what is hard to get. Leadership teams need to focus on the place where leaders will have the right mindset and the appetite to really disrupt the organization and work in this new way.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nSuch massive organizational efforts will surely require changes in talent, either through new hiring or upskilling. How should companies approach that aspect?\nDuranton:\nTwo important things here: There are the skills of people that will be users of technology, and there are the skills of people who will be builders of technology. \nFor users of the technology, there is massive upskilling that is required. It’s not just telling them about what AI can do, it’s saying, “Okay, concretely, this new solution in your hand—what’s the impact?” Then you’ve got the builders, which is where I don\u0027t think companies will be able to internalize everything required. There\u0027s a war for talent out there. Even if you open your checkbook and you write big checks to recruit people, the challenge is to make sure that those talents continue to learn and provide.\nFew companies can really build an end-to-end team of people who can work on everything from blockchain to AI. You need a full ecosystem there. You need a huge network. In most situations, it should be a combination of internal and external resources.WIRED Brand Lab:\nThe kind of effort you’re describing for true transformational change is enormous. Do you think companies will be scared off of that as we head into what feels like a very uncertain 2023 market?\nDuranton:\nWe\u0027ve done a survey on this. 60 percent of the companies that we surveyed say that they want to increase their investments into digital technology, AI, and digital transformation; 36 percent say they just want to continue as-is. Only 4 percent say they should be decreasing investment. \n\nI think companies understand that the need to innovate is bigger than ever in the current market situation, either to steer operations in a very uncertain world or to innovate for your clients. We need technology to move through crises. We saw that a lot with the Covid crisis, where companies who were more advanced in terms of technology could better manage the situation, and companies who were lacking suffered a lot from the competitive standpoint. Everyone is sort of sensing that pressure will increase in 2023, and those who master technology will take advantage of that.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nHow much is consumer expectation driving that general market pressure?\nDuranton:\nIt is a massive market force, and it will accelerate because there\u0027s a generational thing here. The new generation, they have no patience for many of the things that some of the more traditional companies are doing and the way they operate. That\u0027s why, for many companies, it\u0027s a question of survival: If you don\u0027t adapt to the future or current world, as defined by digital standards, you will be out of business pretty soon.\nThat push has been really coming from the digital world, from people who think it\u0027s no longer acceptable to be dealt with so badly in so many instances of our life as citizens or as consumers.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nBut how many of the technologies that consumers are hearing about in the media every day are really ready for mass deployment, and how many are still just hype?\nDuranton:\nAI, I think, is there. We can discuss how it is still changing, but AI is there. Quantum computing is not there and won\u0027t be there for some time. We\u0027ve had the hype period on the metaverse, but now we have a bit of a backlash mode on the metaverse. There are doubts in the minds of many consumers of that really bringing something to the world. My sense is we need a bit of patience on that one. \nAs long as the customer experience is not there, something will not take off. For example, in 1993, I was working in the research lab for electric vehicles. Everyone was excited. It was cool. But the demand wasn\u0027t there. After the hype, things cooled down. Then Tesla came in. Everyone sees a Tesla, they feel it\u0027s cool, and they want it. Now it\u0027s picking up. In the end, customer experience is the name of the game. And with the metaverse, it is not there. The three things where companies have highest expectations in the short term are advanced AI, blockchain, and the internet of things (IoT), because they need this architecture to be able to have much more pervasive device support and real-time decision support in a decentralized way.WIRED Brand Lab:\nWhat are the three things you’re most excited about?\nDuranton:\nIt\u0027s a combination of advanced AI, blockchain, and synthetic biology (synbio). I think synbio has intangible potential, but I think combining the three can solve the biggest challenges for companies and for the world.\nI\u0027m sure that in 10 years, from a tech standpoint, we\u0027ll be in a completely new world. What has happened over the last 20 years or 30 years will now happen much faster. When you talk to companies, governments, citizens, and consumers, there\u0027s a massive appetite for more innovation. And when you talk to people in the labs, they have massive innovations on the shelf.\nWe need to connect the dots here and start materializing the promise of technology. And I think that is what will happen in the next five to 10 years. I\u0027m positive that the world will be very different.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nIt feels like BCG has a key role to play in that advancement—especially with the launch of its new team, BCG X. Tell us a little about that group and its mission. \nDuranton:\nThe mission statement is to partner with companies to really make the promise of technology a reality, and to then help large corporations scale this disruptive technology. \"X\" is a symbol of multiplication, and we want to generate big outcomes—multiplying outcomes by two, three, or 10 times. It\u0027s a big ambition, because I think we need big ambition.\nPart of the idea of multiplication is also that joining forces helps. It\u0027s joining forces with our clients, who are our partners—we believe in the notion of multiplying talents to multiply your impact. Like I said at the beginning, digital transformation has stalled for most companies; we want to be the solution for that. \nCompanies are getting frustrated with their traditional tech vendors. It\u0027s slow, they don\u0027t see things progress enough, and they need more. That\u0027s a result of being too tech-centric when you do things.

But others argued that the site might just be down for technical reasons or to carry out routine maintenance. Few suspected the truth. “People have always screamed exit scam in the past, and they\u0027ve always been wrong,” wrote one user on Reddit. “I really hope this turns out the same.” Another added, “Until we know otherwise, keep the faith.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Almost immediately, faithful or not, AlphaBay\u0027s vendors and buyers went looking for a new market where they could continue business as usual. The natural choice was AlphaBay\u0027s biggest rival, Hansa, which was well run and already growing fast. “wow alphabay exit scam. crazyness!” one user wrote on Twitter. “moving to hansa.”\nThis story is excerpted from Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available now from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBack in the Netherlands, the Dutch police were waiting for them. For two weeks, they had been overseeing Hansa\u0027s vast marketplace, surveilling its users and collecting their messages, delivery addresses, and passwords. Their Driebergen conference room, where the small team of undercover investigators had continued to work in shifts around the clock, had taken on the atmosphere of a college dorm. Chips, cookies, chocolates, and energy drinks covered the table, a warm, stale funk pervading the air.\nAt one point the head of investigations for the Dutch National Police paid them a visit to see their landmark operation in action. He was visibly offended by the smell and left after 10 minutes. Someone brought in an air freshener. (“It didn\u0027t really work,” a team member says.)\nHansa\u0027s marketplace, meanwhile, was thriving. In the days before the AlphaBay takedown, it was adding nearly a thousand new registered users a day, all falling into the trap the Dutch had patiently set. When AlphaBay went offline, that number spiked to more than 4,000 a day. Then more than 5,000 the next day. Then, two days after that, 6,000.Soon, as the market absorbed AlphaBay\u0027s wayward users, the Dutch team was logging a thousand daily transactions. The paperwork of tracking and sending those order records to Europol—not to mention attempting to intercept every order shipped to the Netherlands—became so massive that the police were briefly overwhelmed. They reluctantly decided to shut down new registrations for a full week. “Due to the influx of Alphabay refugees we are dealing with technical issues,” read a message they posted to the site. Those refugees, however, remained so eager to join that some Hansa users began selling their accounts on web forums, like scalpers selling tickets to a concert.\nThen, in the middle of that week, on July 13, one prong of Operation Bayonet suddenly slipped into the light. The Wall Street Journal broke the news that AlphaBay had been taken down by a joint law enforcement operation involving the US, Thai, and Canadian governments and that the site\u0027s administrator, Alexandre Cazes, had been found dead in a Thai jail cell.\nThere was no mention in the article of Hansa or the Dutch police. And when the Dutch reached out to the FBI, they were surprised and relieved to find that the Americans were willing to keep mum—to follow the Dutch team\u0027s lead and delay any announcement of the entirety of Operation Bayonet. The still-operational, undercover half of their one-two punch would remain hidden for as long as the Dutch chose to pursue it.\nSo a week after pausing new registrations on Hansa, the Driebergen team turned them on again. New user sign-ups soon spiked to more than 7,000 a day.\nTHE DUTCH KNEW that their operation couldn\u0027t go on indefinitely. They could see the moment approaching when they would have to take off their masks, reveal their surveillance coup, and tear down the market they\u0027d so carefully rebuilt and maintained. They were, after all, facilitating drug sales, not all of which were being intercepted in the mail.\nThe closer they got to the end of the sting, meanwhile, the less they had to lose if they were discovered—and the more risks they were willing to take.\nThroughout the operation, the Dutch team would hold what they called “evil plan” meetings, brainstorming ever more devious schemes to track and identify the unwitting users of the market they controlled. They created a list of those tactics, ordering the menu of surveillance actions from least to most likely to blow their cover. As they reached their endgame, they began to put their most brazen ideas into practice.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay  companion newsletter. \nHansa had long ago implemented a standard feature for dark-web markets, designed to protect their vendors: When sellers uploaded images for their product listings, the site automatically stripped those images of their metadata—information nested within the file, such as what sort of camera had taken the photo and the GPS location of where the image was created. The Dutch had silently sabotaged that feature early on, recording images\u0027 metadata before it was stripped, so as to catalog uploaders\u0027 locations. But they had managed to pinpoint only a few vendors that way; they found that most rarely updated their listings or posted new photos.\nSo, a few weeks into their takeover, the police wiped every image from the site. They claimed that a server had failed due to a technical glitch, and they announced that vendors would have to re-upload all the images for their listings. Those fresh uploads allowed the Dutch cops to scrape the metadata from a vast new batch of images. They quickly obtained the locations of 50 more of the site\u0027s dealers.In another scheme in the last days of their operation, the Driebergen team came up with an idea for how to get the IP addresses of the site\u0027s sellers, despite their use of the anonymity software Tor. It involved a sort of Trojan horse. Hansa\u0027s administrators announced that they were offering an Excel file to vendors that included codes that would allow them to retrieve their bitcoins stored in escrow on the market, even if the site was taken down. When only a small number of Hansa\u0027s dealers took them up on the offer, the police tried adding more helpful information to it, designed to lure vendors, like buyer statistics that would let the sellers track and rank their best customers. When even that feature got lackluster adoption, the Dutch cops pushed their ruse to its extreme: They warned the site\u0027s users that they had detected suspicious activity on their servers and said all vendors should download the backup cryptocurrency retrieval file immediately or risk losing their funds.\nAll the while, of course, the files the team was pushing on vendors were functioning as secret digital beacons. The top left of the Excel spreadsheet displayed an image of the Hansa logo, a stylized Viking ship. The police had designed the Excel file to fetch that image from their own server when the spreadsheet was opened. As a result, they could see the IP address of every computer requesting it. Sixty-four sellers on the market took the bait.\nIn the most involved scheme of all, the Dutch team turned their sights to the staff of the marketplace itself, the moderators who were directly working for them. They\u0027d found that one moderator in particular was extremely dedicated—very “emotionally involved” in the site, as the team lead, Petra Haandrikman, put it. The Dutch team felt a collective sense of admiration and affection for this hard worker—while simultaneously hatching a scheme to try to arrest him.\nThey offered him a promotion. Hansa\u0027s two bosses would give him a raise, but only if he agreed to become a third admin of the site. The moderator was overjoyed, immediately accepting. Then they explained that for him to become an admin, they\u0027d have to either arrange a meeting in person or get his mailing address so that they could send him a two-factor authentication token—a physical USB stick plugged into a PC to prove his identity and keep his account secure.\nIn his next message, the moderator\u0027s tone suddenly changed. He explained that he had made a promise to himself that if his bosses at Hansa ever asked for his identifying information or tried to meet him in person, he would immediately quit and wipe all of the devices he had used in his moderator job. Now he planned to abide by that promise. He said goodbye.\nThat moderator\u0027s sudden decision—a very wise one, likely saving him from a prison sentence—meant that the admins now had an opening to fill. So they began advertising that they were taking applications for a new moderator. At the end of a series of questions about qualifications and experience, they would ask “successful” applicants for their address so that they could mail them a two-factor authentication token. Some, eager for the job, handed over the locations of their homes. “Please don\u0027t send the cops to this address hahahahahaha just kidding,” one would-be moderator wrote, as he, in fact, sent his address to the cops. “I trust you guys because Hansa support was always good and helpful.”Savvier dark-web users, of course, never gave out their home addresses. In cases where they needed to receive a package, they sent shippers the address of a “drop”—a location away from their homes where they could, if necessary, deny the package was theirs.\nTo circumvent that safeguard, the Dutch police went one step further: For moderator applicants who provided a drop address, they shipped them the two-factor token hidden inside the packaging of a teddy bear, a cute stuffed panda with a soft pink nose. They intended the panda to appear as an innocuous disguise to hide the authentication token, a sign of their new employers\u0027 attention to opsec—and, perhaps, their sense of humor.\nThe Dutch cops hoped their targets would take the stuffed pandas home as a kind of gift or souvenir. Unbeknownst to the recipients, each one also contained, hidden deep in its stuffing, a small GPS tracker.\nCHAPTER 15\nPANIC\nON JULY 20, after running Hansa for 27 days, the Dutch prosecutors decided it was finally time to give up their game—over the objections of several members of the Driebergen team controlling the site, who had more ideas for surveillance tricks still up their sleeves.\nIn a press conference at the Dutch police\u0027s national headquarters in The Hague, the head of the agency dramatically pressed a large red plastic button to shut down the site. (In fact, the button was just a prop; an agent sitting nearby with a laptop sent the simultaneous command to the server that finally pulled Hansa offline.) Simultaneously, the US Justice Department announced the news in a DC press conference in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke about the coordinated action against both AlphaBay and Hansa. Sessions used the opportunity to issue a warning to the dark web\u0027s users. “You are not safe. You cannot hide,” he told them, from a packed room of reporters and cameras. “We will find you, dismantle your organization and network. And we will prosecute you.”Nearly 16 days after it had inexplicably disappeared, the AlphaBay site rematerialized with a notice covered in law enforcement agency logos and words that would be familiar to any Silk Road user: “THIS HIDDEN SITE HAS BEEN SEIZED.”\nThe Dutch, meanwhile, put up a slightly different message on Hansa: “THIS HIDDEN SITE HAS BEEN SEIZED and controlled since June 20.” The Dutch seizure notice linked to another dark-web site that the police had created themselves, which listed dark-web vendors by pseudonym under three categories: those under investigation, those who had been identified, and those who had been arrested—a list that they suggested was about to grow significantly. “We trace people who are active at Dark Markets and offer illicit goods or services,” the site read. “Are you one of them? Then you have our attention.”\nThe Dutch team in Driebergen, even after exposing their operation, still had one last card to play: They decided to try the usernames and passwords they had already collected from Hansa on the largest surviving dark-web drug bazaar, known as Dream Market. They found that at least 12 of that site\u0027s dealers had reused their Hansa credentials there. They were able to immediately take over those accounts and lock out the vendors—who promptly posted panicked messages to public forums suggesting that Dream had been compromised as well.\nAll of that carefully coordinated agitprop and disruption was expressly designed to sow fear and uncertainty across the dark-web community—to “damage the trust in this whole system,” as the Dutch police\u0027s Marinus Boekelo said.\nIt had its immediate intended effect. “Looks like I\u0027ll be sober for a while. Not trusting any markets,” wrote one user on Reddit.\n“DO NOT MAKE NEW ORDERS ON ANY DNM ANY MORE!” wrote another, using the common abbreviation for “dark net market.”\n“So it\u0027s a wrap for the darknet?” one user asked.\n“To everyone who thinks they\u0027re screwed and wants to flee the country,” another advised, “do so ASAP.”\nTHAT ALL-PERVADING PARANOIA was, for many of the dark web\u0027s users, warranted. In their nearly four weeks of running Hansa, the Dutch had surveilled 27,000 transactions. After shutting down the site, they seized 1,200 bitcoins from Hansa, worth tens of millions of dollars as of this writing, thanks in part to silently sabotaging the site\u0027s implementation of a Bitcoin feature called multi-signature transactions, designed to make that sort of simple confiscation impossible. They had collected at least some amount of data on a staggering total of 420,000 users, including more than 10,000 home addresses.\nIn the months following the takeover, Gert Ras, the head of the unit that oversaw the operation, said Dutch police carried out around 50 “knock and talks” in the Netherlands, visiting known buyers to warn them they had been identified and should stop purchasing narcotics online, though he said they arrested only one high-volume customer.\nThe site\u0027s sellers weren\u0027t so lucky: Within a year, more than a dozen of Hansa\u0027s top dealers had been arrested. Finally, the Dutch police fed the massive corpus of dark-web data they\u0027d collected into a database controlled by Europol, which in turn shared it with law enforcement agencies around the world.The direct ripple effects of that explosion of incriminating data, passed through so many institutions\u0027 records, aren\u0027t easy to track. But over the following years, Grant Rabenn, who served as custodian of the files the Justice Department had assembled from Operation Bayonet, says he received requests for that information as part of dozens of cases that agencies across the United States were still pursuing.\nA series of massive, high-profile dark-web busts would follow. These operations were all carried out by a new group known as JCODE, or Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement, pulling together agents from the FBI, DEA, Department of Homeland Security, US Postal Inspection Service, and half a dozen other federal agencies: in 2018, Operation Disarray; in 2019, Operation SaboTor; in 2020, Operation DisrupTor. In total, according to the FBI, those enforcement campaigns would eventually result in more than 240 arrests, 160 “knock and talks,” and the seizure of more than 1,700 pounds of drugs, along with $13.5 million in cash and cryptocurrency.\nBut the Hansa side of the operation was not without costs. Aside from the vast manpower and resources Operation Bayonet had required, it had demanded that a group of Dutch police become dark-web kingpins. For nearly a month, they had facilitated the sale of untold quantities of deadly narcotics to unknown buyers across the world. Even as they compromised Hansa, Hansa had compromised them too.\nDid the Dutch police feel that sense of taint—taint that perhaps comes with any undercover work? Some, at least, describe feeling surprisingly unconflicted about their role. “To be honest, it was exciting, mostly,” said the team lead, Petra Haandrikman. Dutch prosecutors had, after all, already reviewed the case, weighed its ethics, and given them the green light. After that, the police involved felt they could push the operation as far as possible with a clean conscience.\nThe Dutch police pointed out that they did ban the especially deadly opiate fentanyl from Hansa while it was under their control, in an effort to minimize the harm they might be responsible for—a move Hansa\u0027s users actually applauded. In truth, however, that ban had come just a few days before the end of their undercover operation. Until then, for more than three weeks, that highly dangerous opioid had continued to be offered on the site, with no guarantee that all of its orders would be intercepted.\nAnd how did the police feel about the decision to oversee those narcotics sales rather than shut Hansa down and prevent the transactions altogether?\n“They would have taken place anyway,” Gert Ras said without hesitation, “but on a different market.”\n“I welcome you to the re-opening of our professionally-run, anonymous, secure marketplace AlphaBay,” DeSnake’s message began.\nIN THE YEARS since, the dark web\u0027s observers have tried to determine to what extent Operation Bayonet actually disrupted that endless interchangeability of markets, the constant cycle of raid, rebuild, and repeat. Could the highly coordinated global takedown of AlphaBay—or anything else—end or even slow the eternal shell game law enforcement agencies had by then been playing for years, with a new market constantly ready to absorb the users of the last?\nOne study, at least, suggested that the AlphaBay and Hansa busts had more lasting effects than previous dark-web takedowns. The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, which goes by the acronym TNO, found that when other markets had been seized, like the Silk Road or Silk Road 2, most of their drug vendors soon showed up on other dark-web drug sites. But the vendors who fled Hansa after Bayonet\u0027s one-two punch didn\u0027t reappear, or if they did, they had been forced to scrub their identities and reputations, re-creating themselves from scratch. “Compared to both the Silk Road takedowns, or even the AlphaBay takedown, the Hansa Market shutdown stands out in a positive way,” the TNO report read. “We see the first signs of game-changing police intervention.”Carnegie Mellon\u0027s Nicolas Christin, a quantitative researcher of dark-web drug markets with an especially long track record, isn\u0027t so sure. Based on data he and his fellow researchers assembled by analyzing feedback posted to markets, they conservatively estimated that AlphaBay was generating between $600,000 and $800,000 a day in sales before it was shut down, well over double Silk Road\u0027s peak revenue. But his team found that the next inheritor of the dark web\u0027s refugees, Dream Market, eventually grew to become almost as big as AlphaBay, or perhaps even bigger—before its administrators disappeared and the market quietly dropped offline in 2019.\nChainalysis\u0027 blockchain-based measurements, by contrast, found that AlphaBay was generating as much as $2 million a day in average sales just before its shutdown—revenue that no other dark-web market of its kind has ever rivaled. (The Russian-language dark-web site Hydra, which was pulled offline by German law enforcement in April 2022, did top those numbers, taking in more than $1.7 billion in bitcoin in 2021, according to Chainalysis. But because its black-market contraband sales were difficult to distinguish from its money-laundering services, its inflows of cryptocurrency aren\u0027t directly comparable to AlphaBay\u0027s.) The FBI has estimated that Cazes\u0027 site, with more than 369,000 product listings and 400,000 users at its peak, was 10 times the size of Silk Road when it was pulled offline.\nRegardless of who holds the title for the largest dark-web market of all time, Christin predicts that this anonymous contraband economy cycle will continue long after the dark web\u0027s memory of Operation Bayonet has faded, as long as there are buyers for illegal, lucrative, and often highly addictive products.\n“History has taught us that this ecosystem is very, very resilient,” he says. “What happened in 2017 was very unique, that one-two punch. But that doesn\u0027t seem to have dented the ecosystem in a major way.”\nEven on the day that the Hansa takedown was announced and Operation Bayonet was finally revealed, some users seemed ready to return to the dark web as soon as the chaos subsided, and their insatiable need for another fix began to make itself felt. The very same Reddit user who had posted to the site\u0027s dark-net market forum that they would be “sober for a while” ended their message with a note of stubborn persistence.\n“Things will stabilize, they always do,” that anonymous user wrote. “The Great Game of whack-a-mole never ends.”\nCHAPTER 16\nRESURRECTION\nIN EARLY AUGUST 2021, just as I was reporting out the final details of AlphaBay\u0027s downfall, something unexpected happened: It rose from the dead.\n“AlphaBay is back,” read a message posted to Ghostbin, a site for publishing anonymous text-based messages. “You read that right, AlphaBay is back.”The message appeared to be authored by DeSnake, AlphaBay\u0027s former number two administrator and security specialist. To prove his identity, DeSnake had cryptographically signed the message with his PGP key—a method to show that the writer of the message possessed the long, secret series of characters that only DeSnake had access to, like a king stamping a letter with a personal signet ring. Multiple security researchers privately confirmed that the signature matched the one from DeSnake\u0027s messages as an AlphaBay administrator years earlier. The author seemed to be AlphaBay\u0027s long-lost lieutenant—or, at the very least, someone who\u0027d gotten ahold of his key.\n“I welcome you to the re-opening of our professionally-run, anonymous, secure marketplace AlphaBay to buy or sell products and services,” DeSnake\u0027s message began. The staff of this new AlphaBay, he wrote, had “20 years of experience in computer security alone, underground businesses, darknet market management, customer support and most importantly evading Law Enforcement.”\nSure enough, when I entered the site\u0027s address into a Tor browser, a reincarnated AlphaBay appeared—albeit a newly launched one. It was the same market as the one last seen in 2017, but restarted from scratch, with none of AlphaBay\u0027s many thousands of vendors. And there was another major difference: Now that he had taken over from Alpha02, DeSnake allowed transactions only in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero, not Bitcoin, to prevent the blockchain analysis that had played such a central role in AlphaBay\u0027s takedown.\nI reached out to DeSnake for an interview, writing to his account on the Tor-protected web forum Dread. Within 24 hours, I found myself exchanging encrypted instant messages with the newly resurfaced, would-be kingpin of the dark web.\nDeSnake quickly explained why he had reappeared only now—fully four years after the original AlphaBay had been torn offline, after Cazes had died in jail and the rest of AlphaBay\u0027s staff had scattered. He had intended, he wrote, to retire after AlphaBay was seized, but his plans changed after he saw the news that an FBI agent involved in the AlphaBay takedown had shown a video of Cazes\u0027 arrest at the 2018 Fordham International Conference on Cyber Security and had spoken about Cazes in a way that DeSnake deemed disrespectful.\n“The biggest reason I am returning is to make the AlphaBay name be remembered as more than the marketplace which got busted and the founder made out to have committed suicide,” DeSnake wrote, in his slightly foreign-inflected English. “AlphaBay name was put in bad light after the raids. I am here to make amends to that.”\nDeSnake repeated the claim I\u0027d heard before: that Cazes was murdered in jail. He offered no real evidence but said that he and Alpha02 had developed a contingency plan in case of his arrest—a kind of automated mechanism that would reveal Alpha02\u0027s identity to DeSnake if he disappeared for a certain amount of time, so that AlphaBay\u0027s number two could help him in jail. (Whether that help would have come in the form of a legal defense fund or the “helicopter gunship” Cazes had mentioned to Jen Sanchez, DeSnake refused to say.)Cazes would never have killed himself before their plan could even go into effect, DeSnake argued. “He was a fighter,” he wrote. “Me and him had backup plan, I guarantee you that a good and working one, backed by funds etc. However he got killed.”\nDeSnake described countermeasures he\u0027d since developed for practically every tactic that had been used to capture Cazes and take down the original AlphaBay. DeSnake never stepped away from his computer when it was unlocked, he wrote, not even to use the bathroom. He claimed to use an “amnesiac” operating system to avoid storing incriminating data, as well as “kill switches” to destroy any remaining information that law enforcement might find on his machines, should they leave his control. He even wrote that he\u0027d designed a system called AlphaGuard that will automatically set up new servers if it detects that the ones that run the site are being seized.\nBut the biggest factor protecting DeSnake was almost certainly geographic: He wrote that he\u0027s based in a former USSR country, beyond Western governments\u0027 reach. While he acknowledged that Cazes had used fake clues to suggest a Russian nationality to throw off investigators, he claimed that AlphaBay\u0027s ban on victimizing people from that part of the world was genuine and designed to protect him and other actual post-Soviet citizen AlphaBay staffers from local law enforcement.\n“We did that for security of other staff members,” DeSnake wrote. Cazes then “decided to embrace it as a way to secure himself.”\nEven so, DeSnake claimed that he had traveled multiple times through countries with US extradition treaties and had never been caught. He credited that track record in part to his careful money laundering, though aside from his preference for Monero, he declined to detail his methods.\n“Anyone who believed any currency method or cryptocurrency is safe is a fool or at the very least very ignorant. Everything is tracked,” he wrote. “You have to go through certain methods to be able to enjoy the fruits of your work … it costs to do what you do. If you are a legit business you pay taxes. If you are doing this you pay taxes in forms of obfuscating your money.”\nDeSnake said he was shocked when he learned of Alpha02\u0027s early slipup that first revealed his email address to the DEA. “I am still in disbelief to this day that he had put his personal email on there,” DeSnake wrote. “He was a good carder and he knew better opsec.”\nBut he added that Cazes\u0027 failure to hide his money trails to the degree DeSnake recommended was a more willful mistake. DeSnake had warned the previous AlphaBay boss about the need to take more measures against financial surveillance, he said. Alpha02 hadn\u0027t listened.\n“Some advice he took, other he disgarded as ‘overkill,’” DeSnake wrote. “In this game there is no overkill.”\nONE AFTERNOON, AT the end of several weeks of on-and-off chats with DeSnake about how he planned to win this next round of the dark web\u0027s cat-and-mouse game, he shared some news: The mice had scored another small victory.DeSnake sent me a series of links to Tor-protected websites that he described as “DarkLeaks.” Someone, it seems, had hacked the Italian police agency responsible for investigating a pair of dark-web drug sites, known as Deep Sea and Berlusconi Market. Now that hacker had published a broad collection of stolen documents that offered an inside view into law enforcement\u0027s secret work to take down those sites.\nWithin the DarkLeaks collection, one slide deck immediately caught my eye. It was a presentation from Chainalysis. It described, in Italian, a remarkable set of surveillance tricks that Chainalysis offered law enforcement but that had never before been publicly revealed, including the ability to trace Monero in a majority of cases. The slides even seemed to reveal that Chainalysis had turned a free blockchain analysis tool it had acquired, WalletExplorer, into a honeypot: The company had turned over identifying information to law enforcement about people who used the tool to check the traceability of their coins.\nBut amid these revelations, there was another slide that finally offered the most elusive answer I\u0027d been looking for: a possible solution to the mystery of the “advanced analysis” trick Chainalysis had used to locate the AlphaBay server in Lithuania.\nThe Italian presentation confirmed that Chainalysis can, in fact, identify the IP addresses of some wallets on the blockchain. It did so by running its own Bitcoin nodes, which quietly monitored transaction messages. This appeared to be the very practice that had led to a scandal in the company\u0027s earliest days, when it was revealed that Chainalysis was running its own Bitcoin nodes to collect the IP addresses of cryptocurrency users—an experiment it had promised was shut down after an outcry about it spread across the Bitcoin community.\nOne slide in particular described a tool called Rumker, explaining that Chainalysis could use its surreptitious Bitcoin nodes to identify the IP addresses of anonymous services, including dark-web markets. “Although many illegal services run on the Tor network, suspects are often negligent and run their bitcoin node on clearnet,” the slide read, using a term for the traditional internet not protected by Tor.\nHad AlphaBay made this mistake? Rumker sounded very much like the secret weapon that had pinpointed that dark-web giant\u0027s IP address, and likely those of many other targets too.\n(When I wrote to Chainalysis\u0027 Michael Gronager to ask about the slides and specifically about Rumker, he didn\u0027t deny the presentation\u0027s legitimacy. Instead, he sent me a statement that read like a kind of summation of his stance on Bitcoin\u0027s privacy, which he argues is virtually nonexistent: “Open protocols are openly monitored—to keep the space safe—and to enable a permission-less value transfer network to flourish.”)\nRumker, if it was in fact the tool that located AlphaBay, had likely just been “burned.” Whoever leaked it had, in doing so, exposed the vulnerabilities of the Bitcoin protocol it exploits. Dark-web administrators like DeSnake will no doubt take more care in the future to prevent their cryptocurrency wallets from revealing their IP addresses to snooping Bitcoin nodes.\nBut there will be other vulnerabilities, and other secret weapons to exploit them. The cat-and-mouse game continues. And for every Alpha that\u0027s taken down, another will be waiting in the dark web\u0027s manifold shadows, ready to rise into their place.\nThis story is excerpted from Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available now from Doubleday. \nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

You went to Blackwater Pond?\nLauren Goode: I was. I was actually there. But no, I guess if I\u0027m being truthful, as a journalist and as a professional keeper of the historical record, I probably should download my archive. Have you done it yet?\nMichael Calore: Not in years, no.\nLauren Goode: Have you deleted all of your super secret DMs on Twitter?\nMichael Calore: I\u0027ve deleted some of them, but I\u0027m not sure that I actually deleted them.\nLauren Goode: OK. We need to talk about this.\n[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]\nMichael Calore: Let\u0027s do it. Hi, everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I am Michael Calore. I\u0027m a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I\u0027m Lauren Goode. I\u0027m a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We are also joined by WIRED security writer Lily Hay Newman. Hi, Lily. Welcome back.\nLily Hay Newman: Hello. Thanks for having me.\nMichael Calore: As always, it\u0027s a pleasure to have you here. So look, we know we\u0027ve been talking about Twitter a lot on the show recently, and sure, we are journalists and journalists are obsessed with Twitter. But for today\u0027s show, we want to talk about Twitter one more time but specifically because Twitter is currently suffering some security issues that have wide implications. Since the new boss over there, Elon Musk, laid off roughly 3,700 employees two weeks ago, many people have been keeping close watch over Twitter to see what kind of chaos might erupt. Security professionals and data privacy wonks are watching, and they\u0027re probably sighing a lot, but hackers and attackers and scammers are circling the platform as well. Lily, it is always fun to have you on the show, even if when you\u0027re here we always end up talking about these doom and havoc situations. But I guess the first question about the security situation at Twitter we have to ask you is this, what is going on inside the company that we know? With the recent layoffs and resignations, how stretched is Twitter\u0027s security staff?\nLily Hay Newman: Yes. This is an important question, and there isn\u0027t a ton that we know super specifically, but first of all, half of the workforce was laid off. We just know that broadly. We know that Elon Musk currently is actually encouraging even more people to leave if they\u0027re not willing to commit to a super intense, work-all-the-time approach. They have until today, I believe, Thursday, to consent to Mega Death Twitter or something. We\u0027ve also seen Musk conduct public firings via tweets, just in recent days. And two and a half weeks ago or so, at the beginning of this whole regime change, we saw Musk broadly fire many executives of the company or have them step down, including some who work on privacy and trust and identity issues within the company. So just all of that paints a picture of an internal situation where there just aren\u0027t probably going to be enough warm bodies to do everything that was happening a month ago. For security, that\u0027s always a big issue because security is all about monitoring, it\u0027s all about constant vigilance, always improving, always investing more. So this is just a climate that is not going to be conducive to strong cybersecurity defenses broadly.Lauren Goode: So we know there have been a lot of layoffs. We know that in the missive he sent out earlier this week where he said \"If you\u0027re not hardcore, don\u0027t bother working here\" he also said that engineering would be the primary focus, with design and product management taking a backseat. Within that engineering structure, we just don\u0027t know how many people are going to be focused specifically on security. Is that correct?\nLily Hay Newman: Right. Certainly, I don\u0027t, at least, have a sense in the new world order of anything about team structures or things like that—of how many resources and how many people are going to be dedicated to those things. Keep in mind that IT is also a highly intersecting department with security in any organization, and things can be structured differently at different places. But just running an organization\u0027s devices and servers correctly is a security issue inherently.\nMichael Calore: Speaking of that, we\u0027ve already seen some things break down from the outside, right? Earlier this week, there was an issue with the SMS two-factor authentication system on Twitter.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. I did a story about how users were reporting that they couldn\u0027t receive authentication codes for logging in or for things like downloading their Twitter archive. They couldn\u0027t receive those codes via SMS, and when we tested it internally at WIRED, not everyone was having the problem, but some of us were. In one case, someone received a code on a delay—they got the SMS text message many hours later, which was strange. The Twitter comms department is currently either nonexistent or much reduced, so there isn\u0027t a good way to get official comment right now about these types of things. So we don\u0027t even have a clear sense of how those texts get sent or used to be sent—or is it an integration with a third-party service, as is often the case, where another company will provide the SMS infrastructure? Or is it something Twitter does in-house? Who knows? I also took one for the team, meaning all of you listeners and WIRED readers out there, and tweeted at Musk directly to ask him—\nLauren Goode: I was going to ask if you had done this yet. OK.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. I am clearly still on the podcast to tell the tale. So I\u0027m doing all right, thanks for checking in, but I didn\u0027t get a reply because there\u0027s just so many pressing issues for him to tweet about right now.\nLauren Goode: Are you telling us that Elon has not yet fired you from WIRED? He does not yet have the ability to do that?\nLily Hay Newman: Someone did note that perhaps I would cause a real problem by causing him to acquire WIRED just so he could fire me. So hopefully, that does not happen.\nLauren Goode: In all the futures I\u0027ve envisioned for WIRED, I have to say being owned by Elon Musk was not one of them.Michael Calore: Oh, I\u0027ve had that dream.\nLauren Goode: Is it a nightmare or a dream?\nMichael Calore: Well, no comment.\nLauren Goode: If Musk sent out a missive to the WIRED folks right now and is like, \"Are you hardcore or are you not?\" What would you do?\nMichael Calore: I would take the severance.\nLauren Goode: OK. Fair enough.\nMichael Calore: I talked to my union rep.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Oh, there you go. Well played. Well played. OK. So we have seen a breakdown in SMS two-factor authentication. We\u0027ve also seen some big entities affected by this new verification scheme, which keeps changing because some people have been creating fake accounts but getting blue checks, which make them look valid or legit. And then they\u0027re tweeting things that are affecting, say, the share price of giant pharmaceutical companies. What\u0027s the worst-case scenario for a really, really major security meltdown though, rather than a verification meltdown? Are all of our DMs exposed? Is our personal and private info used to hack us across other websites? Is there a heightened conflict across nation states? What\u0027s really the worst-case scenario here?\nLily Hay Newman: There are a few things that I think we should talk about. Certainly, one of them is a massive data breach. The data that Twitter holds, they don\u0027t have social security numbers or government identification information. They don\u0027t have health records broadly. They don\u0027t have financial data broadly, though people who signed up for Twitter Blue, I guess, needed to provide a credit card to do that, so they have those numbers. But they still have a lot of information about all their users. So as you said, the contents of direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted and are therefore accessible and could be compromised in a data breach. They have phone numbers, email addresses, things like that. And then also, the social graph of who has communicated with whom over the years and who people associate with, that type of information can be really sensitive and is a privacy issue, especially for users who are activists, journalists, dissidents, and operate in countries under repressive regimes. There can be very real safety issues to having social media data out publicly. But then also, as always, identity theft, harassment, any personal details that cybercriminals can get about people can fuel digital crime and scams, so all the data that would be in a massive Twitter breach has implications in that sense. But then there\u0027s a lot of other types of things to think about if we really want to get into worst-case scenario, and we\u0027re not saying that this has happened or there\u0027s evidence that this is happening. But if we view Twitter as being very much in chaos or in crisis and that we\u0027re just thinking here about things that could emerge out of that, the Twitter app is a trusted app on users\u0027 phones if they\u0027ve downloaded it. A rogue entity that compromises Twitter\u0027s infrastructure could, at least for a brief period, potentially weaponize the Twitter app to do bad things. As you said, verification gets into these questions about account takeovers. That\u0027s already been a problem for Twitter in the past. So I think it\u0027s just conceptually the idea that there\u0027s both the data and there\u0027s the trusted infrastructure, and either could be compromised. What\u0027s interesting about doing this thought experiment is that this isn\u0027t just true of Twitter, this is true of any entity that has centralized a lot of our data and where we trust their software on our devices, things like that. This type of digital infrastructure can be weaponized. It\u0027s not uniquely a Twitter thing.Michael Calore: All right. Well, let\u0027s take a break and we\u0027ll come right back.\nLauren Goode: On that uplifting note.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right. Lily, as you\u0027ve mentioned, Twitter is in this vulnerable position right now. So as users of Twitter, how worried should we be about our accounts getting taken over or getting locked out or our DMs being exposed?\nLily Hay Newman: Well, I really don\u0027t want to flip anyone out because there\u0027s no special knowledge here, we\u0027re all just hanging out, chatting. I don\u0027t know that there is a totally looming, tomorrow-type threat, but I think the big concern and the reason we\u0027re doing this thought experiment is, again, the chaos and confusion of this moment within the company definitely has the potential to create even more vulnerability and expose things even more.\nLauren Goode: So I\u0027m really curious about DMs, in particular. When you go to delete a DM on Twitter, you get a pretty clear message that says it\u0027s been deleted for you but it hasn\u0027t been deleted for the person or people on the other end of that message thread. Twitter also notoriously doesn\u0027t have end-to-end encrypted messaging. It seems like it\u0027s pretty insecure as far as those things go. Lily, how exactly does that work? Is there any way to actually delete your Twitter DMs?\nLily Hay Newman: So it\u0027s a very good question. I do not know the answer, and I don\u0027t think the answer is really known, partly because of the comms department breakdown in this current moment, but partly, it\u0027s been unclear for a long time. I think people have been asking this for a long time. I also have been trying to ask Twitter about this for a while. Your best shot is to get yourself and the other party or parties that were in the chat to all delete the messages in question so it\u0027s deleted on all the ends, as we call it. Whether or not that actually results in Twitter on its own servers permanently deleting the data after a period of time we just don\u0027t know, and I don\u0027t think anyone has been able to find out.\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm.\nMichael Calore: Right.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s incredibly reassuring. Yeah. I think 70 percent of my DMs are probably, \"Hi! It was really nice to meet you at fill-in-the-blank conference. Let\u0027s stay in touch,\" and then that was seven years ago.\nMichael Calore: And they never wrote back.\nLauren Goode: Or they did and then we were like, \"Yeah. Let\u0027s stay in touch,\" and then maybe, I don\u0027t know, you see them in another conference three years later. I don\u0027t think I have a lot of stuff in DMs, but Elon Musk owns our DMs now, folks.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It is sobering to think about. I know that when you delete your account, when you say, \"I would like to not have a Twitter account anymore\" and you delete everything, if you don\u0027t log in for 30 days, the company says that it\u0027s going to erase all of your information, which includes your DMs, all your tweets, all your profile information, all your location information, and your social graph, like who your friends were on Twitter. But that\u0027s what they say, we don\u0027t really know what their actual data retention practices are. We just know what their data retention policies are.Lauren Goode: Oh, that\u0027s interesting.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. That\u0027s a really important thing to point out because Twitter\u0027s policy on account deactivation says, \"If you do not log back into your account for the 30 days following the deactivation, your account will be permanently deactivated. Once permanently deactivated, all information associated with your account is no longer available in our production tools.\"\nLauren Goode: What does that mean?\nLily Hay Newman: So the word delete never once is there.\nMichael Calore: Right.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s no longer available—\nMichael Calore: In our production tools.\nLauren Goode: Wow. I\u0027m going to say that next time I delete somebody\u0027s number, \"They are no longer available in my contact tools.\"\nLily Hay Newman: In my production tool. Someone also pointed out to me that 30 days is actually not enough time to comply with all the data retention requirements that companies like Twitter would be under. They\u0027re not required to keep data forever, but Twitter may have data retention obligations that go beyond 30 days, which would also make that whole thing confusing or indicate that deactivation is not the same as deletion.\nLauren Goode: Separate but related to my question about deleting DMs. In the past, both Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk have talked about creating some kind of end-to-end encryption messaging system for Twitter, what\u0027s the status of that?\nLily Hay Newman: Yes. I don\u0027t know the current status of that.\nLauren Goode: Once again, Elon has not responded to your tweet.\nLily Hay Newman: Right. Though to be fair, I did not specifically tweet at him about that in the recent past. But yeah, I mean, people have said for a while that it might be coming. I support it any time. It\u0027s great. I think as many apps and services as possible as can roll out end-to-end encryption should. It feels to me like right now would not be the moment when Twitter could actually deploy that even if there\u0027s already been a bunch of work on it. But like I said, would love to be wrong and for them to release it at any time, it is possible. It\u0027s just like Twitter, in this moment of crisis, probably wouldn\u0027t be trusted as much.\nMichael Calore: So for the people with their finger on the pulse of what\u0027s going on at Twitter, a lot of them are just adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Some people are leaving, they\u0027re going to Mastodon. Most Twitter users are just continuing to use Twitter as normal, which is to be expected and is fine. It\u0027s what happens whenever there\u0027s big upheaval. Political intrigue inside of a company doesn\u0027t necessarily trickle down to everybody who is a customer of that company. But what are you doing, Lily? Are you panicking? Are you leaving? Are you hanging out to watch what happens?\nLily Hay Newman: When you said finger on the pulse, I thought you were going to say finger on the trigger. OK. Yes, I have not left Twitter. So my first thought is that I haven\u0027t changed a ton about how I\u0027m using Twitter yet. Definitely, don\u0027t leak things that are damaging to Elon Musk to journalists on Twitter DM. Do leak things that are going to be illustrative of what\u0027s going on inside the company to journalists on more secure platforms, such as Signal, but don\u0027t create new problems for yourself. What\u0027s done is done. What you were DMing about that\u0027s embarrassing in 2013 or whatever, it is what it is, but I would be extra vigilant now about not generating new privacy issues for yourself in Twitter DMs or private tweets and things like that. Personally, I would not have signed up for Twitter Blue in recent weeks, or in the past week, whenever that briefly happened. First of all, because I personally didn\u0027t want to or see benefits doing it, but second, because I wouldn\u0027t have wanted to provide more data to Twitter in order to do it, so that\u0027s one thing. Something I haven\u0027t personally done but that you could do if you want to be more paranoid or more aggressive about insulating yourself from risk of potential fallout would be to delete the app from your phone and only use Twitter in a web browser, which would potentially mitigate or would mitigate that potential rogue app situation. But as I said, I haven\u0027t done that yet. I\u0027m not necessarily saying you should, just trying to give people some ideas about the parameters of how to think about these things.Michael Calore: That\u0027s great advice. Thanks.\nLauren Goode: Your productivity will shoot through the roof too, not having Twitter on your phone.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. Benefits all around.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nLily Hay Newman: I don\u0027t know. What are you both thinking? Has it been bugging you?\nLauren Goode: I mean, I\u0027ve been on Twitter since 2009, I think? Maybe 2008. And so I do have a long history on Twitter, but I don\u0027t really feel like going through all of my old DMs and figuring out what\u0027s what. It seems like there should be an opportunity to batch-delete your DMs but maintain other elements of your Twitter account or go through and delete all the media you\u0027ve ever attached to tweets in case there\u0027s metadata baked into the media but not delete other things, but you can\u0027t. It\u0027s like you have to either just delete Twitter or live with it.\nMichael Calore: You should submit that request to the features team and see how long it takes for them to implement it.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s great. Do you have their email?\nLily Hay Newman: I was going to say, meanwhile, we don\u0027t even know if we can delete any data off of Twitter at all.\nLauren Goode: Right. So it just feels like a moot point. It feels like there\u0027s a lot of onus being put on the user right now for what is becoming an increasingly user-hostile experience.\nMichael Calore: Right.\nLauren Goode: What are your thoughts, Mike?\nMichael Calore: I\u0027m going to wait and see if the time comes when it feels like the right thing to do is to delete everything and bail, I will have no problems doing that.\nLauren Goode: When the time comes to let it go, let it go.\nMichael Calore: Let it go. Life is too short to worry about a Twitter account, that\u0027s what I always say.\nLauren Goode: It is.\nMichael Calore: Always. I say that all the time.\nLily Hay Newman: I\u0027ve heard you say it.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, Lily, thanks to this invigorating conversation about where this is all headed. Even if we don\u0027t have a lot of detail, it was great to get some good advice, so thanks.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. I\u0027m always happy to spread the joy.\nMichael Calore: Let\u0027s take a break, and when we come back, we\u0027ll do our recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right. Lily, you are our guest, so you get to go first. What is your recommendation for the people?\nLily Hay Newman: My recommendation this week is a type of protein bar. It\u0027s called Wicked protein bar and—\nLauren Goode: Is it from Massachusetts?\nLily Hay Newman: I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve only tried one flavor, and I\u0027m recommending that flavor, but I can\u0027t speak to any of the other flavors, so maybe this is of limited use. But the flavor I want to recommend is maple, and my reason for recommending this is that, I don\u0027t know if anyone else feels this way, it\u0027s very hard to find a protein bar that\u0027s low sugar, has a good amount of protein, doesn\u0027t taste gross but also that I actively like and can eat again and again. Do you all know what I\u0027m talking about?Michael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nLily Hay Newman: I usually ... I\u0027ll eat a protein bar, and I\u0027m like, \"Yeah. Oh, OK. Great. This is good,\" and then I go to eat it again, and I\u0027m like, \"No, I\u0027m sick of it. I don\u0027t want another one.\"\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Or you eat one and you just think like, \"OK, that was sustenance. Now, I can live for another hour.\"\nLily Hay Newman: Even the Wicked maple protein bars, that\u0027s pretty much all we\u0027re getting to. I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a favorite food, but I can eat them multiple times in whatever, a month or a week or whatever it is, and get through it and not be just like, I don\u0027t know, throwing it out or so fed up with myself for placing myself in the situation. But similar to the last time I was on the show, when I recommended a type of N95 mask and provided the disclosure that the masks are very unattractive, I do feel the need to provide a disclosure this time that other people who have tried the protein bars did not like them. So when I\u0027ve given them to friends or been like, \"Oh yeah, these protein bars are so good.\" They said they thought the flavor was gross and they don\u0027t understand … because it\u0027s not sweet, that\u0027s the thing. I don\u0027t like when protein bars are super sweet so—\nMichael Calore: Neither do I.\nLily Hay Newman: This is what you get when you have me on the show. My recommendations are a real mixed bag, but for my palate, Wicked Protein Bars in maple, 15 grams of protein, 2 grams of sugar, and I\u0027m seeing here, it says, \"Certified clean.\"\nMichael Calore: Well, that\u0027s something I always look for in foods that I\u0027m eating.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Certified clean? What? Like it\u0027s PG? I don\u0027t know.\nLily Hay Newman: Right, exactly. I need a G rating for my protein bars. Anyway, that\u0027s my recommendation.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s a pretty good one.\nMichael Calore: That sounds both delicious and nutritious. Thank you for the recommendation. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: I just have to say, while Lily was giving her excellent recommendation, I was going through my Twitter inbox and I went all the way back to my very first DM on Twitter. My very first DMs were in 2009, June 2009, and it was just a series of people saying, \"Hey, thanks for the follow,\" like there\u0027s a—\nMichael Calore: Old school.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s what people did then. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Old school.\nLauren Goode: There\u0027s someone with the handle @citizenfreepress and it\u0027s, \"Thanks for the follow.\" And then, @runnersworld, which I followed, \"Thanks for the follow.\" That\u0027s it. That\u0027s it, that\u0027s the excitement.\nMichael Calore: OK, Lauren. What is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation this week is Andy Greenberg\u0027s new book, Tracers in the Dark. Andy is a colleague of ours. He works closely with Lily on our security desk, and I have to admit, I have not yet read Andy\u0027s book. It just came out, and I\u0027m hoping that we will have the opportunity to have Andy on the show at some point to talk about it because he\u0027s doing the press circuit for it now. But his book, Tracers in the Dark, is about the investigators chasing criminals through the very dark crypto underworld. He interviews prosecutors, industry analysts, even some criminals themselves. He writes about how there are these clues in the pseudo-anonymous, decentralized blockchain that are tipping off investigators to these crimes, and it has a lot of bigger implications, I think, for our concepts of privacy and anonymity on the web. Andy is just a really powerful, masterful writer and excellent reporter. And so I look forward to reading it, but I recommend it for everyone else right now, Tracers in the Dark.Michael Calore: Nice.\nLily Hay Newman: Since you were scrolling during my recommendation, I was reading during your recommendation. No, I\u0027m just kidding, but I have read Tracers in the Dark so I just want to provide a testimonial, a reader testimonial, that it is really great and it is not ... If you are super into investing and the business of cryptocurrency or something, it\u0027s not about that. But for me, that was a big plus, like what I really wanted to learn about was the technology that underlies the blockchain and why there was this misconception that particularly Bitcoin transactions are untraceable. Why did people think that? Why did criminals think that? And why is it untrue? How can you trace these transactions? That has meant a lot of good things for law enforcement in terms of their ability to track cyber criminals, which Andy details in the book, but he also talks about the potential privacy implications of being able to trace transactions and historically back through time because the blockchain is this indelible record of everything that\u0027s ever happened. So yeah, just wanted to piggyback on just a quick reader recommendation.\nLauren Goode: Thanks, Lily. That\u0027s awesome.\nMichael Calore: I think curious readers can also check out an excerpt of Andy\u0027s book that is currently running on WIRED.com. I think it\u0027s a four-part excerpt?\nLauren Goode: Oh, that\u0027s exciting.\nLily Hay Newman: It\u0027s so many parts, and it\u0027s so good and so exciting. So it\u0027ll be in the show notes, right?\nMichael Calore: Yes, it will.\nLauren Goode: Mike, what\u0027s your recommendation this week?\nMichael Calore: My recommendation is a Netflix show called The Sandman, and it is an adaptation of a comic book from the late \u002780s/early \u002790s written by Neil Gaiman. A very famous comic book. It is a really well-done comic book adaptation, and if you know me at all, then you know that\u0027s not something I say that often, but it\u0027s a great show. I\u0027m really enjoying it. My wife is really enjoying it. It\u0027s a story of these folks who are immortals and they live in the sort of ether realm in and out of reality, and one of them gets trapped by this person who\u0027s an occultist who casts spells to try and trap immortals and is held hostage for 100 years and then escapes and has to reclaim all of the things that he lost, that were stolen from him, that were raided from him. And that sets him off on this series of adventures. I don\u0027t want to say anything more than that. I don\u0027t want to give it away. But it is fun, it\u0027s very emo, it\u0027s very dark, it\u0027s very adult, all the things that you want from a good comic book adaptation on Netflix. So that\u0027s my recommendation, The Sandman.\nLauren Goode: Who stars in it?\nMichael Calore: Nobody that you know. It\u0027s all British people. Although I will say, David Thewlis is in it. David Thewlis, the famous actor? Yeah, you\u0027re shaking your head no. You\u0027ll recognize him if you see him.Lauren Goode: OK.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. He\u0027s a dramatist, a really great actor, and he\u0027s quite good in this. He plays a villain.\nLauren Goode: So the protagonist is the Sandman?\nMichael Calore: Yeah. He\u0027s an anti-hero because he\u0027s somebody who\u0027s not really nice to people. He\u0027s kind of a jerk, but he has a crow, and his crow is funny. I think Patton Oswalt does the voice of the crow, so there are two famous people in it.\nLauren Goode: Nice.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Anyway, that\u0027s my rec. It\u0027s a good one.\nLauren Goode: Thank you for that.\nMichael Calore: Thank you, Lily, for joining us.\nLily Hay Newman: Thank you so much for having me. I just scrolled back in my Twitter DMs, and it looks like my first one ever is from The Baltimore Sun welcoming me to Twitter.\nMichael Calore: Wow.\nLauren Goode: Oh. Those were the days.\nMichael Calore: Wow, The Baltimore Sun. Did David Simon send it?\nLily Hay Newman: I hope so. Probably not, but I was living in Baltimore at the time, so I guess that\u0027s the tie-in. But yes, thank you for having me. And everyone, stay safe out there.\nMichael Calore: Thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter, still. Just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth. We\u0027ll be back next week. Goodbye.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","TWITTER","ELON MUSK","SECURITY"],"author":"BY WIRED STAFF","creation_date":"2022-11-17"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/alphabay-series-part-4-face-to-face/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The team uses a secret technique to locate AlphaBay’s server.

Jen Sanchez, a veteran Drug Enforcement Administration agent, had been assigned to bring the delegation on a flight from Bangkok to California to coordinate with the US team—to iron out any intercontinental wrinkles on the Bangkok end of what had come to be known as Operation Bayonet.\nThe Thai cops met the American agents, analysts, and prosecutors at the US attorney’s office, with more than two dozen people arrayed around the room. The two countries traded PowerPoint briefings. Ali and Erin, expert cryptocurrency-tracing FBI analysts from Washington, DC, walked the Thais through a “Bitcoin 101” presentation and detailed how they had tracked Cazes’ hidden cash flows. The Thais shared everything they’d learned from following Cazes’ physical movements for months. The police then explained the particulars of the Thai legal system—what US agents would and wouldn’t be allowed to do with Cazes after, if all went well, they laid hands on him.\nBetween meetings, Sanchez took the Thai group on field trips: to a golfing range, to a shopping mall—where the officers descended ravenously on a Coach outlet—and on an outing to San Francisco in rented vans. The Thais, accustomed to the tropics, nearly froze on Fisherman’s Wharf; they were so jet-lagged and exhausted from their sightseeing frenzy that they slept through the drive over the Golden Gate Bridge in both directions. On another day, the FBI gave the Thais a tour of the explosives lab at the bureau’s Sacramento field office, showing off the agency’s bomb-defusing robots. Paul Hemesath, the prosecutor, later brought out his HTC Vive VR headset, and the two countries’ agents took turns walking a plank over a digital abyss and swinging virtual swords at zombies.\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nWhen they weren’t busy with tourism and team-building exercises, the agents were grappling with the practical details of raiding a dark-web kingpin. At one point, the case’s lead FBI agent presented the looming problem of Cazes’ laptop encryption. Sanchez and the Thais explained that based on their surveillance, Cazes almost never opened his machine outside his own home. The agents agreed: They’d have to catch him in his house, logged in to AlphaBay and yet somehow off guard so that he wouldn’t shut the laptop before his arrest.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nA Timeline of Russian Cyberattacks on Ukraine\nAlmost as important as the computer was Cazes’ iPhone. The FBI told the Thais they’d need to grab it unlocked, or it too would be irretrievably encrypted. That phone, after all, might hold keys to Cazes’ cryptocurrency wallets or other crucial data. The question of how to thread the needle of capturing these two devices and their information hung in the air, unanswered.\nThen Sanchez spoke: She asked the lead FBI agent if it would be helpful to know more about how Cazes spent his days, hour by hour. After all, she explained, he had laid it all out on Roosh V, the online forum for “alpha males” where Cazes practically liveblogged his daily life and sexual escapades under the handle Rawmeo. The FBI agent invited her to go ahead.\nSo Sanchez walked the group through Cazes’ daily schedule as he had, himself, described it in exacting detail: Wake up at dawn and check his email and social media, including the Roosh V forum. Work out at home until the late morning. Have sex with his wife. Then go to his laptop and take care of business until the evening, with only a short break in the afternoon for a light lunch. At seven, he’d quit work for the day to go out for dinner and cruise for girls in his Lamborghini Aventador. Almost without fail he’d be back home and asleep by 11.Then Sanchez offered another observation from her Roosh V trawling: She could see on the forum exactly when Cazes was online. The little green light next to Rawmeo’s name wasn’t merely a reminder that they were seeing into Cazes’ thoughts in real time. It might also serve as an indicator of when his laptop was open—and when Alpha02 was vulnerable.\nJUST DAYS LATER, on the morning of June 20, 2017, in the small central Netherlands city of Driebergen, half a dozen Dutch police officers were huddled around a conference room where they’d been anxiously waiting since early that day. Finally, one of the investigators’ phones rang with a call from the German Federal Police. The Germans had just arrested the two administrators of Hansa, the dark web’s second-biggest black market for drugs, in their homes. Both men were in custody. The first phase of Operation Bayonet’s one-two punch—an unprecedented attempt to take down one market while secretly taking over another—could now begin.\nFor weeks, the Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit had been preparing for this moment. They’d used the source code for Hansa that they’d pulled from the German servers to reconstruct their own, offline, practice version of the market, to familiarize themselves with how it was built and administered. They’d even gone so far as to create their own play-money version of Bitcoin, with its very own blockchain—what cryptocurrency developers call a testnet—to privately experiment with how the site handled its monetary transactions.\nNow, with the real admins arrested, they had to take over and run the actual, live version of Hansa, with millions of dollars moving between tens of thousands of users. And they had to do it seamlessly, without knocking the site offline or, worse, giving its users or staff any clue that the two administrators had been replaced by a team of undercover Dutch police.\nAt the Germans’ signal, the Dutch team immediately called a pair of agents they’d sent to a data center in Lithuania, where the server actively running Hansa was hosted. Those agents physically pulled out a hard drive from the rack that held the machine so they could access a backup copy of its data. The teams in Driebergen and Lithuania then began feverishly duplicating every digital component of the market, piece by piece, on their own computers and then on a server in a Netherlands data center, reconstructing an exact copy of the site that was now under their control.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay companion newsletter. \nFor the next two days, the Dutch investigators sat at their keyboards from morning until well after midnight, fueled by pizza and Red Bull. At one point early on, someone spilled a soda onto the conference table, nearly soaking a laptop that stored the entire collection of the Hansa data; only a desperate lunge by one of the investigators managed to save it. At another point, a typo in a single command caused the site to go down for several panicky minutes before it could be restored.\nAround 3 am on the third night after the arrests, a Dutch investigator, Marinus Boekelo, was troubleshooting another bug that was causing error messages to cascade across the screen whenever someone used the search bar at the top of the page. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Boekelo muttered, bent over his laptop, his hands on either side of his face as he attempted one fix after another.Then, after a moment, he leaned back with a look of relief. The error messages were gone. The last serious bug had been ironed out.\nAfter nearly 72 hours, they had the reconstructed site running smoothly, fully under their command. The skeleton crew still working in the conference room exploded with jubilation. Aside from the one brief period of downtime, the migration of the site to a Dutch data center had been nearly invisible to its users.\nThe most conspicuous sign of the takeover, the Dutch police worried, was that for almost three days there had been complete radio silence from the two Hansa administrators. The site’s staff of four moderators looked to the two admins for orders and to resolve any disputes between buyers and dealers that they couldn’t handle themselves. The police could see that the admins communicated with Hansa’s staff using an encrypted messaging system called Tox Chat—the server they’d seized contained some limited logs of their past communications—but they didn’t have the password to log in to their chat accounts.\nSo they tried a simple solution: They asked the real admins for help. The two German men quickly agreed to cooperate in hopes of a lighter sentence. They handed over their Tox Chat passwords to the German police, who passed them on to the Dutch. The team in Driebergen then resumed day-to-day chatter between the bustling black market’s bosses and staff. With the cooperation of the real admins and their Tox Chat logs, they were able to pick up the business of the site without a hitch. Their only initial error was paying one moderator the incorrect amount for his Bitcoin salary, pegged to the wrong non-digital currency. The undercover police fixed their mistake, paid the staffer the difference, and all was forgiven.\nThe Dutch team had come up with a cover story for the admins’ three days offline: They’d tell anyone who asked that they were heads-down, coding an upgrade to the market. But no one asked. The hierarchy of the marketplace’s org chart and the secrecy of dark-web operations, where no one on staff knew their coworkers beyond a username and a shared chat history, meant the cops in admin clothing were spared any curious questions about their absence.\nNor, they were relieved to discover, did there seem to be any inside jokes or watercooler gossip to catch up on. “It actually turned out that they did not discuss anything personal with each other,” one investigator remembers. “It was pure business.”\nThe cover story about an upgrade wasn’t exactly a lie. In reconstructing the site, the Dutch police had actually ironed out some of its bugs and rewritten parts of its code to be more efficient. And because they now had a team of half a dozen rotating agents acting as the administrators, instead of two overworked individuals, they found that the site’s customers considered the day-to-day operations of the market to be significantly improved.\nOne of the younger Dutch agents had been an IT help-desk admin years earlier. He found his new job helping run Hansa to be remarkably similar. He got to work efficiently resolving disputes over the site’s drug deals, assisted by a collection of answers the administrators had helpfully prepared in an online control panel. The undercover agent even came to the rescue of one grateful, sight-impaired drug dealer, helping him figure out how to get his screen reader software properly integrated with his Tor browser.Ethical quandaries aside, the team couldn’t help but take pride in the professionalism of their work. “The quality really went up,” said Gert Ras, the head of the Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit. “Everyone was very satisfied with the level of service they got.”\nFOR THEIR FIRST day acting as Hansa’s bosses, the team had cautiously watched the site’s internal clockwork, barely believing that they’d gotten away with their takeover. But when it became clear they could control Hansa seemingly indefinitely, they settled in, working in shifts to run the site 24/7 from the small conference room in Driebergen.\nOn one wall, they set up a 65-inch screen where someone started a stopwatch, measuring exactly how long they’d been in control of the market. Then slowly, silently, they began to spring the trap they’d assembled.\nHansa, like any good dark-web market, had been designed to learn as little as possible about its users beyond what was necessary to facilitate reliable drug transactions. The passwords for users’ accounts were stored only as cryptographic “hashes,” indecipherable strings of characters that let the site avoid having to protect a collection of those sensitive login credentials. Hansa also offered to let users automatically encrypt all their messages using the privacy program PGP—including, most importantly, the mailing addresses buyers would share with sellers when they made an order. All of this meant that, in theory, the site itself would never have full access to its users’ accounts or know their most personal data, such as the location of their homes.\nNow the police began to invisibly sabotage those safeguards. They started recording all of Hansa’s usernames and passwords when buyers and sellers logged in. They also began secretly archiving the full text of every message that users sent on the site before the text was encrypted. Soon they were collecting hundreds, then thousands, of buyers’ addresses from orders, turning the business of the entire market into a glass aquarium under their real-time surveillance.\nAccording to Dutch law, the police had to record and attempt to intercept every drug order made on the market while they controlled it. So the half-dozen undercover agents in their small conference room were soon joined by dozens of others, working on the same floor, who were tasked with manually cataloging every single purchase. They forwarded the data from sales destined for the Netherlands to Dutch police, who could seize the packages of heroin, cocaine, and meth shipped through domestic mail. Non-Dutch orders would be sent to Europol, which was charged with distributing the ever-growing pile of drug-deal data to their respective nations’ law enforcement agencies.\nAlready, the Dutch police had accomplished something law enforcement had never attempted before: hunting, capturing, and vivisecting a dark-web drug market in real time, unbeknownst to the site’s users. But Operation Bayonet was only getting started. The Dutch—and their collaborators from Sacramento to Bangkok—had other, bigger game in their crosshairs.\nCHAPTER 9\n‘Advanced Analysis’\nON JUNE 22, 2017, two days after the Hansa takeover and less than two weeks before the date of the planned AlphaBay takedown, Michael Gronager and Jonathan Levin, cofounders of the world’s leading cryptocurrency tracing firm, Chainalysis, happened to be in the Netherlands. So was an Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations agent named Tigran Gambaryan. They had all flown to The Hague, halfway across the small country from the Driebergen office where the Dutch were pulling Hansa’s puppet strings, for a Europol conference focused on virtual currency investigations.\nAs contractors with no security clearance, Levin and Gronager were unaware of what Gambaryan knew: that by this time, all the interlocking pieces of Operation Bayonet were falling into place. The Dutch Hansa takeover was underway. A team of Americans targeting AlphaBay planned to set up surveillance of that market’s Dutch servers early on July 5, taking a snapshot of its contents while Cazes was logged in to it. They would pull it offline only after the Thais arrested Cazes in Bangkok; touching it any sooner might spook him and cause him to destroy evidence or flee. US prosecutors would then interrogate Cazes and swiftly extradite him. Even the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been roped in to simultaneously search Cazes’ mother’s home in Quebec.Gambaryan was only on the periphery of this international whirlwind of detective work. A compact former forensic accountant with a gruff demeanor, he had gained a reputation as a highly capable dark-web investigator and the IRS’s top Bitcoin whisperer. A few years earlier, he’d pioneered the first real cryptocurrency-tracing criminal case, following Bitcoin trails to prove that two federal agents assigned to investigate the Silk Road dark-web market had in fact pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of the market’s bitcoins through theft, extortion, and sales of insider information.\nGambaryan worked as part of IRS Criminal Investigations’ cybercrime unit in DC, but he had learned about the AlphaBay case early on from a friendly IRS agent in Fresno, California, his hometown, where he often went to visit his parents. He’d followed the investigation’s progress, but he’d never been assigned to the case.\nStill, he couldn’t help but take an occasional, curious poke at the biggest dark-web market in history. For months, Gambaryan had followed AlphaBay’s tracks through the blockchain, obsessively pestering Chainalysis’ Jonathan Levin with new ideas about how to circumscribe the edges of the AlphaBay “cluster”—the millions of Bitcoin addresses the site and its users had generated—or trace its most incriminating money trails. He was, as Levin put it, “completely relentless.”\nThat spring, Gambaryan and Levin had together come up with an idea—a new, experimental method to examine AlphaBay’s use of cryptocurrency. Prosecutors in the AlphaBay case have referred to it using only the hideously vague term “advanced analysis.” But Gambaryan and Levin hoped they could use it to unearth a major finding: the IP address of the server that hosted AlphaBay’s Bitcoin wallet. With that IP in hand, they should be able to pinpoint the server’s physical location and seize it, gaining key evidence in their case against Cazes and assuring that no one else on AlphaBay’s staff would be able to take control of the site after Cazes’ arrest.\nBy all conventional wisdom, it shouldn’t have been possible to learn that IP address through blockchain surveillance. The blockchain, after all, is a ledger of transactions between Bitcoin addresses. It doesn’t record IP addresses, the strings of numbers that identify individual computers on the internet and can often help investigators locate them. But Levin and Gambaryan’s method could somehow obtain those identifiers. Neither has revealed a word of how this technique works. In fact, in our conversations, they never treated any piece of cryptocurrency-tracing tradecraft with more secrecy.\nUnbeknownst to Levin, by the spring of 2017 the Operation Bayonet team believed they already knew an AlphaBay IP address: the one in the Netherlands that had once been leaked in the welcome email for the site’s forums and then in November 2016 passed on by a tipster to Fresno DEA agent Robert Miller. But Gambaryan figured it couldn’t hurt to independently verify this critical piece of evidence. Levin had been doing his own hands-on research into AlphaBay for years, and he was eager to try out a new investigative technique that Chainalysis could potentially sell to other customers.On that June morning in The Hague, Levin sat at a desk in an apartment in the coastal city’s quiet western periphery, a few blocks from the beach, next to a fishing harbor that fed into the wind-churned North Sea. Levin and Gronager had rented the Airbnb and were sharing it—more out of habit than financial necessity, given Chainalysis’ recent multimillion-dollar funding rounds and swelling cash flow—with one staying in the bedroom and the other on the couch.\nLevin and Gronager were both up early, before the Europol conference began. So Levin used this spare moment to check the results of his and Gambaryan’s advanced analysis experiment.\nThe answer appeared, without fanfare, on Levin’s screen: an AlphaBay IP address. Or rather, a handful of IP addresses that were likely to belong to the site’s wallet server. A quick search revealed that the likeliest of them wasn’t, in fact, in the Netherlands, but in a data center in Lithuania.\nLevin remembers his reaction in the moment as less of an epiphany than a brief flash of recognition. “Huh,” he thought to himself. He had no clue that the coordinated global raid of AlphaBay was planned for just over 10 days later and that, according to the digits he now saw on his screen, it was targeting a server in the wrong country. He made a mental note to tell Gambaryan about the Lithuanian IP the next time he saw him.\nThe opportunity arrived that evening. After a day spent at the Europol conference, the two sat side by side at dinner with a dozen other agents, analysts, prosecutors, and contractors around a long table at Flavor’s, a ribs-and-steak restaurant a few blocks from Europol headquarters, its walls covered in paintings of a medieval feast. They had just ordered drinks when Levin thought to mention to Gambaryan that their experimental idea had apparently worked. He showed Gambaryan the three IP addresses on his phone, pointing out the Lithuanian one that seemed most likely.\nThe IRS agent went silent. He pulled out his own phone and took a picture of Levin’s screen. Then he stood up, blank-faced, and quickly walked out of the restaurant without explanation.\nLevin watched him go, dumbfounded. Gambaryan hadn’t even paid for his beer.\nGAMBARYAN RAN THE eight blocks through the streets of the residential neighborhood, past The Hague’s art museum, to the Marriott next to Europol headquarters, where he and most of the other international agents at the conference were staying. He went directly to the building’s top floor, overlooking the darkened forest of Park Sorghvliet, ringed by international government buildings. At a table in an empty conference room, he opened his laptop, confirmed that the IP address Levin had found was indeed in a Lithuanian data center, and then began calling Operation Bayonet’s prosecutors—Grant Rabenn and Paul Hemesath in California, as well as Alden Pelker, the DC-based cybercrime attorney on the case, and Erin, the FBI Bitcoin-tracing analyst who was in The Hague attending the Europol conference—to tell them that he and Chainalysis had found what appeared to be the true location of AlphaBay’s central server, and it wasn’t in the Netherlands but a thousand miles to the east.Soon Erin joined Gambaryan in the hotel conference room, with Hemesath and Rabenn on speakerphone from California, where it was still early in the day. Chainalysis’ Levin arrived not long after, followed by Gronager, who’d been attending a different business dinner; both men were pulled into the night’s meeting on a need-to-know basis. Until the early hours of the morning, the group worked frantically to sort out the logistics of seizing AlphaBay’s infrastructure not from the Netherlands, as they’d intended, but from Lithuania, with their July 5 deadline just days away. At one point, a Dutch hotel worker came into the lounge to try to tell the group the room was closed. Gambaryan, who technically wasn’t even part of the AlphaBay operation, flashed his badge at the man instinctively—a badge that had no actual authority outside the United States—and the startled Dutchman retreated, leaving them to their work.\nJust as they were on the cusp of victory, it seemed their plan had failed. \n“Oh, shit,” Rabenn silently concluded, in a state of blank panic. “This thing’s over.”\nUltimately, Gambaryan and Chainalysis’ advanced analysis trick spared Operation Bayonet, at nearly the last minute, from what could have been a major error. The investigators would later learn that the Netherlands IP address they’d been focused on for months pointed to a data center that held only an older server for the site, rather than the holy grail they were looking for. Just like Hansa, AlphaBay had apparently moved at some point from a Dutch hosting provider to the Baltics. Without the Lithuanian IP address, passed from Levin’s phone to Gambaryan’s in a steak restaurant, the investigators would have been raiding the equivalent of an abandoned hideout, leaving AlphaBay’s actual criminal headquarters untouched.\nNone of the investigators in Operation Bayonet has ever explained the mechanics of that Hail Mary advanced-analysis technique publicly—nor would they explain it to me in the years that followed. That’s in part because the secrecy of the technique, agents and prosecutors suggested, had allowed it to be used again and again, identifying the IP addresses of dark-web services’ Bitcoin wallets in a series of major cases. Law enforcement agencies wanted to make sure the method wasn’t “burned”—exposed to dark-web administrators or Bitcoin developers who might be able to fix the vulnerabilities it exploited.\nFor anyone who followed the early days of Chainalysis, though, it would be hard not to take one particular educated guess at how the company’s mysterious tool worked. In 2015, just months after its founding, the startup had caused a brief, very public blowup in the Bitcoin community with a technique capable of identifying Bitcoin users’ IP addresses. The company had set up its own secret collection of Bitcoin nodes, the computers that serve as the communications backbone of the Bitcoin network. Unlike typical Bitcoin nodes, Chainalysis’ nodes were designed to silently record the IP addresses Bitcoin users broadcast with every transaction. By quietly intercepting every IP that passed through the nodes, Chainalysis aimed to create a global map of Bitcoin users’ physical locations.\nThe IP eavesdropping was meant as a demonstration of the young startup’s capabilities. When it was discovered, however, the result was a long, venom-filled thread on the cryptocurrency forum BitcoinTalk, where Chainalysis was excoriated as a purveyor of “mass surveillance” tools. Gronager, the company’s CEO, apologized and shut down the experiment.\nYet, years later, could that technique somehow have been adapted to secretly target—and locate—the Bitcoin wallets of very specific users? Even when the transactions were sent from a computer running on the Tor anonymity network?For Operation Bayonet, all that mattered was that the IRS’s Gambaryan and Chainalysis’ Levin had, together, corrected the course of a massive, coordinated, international investigation at a critical moment, deploying a secret weapon with hardly a day to spare. But secret weapons don’t tend to stay secret forever.\nCHAPTER 10\nThe Athenee\nIN THE LAST days of June, the Americans descended upon Bangkok like a tropical law enforcement convention.\nThey included nearly 20 agents, analysts, computer forensic experts, and prosecutors from the FBI, DEA, IRS, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police. More than a dozen members of the group checked in at the Athenee, a five-star hotel a few blocks from the US embassy, which advertised that it was built on grounds once owned by a 19th-century Siamese princess and featured eight restaurants and a rooftop complete with a garden and swimming pool. It was, the prosecutor Grant Rabenn noted, certainly the nicest hotel he’d ever managed to book on the government’s per diem.\nWith just days until their planned bust, Rabenn, Hemesath, and the DC prosecutor Louisa Marion remained swamped by the bureaucracy of coordinating law enforcement agencies in five countries—the United States, Thailand, Canada, the Netherlands, and now Lithuania, where they had a fresh plan to seize the central AlphaBay server. The team also met repeatedly with the Thais at the headquarters of their Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB) across town, gathering in a conference room on the building’s eighth floor to talk through the details of Cazes’ arrest.\nThe central problem remained unsolved: how to distract Cazes and lure him out of his house with his phone unlocked and his laptop open and unencrypted. Set fire to a dumpster outside the house? Too dangerous, they decided. Have a female undercover agent begin screaming and crying outside his house? Cazes might simply ignore her, or else close the laptop before checking out the noise.What if they dressed an undercover agent as a postal worker who knocked on the door and asked Cazes to come sign for a package? That, they concluded, might work.\nAmid all this frantic eleventh-hour planning, a core group still managed to cap off each day at the Athenee’s lounge for its all-you-can-eat sushi happy hours. It was during one of those evening gatherings that something surprising appeared in the group chat the Thai police had set up on a messaging app called Line, popular in Thailand. The Thais used the group chat to post constant updates to one another and to the DEA on their physical surveillance of Cazes. That day, the Thai team assigned to Operation Bayonet had been following their target on an early evening outing, tracking him in his Porsche Panamera as he approached central Bangkok. Jen Sanchez, who lived near both the Athenee and her workplace at the US embassy building down the street, had just returned home when she saw a photo, taken by one of the Thai officers, pop up. It showed a white Porsche, parked at a swanky-looking hotel entrance.\n“What the fuck?” she thought, with a sudden rush of adrenaline. Wasn’t that the Athenee, where much of the US team was staying?\nAt that moment, in the Athenee lounge, Rabenn recalls seeing the same Porsche out of the corner of his peripheral vision and instantly remembering that a white Panamera was in Cazes’ stable of pricey vehicles. He pointed it out to Hemesath, as well as the DEA’s Miller and an FBI agent, all of them sitting together at a table in the lobby. They half-jokingly suggested that the FBI agent go check it out.\nThe agent gamely strolled across the lounge as a figure walked through the front door of the Athenee. A spasm of shock went through Rabenn’s mind.\nIt was him. Alexandre Cazes. And he was walking directly toward Rabenn, Miller, and Hemesath’s table.\nRabenn froze. “It was like seeing a ghost,” he remembers. He glanced over at Hemesath, who seemed equally paralyzed, in disbelief.\nThe image of that first in-person encounter with Cazes, after nine months of obsessively tracking Alpha02, remains burned into Rabenn’s memory. Cazes was dressed, Rabenn remembers, in a slim, expensive-looking blue suit, his white shirt unbuttoned underneath in the style of someone too rich to wear a tie. Yet Rabenn also observed that Cazes moved with a certain nerdy awkwardness—that, under his costume, he looked “more like a pudgy programmer pretending to be a rock star than an actual rock star.”\nThe FBI agent, thinking quickly, avoided eye contact with Cazes and walked directly past him to the door. In the seconds it took for Cazes to cross the room, seemingly in slow motion, thoughts raced through Rabenn’s mind: How did Cazes know who they were? Or that they were on his trail? Or which hotel they were staying at in Bangkok? Had there been a leak? Had they been meeting too conspicuously, blowing their opsec? Had this criminal mastermind outsmarted them?In mere moments, Rabenn expected Cazes to sit down next to them at their table, smug expression on his face, and say, as he imagined it, “Fuck you guys, I know you’re here, and you’re not going to get anything.”\nRabenn realized he had no idea how he would respond. They could arrest Cazes on the spot, but they’d lose all hope of getting access to his laptop or any smoking-gun evidence of his control of AlphaBay. Just as they were on the cusp of victory, it seemed their plan had failed.\n“Oh, shit,” Rabenn silently concluded, in a state of blank panic. “This thing’s over.”\nThen, when Cazes was about 5 feet away from their table, he turned and sat down at the table next to them, across from a pair of Israeli businessmen wearing suits and yarmulkes.\nThe Americans looked at each other in confusion. After a moment, the FBI agent returned and sat down casually. He and Miller began silently signaling to the rest of the table that everyone else should leave.\nRabenn, recovering his composure, allowed the thought to cross his mind that perhaps all was not lost—that this was simply the most stunning coincidence of his life.\nDoing their best to act naturally, the prosecutors cleared out and walked up the curved staircase to the mezzanine floor of the hotel, while the FBI agent and Miller hung back to eavesdrop on Cazes’ conversation at the neighboring table. On the floor above, Rabenn and Hemesath shared a moment of wide-eyed relief. Text messages from the FBI and DEA agents still at the table began to roll in, reporting on Cazes’ meeting: He was talking with the Israelis about one of his real estate investment deals in the Caribbean.\nAs their panic subsided, they now saw that a group of Thai undercover police—including the team leader, Colonel Pisal Erb-Arb, in plain clothes—had stationed themselves around another table across the hotel lounge from Cazes and were discreetly watching him, even stealthily taking photos of each other that captured Cazes in the background. The AlphaBay founder gave no sign of having spotted them.\nAs Rabenn and Hemesath silently rejoiced, the FBI agent joined them on the mezzanine floor and pulled out his phone. He started Googling, trying to calculate the odds of what had just happened. How many hotels were there in Bangkok, anyway? He quickly showed them the answer: There were thousands.\nIn a euphoric daze, the two prosecutors marveled at their bizarre near-collision—but not for long. In two days, they knew their team would be encountering Cazes face-to-face again, this time in the most elaborate arrest they had ever attempted.\nContinued next week: The day of the takedown arrives. Operation Bayonet reaches its kinetic climax. And then the case takes a tragic twist.\nThis story is excerpted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available now from Doubleday.\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Ghosts in the Machine","detailed_content":"REMEMBER Libra, Meta’s ambitious plan to enter the cryptocurrency market? Or Lasso, Meta’s ambitious attempt to outdo TikTok? Alongside projects like Shops, Meta’s ambitious plan to turn Instagram and Facebook into e-ommerce giants; its podcast plans; Facebook Portal and a Meta smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch, they all failed.\nIn pursuit of becoming the everything platform, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has thrown a lot of stuff at the wall. Precious little of it has stuck, except for the headcount brought to work on these projects.\nYesterday, Zuckerberg announced mammoth layoffs at Meta: 11,000 people in all—some 13 percent of the company and nearly three times the number let go by Twitter, which fired 50 percent of its workforce on November 4. He blamed his own decision to increase investments and an ad revenue crunch caused by Apple’s decision to give users more control over how their personal information is used for advertising purposes.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nThis Heart is Not Human\nBut that only tells part of the story, according to company insiders and people tracking the company’s business from the outside. “Today’s news isn’t only a correction of the pandemic years,” says one former Meta employee with knowledge of the company’s operations, who left shortly before the layoffs were announced and spoke anonymously because his current employer would not grant him the right to speak on the record to WIRED. “I would say it’s probably the last five to 10 years”—originating even before Zuckerberg’s Metaverse obsession. Some of the losses can be attributed to the sheer range of risky and failed experiments the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram parent company has conducted over the years, the former employee says. “I just can’t think in the last five years of a successful Meta app or feature that wasn’t acquired,” the ex-employee says—before suggesting Stories, perhaps, which itself was borrowed from Snapchat.\nThose distractions from Meta’s core business are what the former employee says are harming the company—and are why the layoffs this week were quite so significant. Had there been natural attrition as each attempt to innovate failed and fell by the wayside, the reduction in staff numbers would have been stretched out over time. “We just launched this huge blockchain initiative that required hundreds of people—or maybe even more,” says the former employee. “When that thing went away, what happened to those people? They just kind of stayed and worked on other experiments and research.” The former employee cites issues with internal communication that suggested people drifted off into obscurity within the massive Meta machine. “It seemed like we were doing all these things that went nowhere, but we never got an update of: ‘It went nowhere, but here’s the actions we’re taking’,” he says.\nNew projects helped Facebook to accumulate employees rapidly. Flush with cash as one of the world’s biggest companies, and with big plans for dominating all aspects of consumers’ lives, the company formerly known as Facebook hired plentifully. In 2017, Meta employed 25,000 staff. And before it sliced 11,000 from its payroll, it had 87,000 employees. The company has grown headcount by an average of 28 percent in each of the last five years. Even after these latest cuts, the newly slimmed-down Meta is still three times as large as it was in 2017.“They’ve overhired and are trying a lot of different things,” says Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School. “Mark Zuckerberg right now is not clear about what he wants from his company.” George points to the rebranding of Facebook as Meta as an example of the uncertainty around the future direction of the company: “It sent signals that maybe he felt that Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp had tapered off, and that he wanted to move to VR. But that obviously has not paid off yet.” Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA former Meta engineer, who left before this week’s cull, tells WIRED they were brought into the company to work on a project that months later was canned. The engineer was left to float within the company.\n“Meta layoffs are an ominous sign of dark days ahead for Zuckerberg,” says Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. Both he and George of Harvard question Zuckerberg’s decision to go all in on the metaverse.\n“I believe that Mark needs to be chairman and give up the CEO job and bring in a professional CEO,” George says. Other tech companies have successfully divided the roles of founder and CEO, he says, including Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Oracle. “I think Mark could concentrate on his dream for Meta, but at the same time, somebody\u0027s got to run the business and many of his advertisers are pulling out,” he says. “And that\u0027s where the revenue comes from.”\nThat bloat, and the ghosts in the machine that it left, has been Meta’s fatal flaw, the former employee suggests. “The company just kept growing and growing,” he says. “No one seriously thought: ‘Why are we growing? Do we actually need the people we’re hiring, or are we just hiring because we like to hire?’”","tags":["","FACEBOOK","SILICON VALLEY","MARK ZUCKERBERG"],"author":"BY CHRIS STOKEL-WALKER","creation_date":"2022-11-10"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-574/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"This week on Gadget Lab, we do our best to break down the social media platform many Twitter users are flocking to.","title":"What You Should Know About Switching to Mastodon","detailed_content":"AMID ALL THE Twitter hubbub, the lesser known social site Mastodon has seen a surge of new users.

If there\u0027s a server for Swedish psych pop.\nLauren Goode: You are never going to live down Swedish psych pop. I think you mentioned that at a conference, in like a mixed crowd a few years ago, and now you\u0027re just Swedish psych pop guy.\nMichael Calore: I am perfectly happy with that.\nLauren Goode: I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a Mastodon server for Swedish psych pop, but I am curious whether or not you think we could technically set one up in the time it takes to record this podcast.\nMichael Calore: Maybe.\nLauren Goode: Probably not.\nMichael Calore: I don\u0027t really know much about it.\nLauren Goode: Well, on the upside, someone is going to demystify Mastodon for us today.\nMichael Calore: Sweet. Let\u0027s do it.\n[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]\nLauren Goode: Hi everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I\u0027m Lauren Goode. I\u0027m a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: And I\u0027m Michael Calore. I\u0027m a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: We\u0027re also joined this week by WIRED senior editor Andrew Couts, who is coming to us from a hamlet in upstate New York.\nAndrew Couts: Hi, everybody.\nLauren Goode: I just wanted to say hamlet. Hey, Andrew. How many people live in this hamlet?\nAndrew Couts: 188.\nLauren Goode: Seriously?\nAndrew Couts: Yes.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s incredible. Are you like mayor there?\nAndrew Couts: Nope, but I probably could be if I wanted to. I don\u0027t know if we even have a mayor. We have a board, but it\u0027s very small. It\u0027s quaint. It\u0027s nice.\nLauren Goode: I\u0027m willing to bet that of everyone who lives in your hamlet, you have the most followers on Mastodon.\nAndrew Couts: That is probably true. I kind of hope it\u0027s true, because if it\u0027s not, then that means my neighbors are weirder than I think they are.\nLauren Goode: And you need to go friend them immediately. All right, well, we\u0027ve definitely tipped off what we\u0027re talking about today. Right now, if you\u0027re active on any popular social media platform like Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, you\u0027re using a centralized social media app. What does this even mean? Basically, it means that one body or one corporation holds all the power over that network. It might also mean that you really experience one primary feed when you log on to the app, but in the first two extremely chaotic weeks of Elon Musk\u0027s ownership of Twitter, another narrative has emerged, one about decentralized social media apps. And one in particular, it\u0027s called Mastodon. Now Mastodon looks and feels a little like Twitter, but it\u0027s pretty different at its core, so we\u0027ve invited Andrew on to talk about it—because Andrew, I think you, like me, spent all weekend banging your head against the keyboard trying to figure out Mastodon. Is that correct?Andrew Couts: Yes. I have spent far too much time on Mastodon. I think my weekly screen report said I was up 16 percent over the past week, and almost all of that was spent on Mastodon, and definitely the most increase was on Mastodon. I am a little bit obsessed with it.\nLauren Goode: OK, so what is it?\nAndrew Couts: So Mastodon is, like you said, a decentralized social network. It looks very similar to Twitter in a lot of ways. It has some different vocabularies, it has some different rules or at least social norms than Twitter does, but overall, it\u0027s a very similar experience. The big difference is the decentralized bit, which means that my account might exist on a different server than your account, but they can talk to each other, and there\u0027s no reason to be too concerned about that. It\u0027s just a little bit different in the way it\u0027s set up, and it can have big implications for content moderation and all types of different aspects that make up our overall social experience there.\nMichael Calore: So the thing that people often talk about when they talk about Twitter, and the thing that I would argue makes Twitter special, is its role as the great public square of the internet. It\u0027s the place where everybody is hanging out in the same spot talking about whatever they want to talk about with their individual communities inside that public square, but there\u0027s no fence that you have to hop over to go from one community to another. It\u0027s just one big community. So how is Mastodon different in that way? How much of a public square can it be?\nAndrew Couts: I think it could be the same kind of public square as Twitter. There\u0027s very little friction between the different servers, and really you don\u0027t recognize when you\u0027re talking to somebody on a different server than the one you\u0027re on. It all looks the same, and you can follow people from different servers. There is the option for a server to not be connected to the network, so you could have your own little social network with only people who know your server and it never communicates with another server. That\u0027s something somebody could do. However, it\u0027s really easy to connect a server to another one. For example, if I boosted a post from Lauren\u0027s server, and a boost is very similar to a retweet, that would automatically connect her Mastodon instance or Mastodon server to the rest of the Mastodon network. And so just as little as a retweet or a boost is something that can introduce your server to the rest of the Mastodon ecosystem, which is then part of a bigger, they call it a Fediverse, that are other applications that are on top of this thing. All these terms are what make this all a big barrier to entry for people, and it makes it really confusing, but it\u0027s not really that complicated once you\u0027re actually using it.Lauren Goode: So take us through some of these wonky terms. You mentioned boosts. They are also something called toots. There\u0027s the Fediverse. What do we need to know?\nAndrew Couts: Toots is the, I would say, unfortunate word for tweet. And honestly, I think it\u0027s going out of favor. People are just saying post, and it\u0027s kind of normalizing it, but Mastodon\u0027s been around since I believe 2017.\n[Correction, 11:23 am on 11/10/22: Mastodon has been around since 2016, actually.]\nAndrew Couts: And so it developed its own little culture. And until we all invaded that space over the past two weeks, they had their own little ways and norms that were, I think, really smart and wise in some ways to keep it a good community. But other things, like “toot.” might go out of favor. The Fediverse is the name for everything that is connected that\u0027s using the same protocol as Mastodon. And so you can have a video-sharing platform or a photo-sharing platform, and those exist on the Fediverse, and you can connect your Mastodon account to those accounts and use the internet a little bit differently with these decentralized social media apps.\nLauren Goode: And that\u0027s short for Federated Universe, is that correct?\nAndrew Couts: Yes, that\u0027s correct. Sorry, I should explain that. “Federated” is what it means when … I\u0027m going to botch this, and someone\u0027s going to yell at me. But basically, it just means that it\u0027s a bunch of networks that are connected together where you can see everything that\u0027s on all the connected networks.\nMichael Calore: So when I log to Mastodon and I land on my server, what do I see? Do I just see the people\u0027s posts on my server, or do I see people\u0027s posts from the Fediverse? Is there a way to select what I see? Because when you show up on Twitter, there\u0027s this algorithmically generated stream that shows me all of the tweets of all the people that I\u0027m following. Or if I\u0027m not following a lot of people, it suggests a bunch of people for me to follow. What\u0027s the login experience like on Mastodon? What do I see when I show up?\nAndrew Couts: So when you first log in, you will only be able to see posts from everyone on your server. So for example, I\u0027m on the mastodon.socialserver. I believe that\u0027s the first one that was set up, and it\u0027s one of the largest, if not the largest server. So everybody who is on there, I can see it on my local tab, so “local” is everybody on your server. There\u0027s also the Federated tab that will show you everybody within all of Mastodon. And then there\u0027s your home tab, which is the one that I use most frequently now that I have a good number of people I\u0027m following. And so the home tab is just people you follow regardless of what server they\u0027re on, so it\u0027s going to be the most similar to what you see on your Twitter feed based on who you follow. So the home tab is where it\u0027s at.Lauren Goode: So even though this is a decentralized network, I\u0027m curious about who runs it and who funds it. Is there any kind of leadership or chief executive or, as Elon Musk is now describing himself, like the chief hotline? What is a chief complaint hotline operator? Is there someone you can basically ring up or drop a line to and say like, “Hey, I want to talk to you about this,” and who is funding Mastodon?\nAndrew Couts: So nobody owns Mastodon overall. It\u0027s basically a protocol, and then whoever runs your server owns that instance of Mastodon. And so that\u0027s one of the things that makes it a lot different than Twitter. There\u0027s no one person to complain to. Probably if you were going to say, \"Hey, I\u0027m getting harassed by a bunch of trolls,\" you would go to the admins of your server. There is somebody who founded Mastodon and kind of is in charge. His name\u0027s Eugen Rochko,  and he\u0027s the main developer and the main person behind Mastodon. But only in the, I believe, the Mastodon.social instance or any other one that he\u0027s involved in would you want to complain directly to him. He\u0027s really active on Mastodon. I think he seems pretty accessible. But in general, you\u0027re going to want to talk to whoever the admins are of your instance, or you could start your own instance and you could complain to yourself.\nLauren Goode: And what about funding?\nAndrew Couts: I don\u0027t actually know the answer to that. It\u0027s a nonprofit, so I believe it\u0027s mostly crowdsourced funding. I know they have a Patreon page, and so that\u0027s who you would be giving to. You would be giving to the main Mastodon nonprofit. But besides that, I\u0027m sure that there are Patreon pages for individual servers, individual instances, and it\u0027s mostly just a crowdfunded thing. Nobody owns it, so there\u0027s nobody to pay or anything of that nature. You\u0027re not going to be charged $8 for using Mastodon. And if you were, you could move to another Mastodon server and ignore that.\nLauren Goode: All right. Well, we have to take a quick break, but when we come back, we\u0027re going to talk more about this whole concept of a decentralized social network.\n[Break]\nLauren Goode: Mike, do you have a better idea now of what Mastodon is?\nMichael Calore: Yes, it\u0027s all becoming clear to me.\nLauren Goode: Are you ready to join your Swedish psych pop server? Maybe you can start one.\nMichael Calore: I could start one, yes. It would be like me and four other turbo nerds.\nLauren Goode: All right. Well, I want to talk to Andrew more about what it means to be on a decentralized social network, and if it\u0027s self-governed, how secure that all is. Andrew, what would you say are the biggest considerations that people should have when they join something that is decentralized?Andrew Couts: The biggest thing to consider when joining a decentralized network is to recognize that the person who runs your instance or server or the people who run it have access to everything you do there. This is also true with Twitter, and it\u0027s one of the big reasons why everyone is fleeing now that Elon Musk is the person who controls that on Twitter. But on Mastodon, you have any number of people who can control that depending on what instance you\u0027re on, so it\u0027s really you need to trust who your instance admins are, and that\u0027s a big reason why a lot of people are starting their own instances, because they don\u0027t want somebody else to be in control of their direct messages, things like that. Another thing I would say about … This isn\u0027t about decentralized networks in general, but one thing about Mastodon is that direct messages work a lot differently. DMs are posts, but you just control who can see those posts, and you can set it to be only the people who are mentioned within those posts. If you happen to mention another user, you put their at handle in there, they will automatically be included in those DMs. So you don\u0027t want to go talking behind somebody\u0027s back and mention them in a DM, because they\u0027re going to get access to that DM, as an example. Again, as a security editor, I\u0027m always recommending that if you really want to say something private, don\u0027t say it on a social network regardless. Take it to Signal. You could take it to WhatsApp or even Telegram, where things are, to one degree or another, end-to-end encrypted. That\u0027s where you want to keep your private messages. But just one thing to know about Mastodon is that DMs work a little bit differently, and they might surprise you how they work if you do it a little bit wrong.\nLauren Goode: In this case, is decentralization tied in any way to the blockchain? Is this a bigger part of the whole pitch around Web3?\nAndrew Couts: As far as I know, there\u0027s no direct connection between Mastodon and Web3 or the blockchain at this point. Decentralization is definitely something that is talked about as part of Web3, but it\u0027s decentralized in a slightly different way. We\u0027re not talking about blockchain-based technology, we\u0027re talking about a different protocol essentially.\nMichael Calore: How does moderation work on these servers? Because in a centralized model, if somebody is being a jerk on the platform, they get booted from the platform. So if somebody\u0027s being a jerk on my instance or on my server, and I boot him from my server, can he just go be a jerk somewhere else on somebody else\u0027s server?\nAndrew Couts: Moderation works a little bit differently on Mastodon. So to answer your question, yes, that person could go and sign up for another server. However, you also have the option to block entire servers. So for example, if some neo-Nazis created a Mastodon server where it\u0027s just a bunch of neo-Nazis, you could block that entire server and a lot of other people could block them too, and so they essentially get cut out from the main conversations, and they\u0027re not able to wage these campaigns, so there is some democratized moderation that happens. Moderation also happens at the server level. So whoever runs your instance or your server can create the rules that they want to create and enforce those rules how they say fit. They\u0027re the masters of their domain. I kind of think of instant admins as benevolent dictators and we are all in these little fiefdoms of Mastodon, and so they can enforce the rules how they want. You also have the ability as a user to block whoever you want to block, including blocking entire servers.Michael Calore: I want to play devil\u0027s advocate a little bit here and say that we\u0027ve tried in the past to build social environments on open-sourced, decentralized systems before on the internet. And some of them will survive if they\u0027re very well maintained and the community has a definite long-view purpose, like a list serve or a newsgroup that is still going. But for social media at a really large scale, it seems like the centralized platforms have always won. Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Hacker News. They all have owners. They all have rules. Those rules could change. We\u0027re sort of at their mercy. So I mean, I understand the vision, but practically, this can never be as big as Twitter.\nAndrew Couts: I would say practically speaking, it\u0027s going to be difficult for it to get to that scale. However, we\u0027ve already seen the network deal with a massive influx of people. I think they\u0027re up to over 6 million users at this point, which is far more than they had before Musk bought Twitter and everybody started fleeing, so it remains to be seen. It depends on how invested people get. If there are enough people willing to run servers, if there are enough people willing to pay to maintain those servers, then yeah, we could see it grow to be as large as Twitter, which is much smaller itself than Facebook or TikTok or a lot of other social networks, but it just remains to be seen. I\u0027m cautiously optimistic about Mastodon\u0027s potential. I think it really just depends on whether people stay interested when we\u0027re outside of this whirlwind of news and Musk seemingly doing some drastic shift every 10 seconds. We\u0027ll see how it goes, but so far so good. They\u0027ve survived this influx of people, and they\u0027ve been around for years now, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going anywhere. Whether everybody wants to keep using it, that remains to be seen.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, that\u0027s a good point.\nLauren Goode: I will say, despite the fact that Mastodon has been around since 2017, right now, it does have that chaotic, but good chaotic, energy right now. That early web, let\u0027s-fuck-around-and-find-out, let\u0027s tinker with things, look at this new feature, who else is here for the hang? It\u0027s kind of fun to spend time on once you get over that initial hurdle of finding a server and actually signing up, which took an entire weekend for me.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: I was just waiting and waiting for a verification email and it finally came through. Twitter feels chaotic right now, but it\u0027s a very dark timeline. We\u0027re taping this on election day, and so it\u0027s like, how is Twitter going to disrupt democracy yet again, and it\u0027s not a good chaotic energy, and Mastodon still feels new.\nMichael Calore: It\u0027s going to be a wild two years. I do think that a lot of that onboarding experience that you\u0027re talking about, Lauren, that is something that could be solved by a good user experience. And the barrier of the server, you need to find a server to hook up to, just the concept of that is very difficult for a lot of people to understand. So some of that can be solved with changing the name or creating a very clear signup flow. I haven\u0027t seen one yet. I\u0027m also curious about the apps, if there are good mobile apps for posting to Mastodon and browsing Mastodon, and how do those fit into the Federated environment and the decentralized environment?Andrew Couts: So just to go back to the user experience part for a moment, I think one of the things that makes … I agree with Lauren, one of the things that\u0027s really exciting about Mastodon is that it doesn\u0027t feel new, it feels old. It feels like the internet that I grew up with, and I think part of that is that there\u0027s not just passive consumption or even passive content creation. You can also build things for it. You can maintain your own server, but you can also create tools. And you see a lot of people doing that. There\u0027s a real creator energy to the space right now, and I think that having some greater control than you do over a centralized network and your experience there has really invigorated people to want to invest in a different way. And so I think that that\u0027s really exciting. And I think one of the ways we can see that evolving is people creating a better onboarding experience and not just being a few overworked engineers who work for the mass nonprofit there, it could be somebody else entirely who\u0027s completely independent, who just creates something that makes the users experience a lot better. I do think we\u0027ll see an evolution of the terms and people either getting familiar with things like instance and Fediverse and all that kind of stuff, or just people stopping using those terms and explaining it a little bit better. So we\u0027ll see how that goes. As far as the apps are concerned, there\u0027s a bunch of different apps. There\u0027s the main Mastodon app, which I don\u0027t actually like that much. I found it to be a little bit glitchy at this point. I\u0027m currently using one called Metatext, and it kind of has all the features that I would want on Twitter, to the extent that Mastodon mirrors those same experiences, and it\u0027s been really stable. I did have some lag last night. My personal take on it is that having to be patient a little bit with your tech isn\u0027t a bad thing. I\u0027ve kind of found it to be like, OK, it\u0027s not working right now. I\u0027m going to go do something else. And it kind of stops the cycle of doomscrolling. And it\u0027s like the glitch is the same as that random person on TikTok who jumps up and says, \"Hey, you\u0027ve been on TikTok for way too long, you dirt bag. Maybe go do something else and spend time with your family,\" or whatever they say. I always scroll past it too fast to know actually what the whole message is, but I think that there\u0027s … I found it to be more relaxing to have kind of a built-in pause button on my consumption of i,t because I did go a little bit overboard this weekend, so we\u0027ll see how it evolves. There\u0027s a bunch of other apps too, though. There\u0027s Toot, which is a paid app. I believe it\u0027s available on both iOS and Android, that a lot of people like. There\u0027s five or six of them on iOS. I think there\u0027s a few others. If you search the app stores, you\u0027ll be able to find them. I recommend Metatext. It\u0027s worked really well for me, and it\u0027s free. No in-app purchases or anything like that.Lauren Goode: Andrew, can I tell you something? Mike actually pays attention to those warnings when they pop up on his phone, where they\u0027re like, “Oh, you\u0027ve spent 15 minutes on this app. It\u0027s time to go do something else.” He actually heeds the warnings.\nMichael Calore: I do.\nLauren Goode: I don\u0027t know anyone else who does. It\u0027s amazingly disciplined. I admire it.\nMichael Calore: Well, thank you.\nLauren Goode: But to me, it\u0027s just hitting snooze. It\u0027s like …\nMichael Calore: It\u0027s just a good habit that I\u0027ve developed over the last three or four years. I don\u0027t know what it is. I just kind of trained my brain to do it. I know that not everybody can do it, but … The thing you\u0027re talking about, Andrew, reminds me of the fail whale. The early days of Twitter, when Twitter used to crash all the time, and then you sort of had to take a break from Twitter. And like you were saying, Lauren, it had that chaotic-in-a-good-way energy, because the fail whale could pop up at any time.\nLauren Goode: It\u0027s big whale energy.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. People were joining. People were like, “Hey, what\u0027s going on this side?” That kind of curiosity, not really knowing what to post. So it\u0027s been kind of fun to watch that happen elsewhere, even if I\u0027m doing it from afar.\nAndrew Couts: One of the things I\u0027ve liked about the Mastodon experience is people are willing to be earnest in a way that they were not on Twitter. People are just being a little bit more vulnerable or just being themselves or just saying things that they actually mean. It\u0027s not all just either yelling at each other or jokes or just people posting news or announcements or whatever it is that non-journalists do on Twitter. I found it to be just kind of refreshing in that way. One of the things I\u0027ve learned is that the way that the community has arisen is by being very much about communication and conversation, in a way that Twitter evolved to not be that, and evolved to be the worst place possible for that. And I think we\u0027re going to see changes there, and they\u0027re probably not going to be good ones. But at the moment, the DNA of the Mastodon community is trying to dictate it being a, not a friendly place necessarily, but a respectful place and a good place to have conversations. And I\u0027ve had the best interactions I\u0027ve had with people online on Mastodon over the past couple of weeks. I have to say, I hope that stays the same.\nLauren Goode: It really does feel like right now is the best of the internet and the worst of the internet all happening at once. All right, let\u0027s take another quick break. And when we come back, we\u0027re going to do our favorite segment: recommendations.[Break]\nLauren Goode: Andrew, you\u0027re up first. What is your recommendation this week?\nAndrew Couts: My recommendation, I\u0027m going to go with a classic gadget recommendation, is the Fi dog collars. The privacy side of my brain hates them because it tracks the location of my dogs and my phone constantly, so I\u0027m sure that there\u0027s good reasons to not want to use this device, but all my dogs got really fat, and this has made them get less fat. And I really like it. It tracks all their steps and everything. It makes it much easier to be a good, responsible dog owner and keep your dogs healthy, because you push them a little bit farther than you really want to on their walks and things like that, and it really helps your dogs stay trim. And it can also track them if they get lost, which mine have. Fortunately, knock on wood. But yeah, Fi dog collars.\nLauren Goode: We\u0027re going to need to know everything about your dogs quickly, their names. You can rattle them off Matt Damon-style and their ages and their breeds, please.\nAndrew Couts: Sure. I have three dogs. My first dog is Sajo. He\u0027s a 12-year-old German shepherd. We also have Lucho who is a 3-year-old German shepherd, and Truffle who is an 11-month-old yellow lab. Lucho and Truffle are both dropouts from Guiding Eyes for the Blind, which is a guide dog school where my wife runs the adoption program, so both of them had some slightly not guide dog traits, and so we got to adopt them when they were little puppies, and they\u0027re good.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s amazing. So Truffle, you said?\nAndrew Couts: Truffle, yes.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, It sounds like he was just being set on the path to be a wee bit pudgy.\nAndrew Couts: Yeah, and she came in after we got the Fi call for Lucho, who was the main fat one. Truffle is actually jacked. She\u0027s like a jacked little puppy because of Lucho. she weighs around 60 pounds. Lucho is a little over a 100 pounds, not fat, and so she thinks she\u0027s a 100-pound German shepherd and plays like one. She\u0027s the fittest of the bunch.\nLauren Goode: Oh, so she\u0027s going to stand on the podium with you when you accept your bid for mayor.\nAndrew Couts: Exactly.\nLauren Goode: How much do these collars cost?\nAndrew Couts: I think they\u0027re around $80, but there seems to be a perpetual sale, so I\u0027m not sure. And I think they just came out with a new one, the Series Three, which I have deemed not worth my money yet. So we\u0027ll see.\nLauren Goode: A series-three dog collar. Like they\u0027re Apple. This is the next generation. Good morning, this is our new dog collar.\nMichael Calore: We\u0027re all past the point now where it does not feel weird to do things like charge our dog collars or charge our basketball shoes or charge our surfboards.Lauren Goode: No, I do not charge a surfboard. All right, thanks again for that awesome recommendation. More dogs on Gadget Lab.\nMichael Calore: More dogs.\nLauren Goode: Mike, what\u0027s your recommendation this week?\nMichael Calore: I\u0027m going to recommend a book. It\u0027s a book that I just finished. It\u0027s called So Much Things to Say: The Oral History of Bob Marley, and it\u0027s written by Roger Steffens. It\u0027s an oral history, so it\u0027s a book of interviews, but our guide through the history of Bob Marley\u0027s life is Roger Steffens, who is a longtime broadcaster, reggae scholar, and one of the world experts on Bob Marley and that world of Jamaican music known as reggae music, which I\u0027m a big fan of. And I\u0027ve read a lot of Bob Marley books. There are a ton of Bob Marley books, and I\u0027ve read most of them, and this one is by far the best one I have ever read. It\u0027s excellent. Roger Steffens has about 40 years worth of interviews with all of the people around Bob, his family members, his band members, former band members, business associates, lovers, children, and he\u0027s assembled this book that takes us through Bob\u0027s very early years, right up until his death at 36 from melanoma. And it is just really interesting because it\u0027s the only book that I\u0027ve read about Bob that paints him as a real complex, three-dimensional individual. A lot of times when there\u0027s a figure who is a really big, important figure for a lot of people ... In many parts of the world, Bob Marley is considered like a prophet. He\u0027s considered a saint. He\u0027s above human. And a lot of the books about him sort of take that stance where his life is viewed through the lens of somebody who is destined for immortality. This book really presents him as a real human being, a man with problems and joys and sadness and setbacks and successes. It\u0027s just phenomenal. The best part about it, of course, is hearing all of the voices of his friends and family talk about him and all of his complexity. So I could definitely recommend it to anybody who is a lover of reggae music or has read Bob Marley books or is just interested in hearing more about his life because he was such a big figure in music. And even if you\u0027re jaded, because I\u0027m jaded, like I said, I\u0027ve read all these books, I did not need another one in my life until this one came along, and then I realized that this is the only one that you really need to read. So, So Much Things to Say, by Roger Steffens. That\u0027s my recommendation.\nLauren Goode: Awesome. Thanks Mike.\nMichael Calore: Sure. Always happy to squeeze in these obscure musical references about some of the best-selling artists in history for you.\nLauren Goode: That\u0027s not obscure though. I know last week, was it last week or the week before, I said something about an obscure artist and you said, \"She\u0027s not obscure.\" Bob Marley is not obscure.Michael Calore: Right. What\u0027s your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is White Lotus, season 2 on HBO Max.\nMichael Calore: Never heard of it.\nLauren Goode: You\u0027ve never ... Really?\nMichael Calore: No, I\u0027m kidding.\nLauren Goode: I was going to say, we\u0027ve got to get you up to speed. I have not watched the whole season yet. HBO is trickling them out week by week, so you can\u0027t really binge-watch it unless you wait several weeks to watch it all at once. I have watched five episodes, because that\u0027s what was available to the press when HBO handed out their digital screeners. There are only two that are available to broader audiences right now, but it\u0027s great. It\u0027s brilliant. It\u0027s created by Mike White. It revolves around a murder. Again, the very first episode you learn that multiple someones have been murdered, and you sort of just see a body floating by, but it\u0027s hard to tell who it is, and so then all of these characters are introduced. And White Lotus is the name of a resort chain. Last season was in Hawaii. This season is in Sicily, so a bunch of incredibly wealthy people are at the White Lotus Resort again. And it\u0027s an ensemble cast. It\u0027s like a handful of different couples, and they don\u0027t all know each other, but then they sort of interact in different ways throughout the season. And yeah, I would say this so far, this season doesn\u0027t feel quite as masterful as the first one. I think the first one was new and the concept was great. The writing was great. You sort of felt very invested in characters, whether they were the resort guests or people who actually worked at the resort, but the second season does maintain the element of escapism. That\u0027s makes it really fun to watch, and it\u0027s kind of like a soap opera, and there\u0027s all this sexual tension and total weirdness and this underlying darkness that you\u0027re just waiting to rear its ugly head. And I\u0027m really enjoying it so far. I can\u0027t wait to watch the final two episodes.\nMichael Calore: You\u0027ll have to live toot them.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I will indeed have to live-toot them or boost others who are live-tooting about it. Are we going to start doing that for live events? Are we going to go cover a big event and be like, \"Are we doing a live toot?\"\nMichael Calore: I look forward to all of your toots, live or not, about the finale of White Lotus season 2. I should be caught up by then.\nLauren Goode: I look forward to your toots about Swedish psych pop. And Andrew, thanks again for joining us.\nAndrew Couts: Thanks so much for having me.\nLauren Goode: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find most of us on Mastodon and all of us on Twitter, because we\u0027re still there. Just check the show notes. We\u0027ll put our handles in. I guess we should probably start putting our Mastodon handles in.\nMichael Calore: We absolutely should.\nLauren Goode: Why not? Our producer is the excellent Boone Ashworth, who\u0027s sitting here wearing a wooly mammoth costume in the studio.\nMichael Calore: It\u0027s a Mastodon costume.\nLauren Goode: Oh, all right. We\u0027ll be back next week. Thanks for listening.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","TWITTER","SOCIAL MEDIA"],"author":"BY WIRED STAFF","creation_date":"2022-11-10"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-great-crypto-cop-brain-drain/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Hunting down crypto criminals is a dying art as law enforcement officers jump in-house.","title":"The Great Crypto-Cop Brain Drain","detailed_content":"IN THE COURSE of a decade as a special agent with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Tigran Gambaryan⁩ has seen them all.

Instead, years after it was torn offline, it\u0027s proven to be the IRS’s gift that keeps on giving.\nOn Monday, the US Department of Justice announced that a Georgia man named James Zhong has pleaded guilty to wire fraud nine years after stealing more than 50,000 bitcoins from the Silk Road. As part of his plea agreement, Zhong has forfeited that massive stash of bitcoins to the DOJ—a sum that, at the time of the coins\u0027 seizure in late 2021, would have been the biggest-ever Justice Department seizure not only of cryptocurrency but of currency of any kind. The bitcoins were ultimately found stored on what’s described in court records as a “single-board computer” hidden in a popcorn can, along with more than $600,000 in cash and precious metals, all held in a safe under the floorboards of a bathroom closet in Zhong’s home.\nThe newly revealed case represents yet another notch in the belt for IRS Criminal Investigations, or IRS-CI, which over the past several years has used—very often in partnership with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis—cryptocurrency tracing techniques that have led to record-breaking troves of ill-gotten bitcoins and to the alleged hackers and money launderers who amassed them. In fact, Zhong is the second Silk Road hacker to turn over a billion-dollar cache of coins to the IRS-CI, after another unnamed individual agreed the previous year to forfeit nearly 70,000 bitcoins he\u0027d stolen from the drug market—a record-breaking, even larger collection of coins that was worth $1 billion at Bitcoin\u0027s lower exchange rate at the time. Both those records were again broken earlier this year by IRS-CI\u0027s case against two alleged money launderers in New York accused of pocketing $4.5 billion in cryptocurrency stolen from the Bitfinex exchange.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\n\"Thanks to state-of-the-art cryptocurrency tracing and good old-fashioned police work, law enforcement located and recovered this impressive cache of crime proceeds,\" wrote US Attorney Damian Williams, a prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, in a statement about the latest indictment and 10-figure seizure. \"This case shows that we won’t stop following the money, no matter how expertly hidden, even to a circuit board in the bottom of a popcorn tin.”\nThe hidden safe where investigators found a popcorn tin containing a storage device with Zhong’s $3.36 billion in Bitcoin.\nPHOTOGRAPH: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEAccording to an IRS-CI affidavit detailing Zhong\u0027s theft of the 50,000-plus bitcoins from the Silk Road, he appears to have found a vulnerability in that dark-web market that in 2012 allowed him to somehow pull more coins out of accounts he created there than he had deposited. The affidavit describes how he registered a succession of accounts on the site with names like \"thetormentor\" and \"dubba,\" deposited a sum of coins into the Bitcoin wallets for each account, and then made repeated withdrawals of the entire sums held there within a single second to multiply his money several times over. This apparently exploited a bug in the Silk Road that allowed those rapid-fire withdrawals without first confirming that the requested money still existed in a user\u0027s account. \"In this fashion, [Zhong], using each of the fraud accounts, moved at least approximately 50,000 Bitcoin out of Silk Road in just a few days,\" reads the affidavit, which was signed by IRS-CI special agent Trevor McAleenan.\nOver the nine years that followed, Zhong appears to have left that massive windfall almost entirely unspent—perhaps for fear that cashing it out into traditional currency would attract the attention of law enforcement. But even that epic restraint appears to have been in vain, as IRS-CI investigators nonetheless traced Zhong\u0027s coins to his accounts on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange, which revealed his identity. Zhong\u0027s case closely mirrors the story of the earlier Silk Road hacker, referred to in court documents only as Individual X, who similarly exploited a vulnerability in the Silk Road to take nearly 70,000 bitcoins from the site and hold them for more than seven years. But, perhaps due to the vagaries of negotiations over massive cryptocurrency fortunes, no charges against Individual X have been publicly revealed. Zhong, by contrast, now faces a wire fraud conviction that carries as much as 20 years in prison.\nThe Silk Road was torn down by a massive law enforcement operation in late 2013, leading to the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the site\u0027s creator, who was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to pay $183 million in restitution. In yet another bizarre twist, however, a portion of the seized 70,000 bitcoins taken from the Silk Road by Individual X were applied toward Ulbricht\u0027s debt, paying it off in full in exchange for his agreement not to lay any claim to the remaining money.\nUsing bitcoins stolen from the Silk Road to pay off the restitution of that site\u0027s creator may seem like a strange turn of events. But in an era when IRS-CI cryptocurrency seizures regularly pours billions of dollars into the US Treasury, there seems to be plenty to go around.","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRIME","SILK ROAD","DARK WEB","CRYPTOCURRENCY"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2022-11-07"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/how-the-uks-south-west-became-a-deep-tech-powerhouse-hsbc-uk/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"The region is called ‘Silicon Gorge’ for good reason – and that reputation didn’t emerge by chance…","title":"How The UK’s South West Became A ‘Deep Tech’ Powerhouse","detailed_content":"WHEN A SILICON Valley giant expanded to the UK forty years ago, it sparked a quiet revolution. It chose Bristol for its home-from-home, and in the coming decades, a huge influx of tech companies decided to follow suit. So much so that the Bristol-Swindon-Gloucester triangle acquired a new moniker: ‘Silicon Gorge.\u0027\nIt all started in 1972, when the top team at Fairchild Semiconductor International – a San Jose-based microchip pioneer whose founders later created Intel – found themselves attracted to Bristol for its reputation as a place of innovation. Not microchip innovation, admittedly, but aeronautical innovation – an industry that stretched back to 1910. There was a certain poetry at play: the organisation to which Fairchild Semiconductor belonged had started life as Fairchild Aircraft.\nIn 1978, as a direct result of Fairchild’s move to the city, the pioneering silicon chip developer Inmos launched in Bristol. It went on to attract over £200m of investment from the UK government over the following six years, and shone a light on the region as a serious, up-and-coming tech player. Today, the South West’s tech scene is in rude health – for “deep tech” in particular. Take XMOS, a semiconductor company specialising in intelligent processor solutions for the Internet of Things. “Inmos was to Bristol what Intel was to Silicon Valley,” reflects XMOS’ chief executive, Mark Lippett. “The creation of that company sparked a long running ecosystem that now feeds off itself. It is always looking ahead and moving forward.”\nAs defined by Boston Consulting Group, deep tech focuses on “large and fundamental issues,” that often tackle scientific or engineering challenges requiring lengthy periods of research and development plus large sums of capital. Chip design is archetypal “deep tech” because of the huge impact these products have on our everyday lives. But the sector is far broader than that. It spans advanced materials and manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, blockchain, robotics and electronics.\nThe tech credentials of Bristol and the surrounding region are clear from the participants in WIRED’s Trailblazer programme. In partnership with HSBC UK, this initiative focuses on medium-sized companies making an impact across the globe. And it’s no surprise that tech-driven firms are well represented. Alongside XMOS, you’ll find Rovco, for example, which provides underwater surveying for science and industry, and Immersive Labs, which trains organisations to take on cybersecurity threats.\nCentral to the South West’s innovation scene are the universities that feed it and the hubs and incubators that sustain it. In many cases the two are intrinsically linked. Science Creates, for example, is a deep tech incubator partnered with the University of Bristol. With a physical footprint of 45,000 sq ft, it supports more than 100 companies that collectively raised £18.4m in 2021 alone. Or take SETsquared, a start-up accelerator run collectively by the universities of Bristol, Bath, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey which has supported over 4,000 entrepreneurs. TechCrunch reports that since 2002 it has raised a funding total of £1.8bn.\nFive of WIRED’s Trailblazers – Rovco, XMOS, aerospace company Space Forge, touchless tech pioneer Ultraleap and data intelligence firm RipJar – were founded by University of Bristol and Bath alumni. XMOS’ Mark Lippett sees this as an important trend. “The deep tech scene fuelled by the universities here has become a catalyst for business growth,” he says. “There is a legacy of interesting and successful companies set up by alumni from local universities. This, among other things, means that people want to stick around the area after they have finished their degrees, resulting in a lot of talent retention and recycling.”\nLippett also highlights the city’s other major talent draw: its parallel reputation as a creative hub. “There is so much untapped potential at the intersection of creativity and science here,” he says. “Bringing some of the region’s creativity into the tech side of things and vice versa will result in a cross-fertilisation of ideas and an opportunity to think more creatively when it comes to using and applying technology.”\nIndeed, Bristol and the South West is an epicentre of creativity. As HSBC UK’s Deputy Regional Director for the South, Matt Wesley, points out: ‘‘Beyond its entrenched artistic spirit – famously it’s the region that produced Massive Attack and Banksy – it is the chosen location for some of the best-known creative brands and businesses in the UK. This makes it a hugely exciting region to find some of the UK’s most pioneering firms.’’\nThis creative legacy stems in large part from the BBC’s Natural History Unit having based itself in Bristol since its formation in 1957. It kickstarted a surge of digital, branding and design enterprises putting down roots in the region. One of the best known is Aardman, the award-winning animation studio famed for hit films, series, advertising, and now games and interactive entertainment. Its roster includes much-loved productions such as Chicken Run, Wallace \u0026 Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and Morph, all made using clay models and stop-motion. The studio continues to innovate with digital projects such as its first in-house CGI series, Lloyd of the Flies, and The Grand Getaway; a new Wallace \u0026 Gromit VR adventure for Meta Quest launching in 2023. “There is a great culture here of tapping into local ideas and innovation,” says Aardman managing director, Sean Clarke. “But when you talk to founders in this space about Bristol, there are additional factors attracting them here. It has long been an appealing location for the film and TV community thanks to the BBC’s Natural History Unit. And the transport links are very good. We are close to London and Bristol airport connects us to Europe. We are also seeing a lot of artistic people relocating to areas like Bristol from London to get more bang for their buck, so it is an increasingly good location in terms of access to a creative and diverse workforce. And as a values-led organisation, attracting and nurturing talent from all backgrounds is incredibly important to us.”\nThe maturation of Bristol’s creative sector, bolstered by the deep tech scene it has been cultivating for the past four decades, has furnished the city with a bright outlook. It’s now the fifth-fastest growing tech city in the UK according to the Digital Economy Council’s Levelling Up Power Tech League report. A 2021 government forecast named three companies in the area that are likely to achieve unicorn valuations. One of them was the ecommerce fulfilment business Huboo, which says that it only sees the region going from strength to strength. “This area has always been a success story, but until recently certain industries tended to dominate,” says its CEO Martin Bysh. “Now, it has a diverse tech scene that spans multiple sectors and has an incredible sense of momentum.

Desjardins decided to pay him a visit.\nCazes, he found, lived in an unremarkable, midsize house in a gated community in the Thai capital, but the baby-faced Canadian in his early twenties seemed to be doing well for himself. He had invested early in Bitcoin, he told Desjardins, and it had paid off.\nHis biggest financial problem seemed to be that he now had more cash than he could deal with. He alluded to having sold bitcoins to Russian mafia contacts in Bangkok. A foreigner depositing the resulting voluminous bundles of Thai baht at a bank would raise red flags with local regulators, he worried. So instead he had piles of bills accumulating around his home, even hidden in recesses in the walls.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n “There was money everywhere,” Desjardins remembers. “You open a drawer, and you find money.”\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nDespite Cazes\u0027 liquidity issues and his somewhat alarming mention of the Russian mob, Desjardins couldn\u0027t see any evidence that his strange new acquaintance was involved in anything overtly criminal. He didn\u0027t use any drugs; he seemed to barely drink beer. Cazes was friendly and intelligent, if socially strange and emotionally “very cold,” like someone going through the motions of human interaction rather than doing so naturally. “It was all logic,” Desjardins says, “ones and zeros.” He did note that his new friend, while otherwise generous and good-natured, had ideas about women and sex that struck him as very conservative, bordering on misogynistic.\nDuring that first visit, the two men discussed Desjardins\u0027 idea for a new ecommerce website. Cazes appeared interested, and Desjardins suggested they work on it together.\nBack in Quebec around Christmas of that year, Cazes met with Desjardins again, this time to hear a full business pitch. After no more than 15 minutes of discussion, Cazes was in. He impressed Desjardins by spending $150,000 without hesitation on a web domain for their business, not even bothering to haggle with the seller.In another pleasant surprise, Cazes also paid a six-figure legal bill that Desjardins had racked up in a dispute with another business. He turned out to be a coding savant too; Desjardins had planned to hire a team of coders, but Cazes quickly did most of the initial programming for their fledgling site single-handedly.\nAs they worked to get their business off the ground, Desjardins could see that Cazes was richer than he had first estimated. Desjardins learned that his partner was in the process of buying a villa in Cyprus and making some sort of real estate investment in Antigua. When Desjardins next visited Bangkok, Cazes picked him up at the airport in a dark gray Lamborghini Aventador.\nDesjardins pointed out that there was nowhere in the supercar to fit his large suitcase. Cazes told him to get in anyway and gamely struggled with the luggage until it fit onto his guest\u0027s lap. Desjardins remembers seeing the suitcase scratch parts of the Lamborghini\u0027s interior, but Cazes didn\u0027t seem to care. In fact, he didn\u0027t seem to have much emotional connection to the car at all; he didn\u0027t even know how to use its radio. Desjardins thought Cazes appeared to own it out of a sense that it was the socially correct way to display his wealth.\nAs they left the airport, Cazes asked Desjardins whether he\u0027d ever been in a Lamborghini before. He responded that he had not. Within seconds, Desjardins was flattened against the Aventador\u0027s passenger seat as his eccentric friend rocketed them down the Bangkok highway at more than 150 miles per hour.\nIN LATE NOVEMBER 2016, just before Thanksgiving, Grant Rabenn was wrapping up his caseload in his office and preparing for the holiday when he got a call from Miller. “Hey, Grant,” Miller said. “I think I’ve got something big that we should talk about.”\nThey met at the Starbucks a block from Fresno\u0027s courthouse. Miller explained what his tipster had told him: In AlphaBay\u0027s earliest days online, long before it gained its hundreds of thousands of users or came under the microscope of law enforcement, the market\u0027s creator had made a critical, almost laughable security mistake. Everyone who registered on the site\u0027s forums at the time had received a welcome email, sent via the site\u0027s Tor-protected server. But due to a misconfiguration in the server\u0027s setup, the message\u0027s metadata plainly revealed the email address of the person who sent it—Pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com—along with the IP address of the server, which placed it in the Netherlands.\nThe error had quickly been fixed, but only after the tipster had registered and received the welcome email. The source had kept it archived for two years as AlphaBay grew into the biggest dark-web market in history.\nAnd now they had given it to Miller. It seemed that even the figure Rabenn once thought of as “the Michael Jordan of the dark web” was capable of elementary security errors—with permanent consequences.\nRabenn received Miller\u0027s revelation coolly. He\u0027d heard before from overexcited agents whose incredible leads led to dead ends or hoaxes. Surely, he thought, if his little team in Fresno had these clues, someone else in the US government must be miles ahead of them. But they nonetheless decided to drop everything and follow the tip.There was, in fact, more to the source\u0027s lead, all of which could be corroborated with a few Google searches. The Pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com address also appeared on a French-language social media site, Skyrock.com. There, someone named “Alex” had posted photos of himself from 2008 and 2009, dressed in baggy shirts covered in images of dollar bills and jewels and wearing crisp new baseball caps with a silver pendant hanging from his neck. In one picture he\u0027d written his hip hop handle, “RAG MIND,” at the top of the image in the style of a debut rap album. The words on his shirt read “HUSTLE KING.”\nA dating profile the man had posted to the site identified his hometown, Trois-Rivières in the French-Canadian province of Quebec, and his age at the time, 17. So the “91” in his email address was his birth year. If this was indeed AlphaBay\u0027s founder, he would have been 23 at the time of the market\u0027s creation.\nNothing about this young French-Canadian hip hop wannabe matched Rabenn and Miller\u0027s sense of the kingpin known as Alpha02. Had all of the allusions to Russia and Russian-language snippets been a ruse? Based on the IP address included in the tipster\u0027s email, the site\u0027s forums, at least, seemed to be based in Western Europe.\nTo Miller and Rabenn, the theory that “Alex” was Alpha02 seemed outlandish at first. But the deeper they looked, the more plausible it became. The young Quebecer had used his Pimp_alex_91 email address years earlier on a French-language technology forum called Comment Ça Marche—“How It Works.” He had signed his messages with his full name: Alexandre Cazes.\nSearching for that name, the investigators came upon a more recent LinkedIn profile for a decidedly more adult Alex, sans hip hop outfit, advertising himself as a web programmer and the founder of a Quebec-based hosting and web design company called EBX Technologies. His photo showed an unremarkable-looking businessman in a gray suit and white shirt with no tie. He had a round face with a cleft chin, slightly thinning hair in the front, and an innocent openness to his expression.\nCazes listed his location as Quebec, Canada, but they could see from his social media connections that he seemed to actually be based in Thailand. Further digging on social media revealed Facebook accounts for Cazes\u0027 fiancée, a pretty Thai woman named Sunisa Thapsuwan. A telling photo on a relative\u0027s profile showed Cazes in a suit and sunglasses, standing next to a dark gray Lamborghini Aventador.\nDigging deeper still, they found the most telling clues of all. On Comment Ça Marche and another programming forum called Dream in Code were older profiles for Cazes that had been deleted, but they were preserved on the Internet Archive. Years earlier, it seemed, he had written on those forums under another username: Alpha02.\nWITHIN DAYS, RABENN and Miller knew their lead was solid. They also knew the case was too big for them to take on alone. They decided to bring their findings to the FBI field office in Sacramento, a much larger outpost just a few hours\u0027 drive north with significantly more cybercrime expertise and resources than their small Fresno office. It turned out that the agents in Sacramento had been tracking AlphaBay from its inception. Nonetheless, Miller\u0027s tip was new information to them.Rabenn brought on the office\u0027s assistant US attorney, Paul Hemesath, as an investigative partner. The two had been friendly for years; Hemesath, an older and more deliberate prosecutor, had the air of a college professor, and he balanced out Rabenn\u0027s aggressive run-and-gun approach. Hemesath in turn asked for help from the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section at Justice Department headquarters—the office in Washington, DC, where a small army of cybercrime-focused agents and computer forensics analysts was based.\nAs they assembled their team, Miller and Rabenn began the delicate process of “deconfliction,” figuring out whether other agencies and task forces around the country had their own open cases on Alpha02. Again and again, Rabenn heard that another team in another city was investigating AlphaBay but had made no real headway. None appeared to recognize the name Alexandre Cazes.\nAgainst all odds, Rabenn began to realize, his little office in the Central Valley was perhaps closer than anyone in the world to cracking the dark web\u0027s deepest mystery. Soon they would find themselves at the vanguard of its biggest global manhunt.\nCHAPTER 4\nTHAILAND\nIF CAZES HAD moved halfway around the world to Bangkok to run AlphaBay beyond the reach of Western law enforcement, he\u0027d chosen, by some measures, exactly the wrong destination.\nFor more than half a century, the US government has had an enormous presence in Thailand. Even before the DEA was founded in 1973, a US agency called the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs had stationed a field office in Bangkok. American agents had long been sent there to disrupt the flow of so-called China White heroin from the opium-growing Golden Triangle region that covers parts of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. In the late 1950s that triangle produced half of the world\u0027s heroin supply and fed an epidemic of addicted US soldiers in Vietnam in the \u002760s and \u002770s—a problem that made quashing the Thai drug trade one of the DEA\u0027s earliest and highest priorities. Fifty years later, Bangkok remains one of the largest and most active DEA offices in the world, the regional headquarters for the entire East Asia operations of the US law enforcement agency that has more overseas agents than any other.For Jen Sanchez, it was also a plum assignment: beautiful weather, low cost of living, incredible food, and not particularly dangerous—relative to other DEA hot spots, anyway.\nSanchez, a 26-year veteran of the DEA in her mid-fifties with white hair cut to her shoulders and a zero-bullshit, profanity-laden approach to conversation, felt she\u0027d earned her coveted Bangkok job. She\u0027d spent years in Mexico City investigating money laundering followed by a stint in Texas, where her work led to the arrest of three Mexican governors for taking bribes from the Zetas drug cartel and embezzling from their own state governments. In that case, dubbed Operation Politico Junction, she\u0027d tracked the governors\u0027 dirty money into the businesses they\u0027d bought to launder it, along with mansions, luxury cars, and private aircraft. In total, Sanchez had signed affidavits for seized assets worth more than $90 million. She\u0027d come to relish the righteous thrill of bankrupting criminals who had spent their lives amassing ill-gotten wealth. And since much of that money ended up in DEA coffers, it hadn\u0027t exactly hurt her career, either. As she modestly put it, “I paid for myself.”\nBy December 2016, Sanchez had been in Thailand for nine months, mostly helping to track the financing for violent Islamic movements in the country\u0027s south. Then one day, at the Bangkok DEA office—situated in the US embassy, a white stone building with a canal surrounding its foundation and a grass lawn where 6-foot-long monitor lizards emerged from the foliage in the evening—her boss told her they had a visitor: a DEA official who was set to give them a presentation on virtual currency.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay companion newsletter. \nSanchez didn\u0027t know anything about virtual currency. Nor, with just a few years left until retirement, did she particularly care to learn about it. But she listened politely throughout the presentation. Only at the end of the session did the visiting agent truly get her attention: He mentioned, almost in passing, that the DEA had recently found a lead on the administrator of the world\u0027s biggest dark-web market and that he seemed to be right there in Thailand.\nSanchez had heard of Silk Road. She asked whether this site was as big as that legendary black market. The agent responded that it was at least three or four times the size of Silk Road, and growing. “Holy shit,” Sanchez thought to herself. The biggest dark-web kingpin in history was in her backyard? The scale of the money laundering alone would be enormous.\n“He\u0027s going to have stuff,” she remembers thinking. And she wanted to be the one to track down those assets and seize them.\nAnother group of agents in Bangkok had been assigned to handle the AlphaBay case. Sanchez\u0027s own supervisor, to her constant frustration, seemed more interested in busting small-time dealers on the tourist beaches of Pattaya than in big-game, long-term investigations. But Sanchez was not about to be left out of what she suspected might be one of the largest seizures of cash and property—virtual or otherwise—in the history of the DEA in Thailand. As soon as the presentation was over and the visiting agent left, Sanchez walked into her boss\u0027s office, pointed a finger at him, and told him she wanted AlphaBay.\nSANCHEZ GOT HER wish. She soon found herself on a series of sometimes bewildering conference calls among all the different agencies now hunting Cazes across a dozen time zones. Those calls included Rabenn, Miller, Hemesath, and the Sacramento FBI team, who laid out AlphaBay\u0027s basic mechanics and use of cryptocurrency.As Sanchez began to get a sense of the full extent of the massive commerce in hard drugs that AlphaBay now facilitated on a daily basis, she became incensed. The US opioid crisis was, by that time, in full swing; 42,000 Americans had died of opiate overdoses in 2016, more than in any year on record. That surge was due in part to an influx of fentanyl, the opium derivative as much as 100 times stronger than morphine. And here this 25-year-old French-Canadian was running a massive open-air heroin and fentanyl bazaar in public view? She was haunted by the thought that every day AlphaBay was left online, anyone, even children, could order fentanyl from the site, receive it in the mail, and die of an overdose in a matter of hours. \nIn one call with Miller in Fresno, she swore they would have AlphaBay offline and Cazes behind bars in less than six months. “I\u0027m going to take his shit, and he is going to go to jail, and we\u0027re going to get him in Florence supermax,” she remembers telling Miller, referencing the prison where Ross Ulbricht was then serving his life sentence. “I want this kid gone.”\nNow that Sanchez had joined the AlphaBay investigation, she was working under a new boss in Bangkok: a 47-year-old, Puerto Rico–born DEA agent named Wilfredo Guzman. Guzman had started his career hunting drug-laden speedboats off the coast of Puerto Rico and had risen through the agency\u0027s ranks following a series of massive Caribbean and South American cases. Now, as a supervisor in the Bangkok office, he prioritized, above all else, maintaining a hand-in-glove relationship with the Thai police\u0027s DEA equivalent, known as the Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB). Doing so required near-constant late-night business dinners of painfully spicy food, drunken banquets, and karaoke outings, belting out John Denver lyrics onstage with high-ranking Bangkok cops.\nThe Royal Thai Police have a far-from-sterling record when it comes to drug trafficking and corruption. For some in the agency, shakedowns of petty drug dealers are understood to be a perk of the job. One RTP official named Thitisan Utthanaphon had earned the nickname Joe Ferrari for his collection of sports cars of mysterious provenance. He would later be caught in a leaked video suffocating a suspected meth dealer to death alongside six fellow cops.\nSo when Robert Miller asked Guzman in the agency\u0027s Bangkok office for help in hunting Cazes, Guzman brought it to his most trusted contact at the NSB, Colonel Pisal Erb-Arb, who led the agency\u0027s Bangkok Intelligence Center. Pisal was a spry, fatherly officer in his mid-fifties who frequently used his unassuming look as a balding middle-aged dad to take on undercover assignments. He had assembled a small team known for its squeaky-clean, by-the-book investigative work, as well as for Pisal\u0027s rare practice of advancing female agents.\nAlmost immediately, Guzman, Pisal, and the NSB team got to work tracking down their new target. Starting with just Cazes\u0027 name and a telephone number, they began to map out his properties: one home in a quiet gated community that he visited intermittently—what they came to call his “bachelor pad” or “safe house”—and another in his wife\u0027s name in a gated neighborhood on the other side of town, where he seemed to work and sleep. He had bought and was remodeling a third home, a $3 million mansion, farther on the outskirts of Bangkok.Soon the investigators were shadowing Cazes\u0027 every move around the city. The Thais were particularly fascinated to discover his Lamborghini, a supercar that cost nearly $1 million, as well as his Porsche Panamera and BMW motorcycle, all of which he drove at speeds well above 100 miles an hour whenever Bangkok traffic allowed.\nFollowing Cazes proved to be a moderate challenge: He frequently zoomed away from the agents tailing his sports cars on stretches of unbroken highway or lost them while snaking between trucks and tuk-tuks on his motorcycle. Pisal used a bit of personal tradecraft to plant a GPS tracker on Cazes\u0027 Porsche, posing as a drunk and collapsing next to the car in a parking garage, then affixing the device to its undercarriage. The police tried attaching a similar tracking beacon to the Lamborghini but found that the car\u0027s chassis rode so low to the ground that their gadget wouldn\u0027t fit. They resorted to tracking Cazes\u0027 iPhone instead, triangulating its position from cellular towers.\nAs Pisal\u0027s team began to assemble a detailed picture of Cazes\u0027 daily life, they were struck by how aboveboard it all seemed. He was a “homebody,” as one agent put it, spending entire days without stepping outside. When he did leave his home during the day, he would go to the bank or his Thai language classes downtown, or take his wife out to restaurants or the mall. He lived, as Pisal put it using an English phrase commonly adopted by Thais, a “chill-chill” life of leisure.\nCould their too-good-to-be-true tip have been some sort of elaborate misdirection? Was someone just trying to frame Cazes, to use him as a patsy?\nIt soon became apparent to Guzman and the Thai police that Cazes did have one very significant secret in his nondigital life: He was a womanizer. He frequently ventured out in the evenings to pick up dates—from a 7-Eleven, from the mall, from his language class—and take them to his bachelor pad, or else to love motels. These encounters were businesslike and brief. By the end of the night, Cazes would be back at home with his wife.\nSo-called sexpats—foreigners using their wealth to live out polyamorous fantasies—were common in Thailand. And as scandalous as Cazes\u0027 affairs might have been, there was no law against philandering. Still, the Thais needed little convincing that Cazes must be some form of crime boss. At one point the surveillance team trailed him to a restaurant called Sirocco on the roof of Bangkok\u0027s Lebua hotel; 63 floors up, it claimed to offer the highest alfresco dining in the world, with two Michelin stars and $2,400 bottles of wine on the menu.\nWhen Cazes and a group of friends left the restaurant, the cops entered and spoke to Sirocco\u0027s management, demanding the entire day\u0027s receipts to obscure whose bill they were hunting for. Including wine and lavish tips, they found that Cazes had spent no less than 1.3 million baht—nearly $40,000—in a single meal for his entourage, an amount that flabbergasted even the agents accustomed to tracking high-rolling drug kingpins.\nDrug lords who never touched narcotics themselves or directly carried out crimes were nothing new to the NSB agents. They were used to the notion that the cleaner a suspect\u0027s hands were, the more senior the position they likely held in a drug trafficking syndicate. But those high-ranking bosses often met with associates who were connected to hands-on crimes or were at least a step or two removed from them.Cazes\u0027 criminality, by contrast, seemed to be channeled entirely through the opaque aperture of the dark web, safely behind the veil of Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain. In the physical world, his hands were cleaner than those of any kingpin they\u0027d ever encountered.\nAt times, this perfect veneer led even the US investigators to doubt themselves. Sure, Cazes seemed to have slipped up once, years ago, when he left that Pimp_alex hotmail address in the metadata of a welcome email. But as their burgeoning investigative team followed up on that initial lead, Rabenn and Hemesath periodically asked each other whether they truly had the right guy. Could their too-good-to-be-true tip have been some sort of elaborate misdirection? Could someone have purposefully leaked the address—and even chosen the handle Alpha02—as a way to frame this Cazes, to use him as a patsy? “The nightmare scenario would be that the source was setting us up,” Rabenn remembers thinking.\nThe only way to know for sure, they would soon find, lay in a different approach—one that only a few years earlier would have seemed impossible. By early 2017, there was a new, growing class of investigators who saw Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain as something other than an impenetrable veil. They had come to realize that, far from a mysterious, anonymous currency, Bitcoin was, in fact, an almost entirely traceable financial system. And it was those tracers who would offer the next breakthrough in the race to take down Alpha02.\nCHAPTER 5\nTUNAFISH\nBY LATE 2016, a pair of FBI analysts, both based in Washington, DC, had gained a reputation as perhaps the very best team of cryptocurrency tracers in the US government. (Per their request, they are referred to here by only their first names, Ali and Erin.) The two shared a focus on digital money laundering, a fascination with cryptocurrency, and a yearslong friendship. Despite working for different investigative groups in different offices, they had come to form a two-person team of their own, practically mind-melding into two lobes of a single Bitcoin-obsessed brain. And they operated almost entirely under the radar, only ever producing leads that they quietly handed off to other investigators, clues that appeared in no criminal affidavits or courtroom evidence.\nAs it happened, on a winter morning just weeks after Robert Miller had received his Alpha02 tip—and before almost anyone else in the US government knew about it—Ali had come to Erin with an idea. She\u0027d left the FBI satellite office where she worked, in a grim Beltway office park in Chantilly, Virginia, and driven for half an hour through DC traffic to ambush Erin at her desk at FBI headquarters. Ali, the more ebullient and ambitious of the two, wanted Erin to push aside all their other work so they could try something no one had ever pulled off before: tracking down a dark-web administrator—perhaps even the admin of AlphaBay—through the techniques of blockchain analysis alone.Before Erin had time to protest, Ali squeezed a chair into Erin\u0027s tiny cubicle and impatiently grabbed her mouse to start clicking through Bitcoin addresses on her computer screen.\nAli\u0027s ambition to expose a dark-web kingpin\u0027s finances had come to seem attainable only after years of advances in crypto-tracing techniques—the latest of which had AlphaBay specifically in their crosshairs. Ali and Erin were both fluent users by that point of Reactor, a piece of software made by a New York startup called Chainalysis. Together with a handful of other companies like it, Chainalysis had, since 2014, pioneered and automated a set of powerful new methods for tracing cryptocurrency. Those efforts had quietly flipped the criminal promise of Bitcoin on its head, rendering the blockchain into a branching series of breadcrumb trails that allowed cybercrime investigators to follow the money as never before.\nSome of these techniques were relatively straightforward. For instance, a crypto tracer using Reactor could sometimes follow bitcoins as they moved from address to address until they reached one that could be tied to an account at an exchange, where they were cashed out for traditional currency. Then Chainalysis\u0027 customers in law enforcement could simply subpoena the exchange for the account holder\u0027s identity, since US law required exchanges to collect this information on American users.\nChainalysis\u0027 more powerful contribution to bitcoin tracing had been a collection of “clustering” methods that allowed it to show when different Bitcoin addresses—dozens to millions of them—belonged to a single person or organization. If Reactor showed that coins from two or more addresses were spent in a single “multi-input” transaction, for example, that meant one entity must have control of all those addresses. This trick had made Silk Road users\u0027 money relatively easy to track: Just send a few test transactions to any Silk Road account, and the market\u0027s wallet system would soon bundle up your coins with others in multi-input transactions, leading to a cluster of other Silk Road addresses—like a briefcase full of bills with a homing device inside, brought back to a criminal\u0027s hideout.\nBut Chainalysis had found that the same method didn\u0027t work on AlphaBay, which seemed to carefully avoid pooling users\u0027 payments, and kept them instead in many small, disconnected addresses. Indeed, by April 2016, AlphaBay had begun advertising to users that it functioned as a bitcoin tumbler: Put money into an AlphaBay account, and it purportedly severed any link that could be used to follow it from where it entered the market to where it left. “No level of blockchain analysis can prove your coins come from AlphaBay because we use our own obfuscation technology,” read one 2016 post from AlphaBay\u0027s staff to users on the site. “You now have ironclad plausible deniability with your bitcoins.”\nThose claims, Chainalysis found, turned out to be largely true. Because AlphaBay never gathered coins into large, easily identifiable purses, it was nearly impossible to look at any given transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and tell whether it involved a trade on AlphaBay.That layer of obfuscation represented a serious problem for Chainalysis\u0027 many customers in law enforcement. And so for much of 2016, mapping all the addresses on the blockchain that were associated with AlphaBay users—the dark market’s “wallet”—had become the most difficult and pressing challenge Chainalysis had ever taken on. Month after month, Chainalysis\u0027 staff performed hundreds of test transactions with AlphaBay—never actually buying anything from the market, only moving money into and out of accounts—and watched the patterns those transactions formed on the blockchain, in hopes of finding clues that they could use to spot patterns elsewhere in the vast expanse of Bitcoin\u0027s accounting ledger.\nGradually, the company\u0027s researchers found distinct tells in the way AlphaBay moved its users\u0027 money. These clues came from the highly specific choices made by Alpha02 and whoever else was writing the code of AlphaBay\u0027s wallet. Chainalysis refused to divulge most of them, but cofounder Jonathan Levin offered an example. According to the system of incentives devised by the currency\u0027s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, a Bitcoin wallet has to pay a fee for each transaction; the greater the fee, the more likely the thousands of servers known as Bitcoin nodes—the backbone of the Bitcoin network—are to quickly rebroadcast the transaction so that the entire network agrees that the transaction occurred. Most wallets allow users to set their own fees along a sliding scale of speed versus cost. Dark-web markets, however, typically set their own fees. On AlphaBay, Chainalysis discovered, larger transactions required larger fees according to a distinct sliding scale. This represented a small tell—one of many, Levin says—that would allow them to spot transactions likely happening on AlphaBay and so produce a new set of addresses that would then, in turn, lead to others.\nIt was painstaking work. Every time AlphaBay rewrote the software for its wallet, the telltale patterns changed. Yet by the end of 2016, Chainalysis had labeled more than 2.5 million addresses as part of AlphaBay\u0027s wallet.\nFor Chainalysis\u0027 law enforcement customers, however, that breakthrough was just a starting point. The task that still lay ahead would be to follow the money from somewhere in that vast pile of numbers out to the bank account of a real human being. And from a cubicle in Washington, DC, that\u0027s exactly what Ali and Erin set out to do.\nON THAT WINTER day in 2016 when Ali decided to conscript Erin into her unprecedented scheme, she hurriedly explained to Erin a realization she\u0027d had. Dark-web markets, everyone knew by then, were notoriously vulnerable to “exit scams”: schemes in which an administrator suddenly shuts down a market and then absconds with all its users\u0027 money. Every time this happened, dark-web forums were flooded with laments and reminders that no one should store any more cryptocurrency on a market than they planned to spend immediately.\nBut there was one person, Ali figured, who would never have to worry about an exit scam when considering where to keep their crypto savings: the dark-web site\u0027s administrator himself. “Who would have the most faith to leave their money on the market?” Ali asked Erin. “Of course it would be the guy in charge.”So what if they simply searched for the black market addresses that had held the largest sums of bitcoins for the longest time? The biggest, most stationary piles of money might just belong to the bosses.\nErin admitted it was a good idea. But after identifying a few addresses to look at, she shooed Ali out of her office to get on with her other work. After all, no one had asked them to track down Alpha02; they had intelligence reports to write and more realistic targets to hunt.\nThe next day, however, Ali began calling Erin every few minutes with breathless updates. She had started with the address of the biggest sum of bitcoins that had sat unmoved for the longest time among all the wallet addresses tied to the AlphaBay cluster. And, spotting the point where that money had finally changed addresses, she\u0027d been able to track its movements from one hop to another, following its path in Reactor through the branching tendrils forking off from the market.\n“It\u0027s still going!” she\u0027d tell Erin excitedly on the phone as she followed it from one address to the next.\nSoon Erin, infected by Ali\u0027s enthusiasm, was digging through other unmoved piles of bitcoins that she now suspected might be an administrator\u0027s commissions. Talking constantly on the phone across the DC–Virginia border, they began to devote hours to their Alpha02 hunt, scanning through hundreds of AlphaBay addresses in Reactor.\nWhoever owned these piles of presumably criminal money had, at least in some cases, taken pains to hide their footprints on the blockchain. The funds would sometimes flow into clusters of addresses created by services known as mixers, advertised on dark-web sites with names like Helix and Bitcoin Fog. These bitcoin-laundering services offered to take in coins, pool them with other users\u0027 funds, and then return all the coins in the pool to their senders at new addresses. In theory this would cut the forensic link for any tracer, like a bank robber who slips into a movie theater, takes off his ski mask, and walks out with the crowd, evading the police on his tail.\nAli and Erin did sometimes hit dead ends in their work to trace Alpha02\u0027s profits. But in other cases, they were able to defeat his efforts at obfuscation. Neither of the two FBI analysts would reveal how they overcame Alpha02\u0027s use of mixers, but crypto tracers like those at Chainalysis offered hints.\nA mixer, Jonathan Levin explained, is only as good as its “anonymity set”—the crowd of users mixing their coins to render them untraceable. Despite whatever claims mixers made to their customers, examining their work on the blockchain revealed that many didn\u0027t actually offer an anonymity set large enough to truly flummox an investigator. The more money someone tried to launder, the harder it became to avoid those coins remaining recognizable when they reappeared on the mixer\u0027s other end.\nAny decent mixer splits large sums of coins into smaller, less conspicuous payments when returning the money to its owner. But with transaction fees for every payment, there\u0027s a limit to how much big sums of money will be broken up, Levin says.In truth, Chainalysis didn\u0027t need to offer its users proof of the path that money took on the blockchain, so much as probability. Grant Rabenn candidly explained that the bar for sending a subpoena to a cryptocurrency exchange for a user\u0027s identifying information was low enough that they could simply try multiple educated guesses.\nAll of this meant that, in spite of a criminal\u0027s best efforts, investigators were often left with suspicious outputs from mixers, ones that they could follow with enough likelihood—if not certainty—of staying on their target\u0027s trail. Even the crowded-movie-theater trick, it turns out, breaks down when the robber is carrying a large enough sack of loot and the cops are watching every exit.\nAS ALI AND Erin followed what they increasingly believed to be Alpha02\u0027s personal transactions, they gave nicknames to the most significant Bitcoin addresses they were scrutinizing, turning the strings of meaningless characters into pronounceable words. An address that started 1Lcyn4t would become, in their private language, “Lye sin fort.” One that began with the characters 3MboAt would be pronounced “Em boat.” The two analysts spent so much time examining and discussing these names that the addresses began to take on “personalities” in their minds. (“It’s not exactly healthy,” Erin said.)\nOf all of their named addresses, one loomed largest in the two analysts\u0027 conversations. They refused to reveal even its nickname for fear that someone might reverse engineer the actual address and learn their tricks. For the purposes of this story, let\u0027s call it “Tunafish.”\nTunafish lay at the end of a long string of hops Ali and Erin had followed out from one of the initial addresses that they\u0027d hypothesized might be Alpha02\u0027s. It held special significance, however: It connected directly to an exchange. For the first time, they realized with excitement, they had managed to trace what they suspected might be a collection of the AlphaBay admin\u0027s bitcoins all the way to a transaction in which Alpha02 had traded them for traditional currency. They knew it was at those cash-out points—the blockchain\u0027s connections to the brick-and-mortar world of finance—that they might be able to match the transactions to a real person.\nJust as they were on the verge of ferreting out a name behind all of Alpha02\u0027s transactions, Ali got wind of some news quietly floating among law enforcement agents across the country. As a longtime dark-web analyst, she\u0027d kept in close contact for years with the Sacramento FBI agent who had first opened a file on AlphaBay. So when the Sacramento office joined forces with Grant Rabenn\u0027s Fresno team, Ali was among the first people the agent called. He told her that they had finally matched a real person to Alpha02\u0027s online persona. He gave her the name of a certain French-Canadian living in Bangkok.\nInvestigators started to recognize Cazes\u0027 identifying tells. In some cases, his attempts to obscure his ownership of bitcoins became, themselves, a kind of fingerprint.\nThe Sacramento agent knew Ali was already busy tracing AlphaBay\u0027s blockchain tentacles. He asked her to join their growing investigative team. Ali returned to Erin\u0027s office at FBI headquarters, cornered her in the hallway, and insisted she join the team, too. “This is going to be a massive case,” Ali told her. “We need to do this together.” Erin said yes.\nNow they were hunting Alpha02 no longer as an obsessive hobby, but as part of an official investigation. Ali and Erin explained their Tunafish discovery to an assistant US attorney based in DC who had also joined the team, a seasoned cybercrime prosecutor named Louisa Marion. She, Rabenn, and Hemesath immediately filed a subpoena for the identifying records on the exchange where the Tunafish address had been cashed out.That legal request took weeks to bear fruit. Finally, one evening in the early weeks of January 2017, Ali was in the middle of a law school night class when she got a call from the Sacramento-based FBI agent with the news: The subpoena results had come back.\nThe agent told her the name on the exchange account tied to the Tunafish address. It was Alexandre Cazes.\nOVER THE NEXT months, Ali and Erin continued to trace more high-value addresses out of the AlphaBay cluster into one cryptocurrency exchange after another. They came to recognize what seemed to be Cazes\u0027 identifying tells, even in his bitcoin-laundering habits; in some cases, his attempts to obscure his ownership of the bitcoins became, themselves, a kind of fingerprint.\nIn total, the two analysts traced Cazes\u0027 commissions to a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges. The prosecutors then subpoenaed these one by one, finding accounts registered in both Cazes\u0027 and his wife\u0027s names. And as those results came in, a yearslong pattern emerged: Cazes would open an account with an exchange and attempt to use it to cash out a chunk of AlphaBay\u0027s profits. At some point—often within months of his cash-out transactions—the exchange would grow suspicious about the origin of these massive cryptocurrency trades and ask for more know-your-customer information from him.\nCazes would send a note explaining that he was merely an early investor in Bitcoin. In some cases the AlphaBay founder claimed to have bought thousands of coins from the defunct exchange Mt. Gox in 2011 or 2012—knowing it would be difficult to check the records, given that Mt. Gox had declared bankruptcy in 2014. In others, Cazes claimed to have bought them from a private seller at the exchange rate of a dollar each. “Since then, I’ve been pretty much juggling the coins like stocks, buying and selling, but never cashing out,” he wrote in one emailed explanation to an exchange.\nBy 2017, however, legitimate Bitcoin businesses had learned to be wary of these unverifiable stories. In most cases they closed or froze Cazes\u0027 account, forcing him to move onto another exchange. Ali and Erin, meanwhile, could see the true source of Cazes\u0027 wealth traced out in strand after strand of the blockchain\u0027s connections.\nFor years to come, the investigators involved in the AlphaBay case would debate whether their cryptocurrency tracing alone would have cracked the case even if they had never gotten the Pimp_alex_91 tip. Would the appearance of Cazes\u0027 name on those exchange accounts have been enough to put them onto his trail, or would they have treated it as just another vague lead that they were too busy to chase down?\nComing as it did, however, in the immediate wake of the tip sent to Miller about Alpha02, the two FBI analysts\u0027 blockchain work nailed to the wall a theory that would have otherwise hung by only a few threads. Every exchange subpoena and its results drew another line between Cazes and AlphaBay\u0027s fortune.\n“When we saw millions of dollars in crypto flowing to him from what appeared to be AlphaBay-associated wallets, I was fairly confident that we had the right person,” Rabenn says. “When you hit that point, you start gearing up to indict.”\nContinued in part 3: When investigators find Cazes’ online alter ego on a pickup artist forum, they also discover a new challenge to catching him red-handed—and hatch a plan for the most ambitious sting in dark-web history.\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday. \nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

A slight, 46-year-old agent of the Royal Thai Police with a short, boyish haircut, she wore a white polo shirt and black pants rather than her usual military-style uniform. Both she and the female officer beside her in the passenger seat were working undercover.\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nNueng\u0027s heart pounded. For more than two years, law enforcement agents from around the world had been hunting the dark-web mastermind known as Alpha02, a shadowy figure who oversaw millions of dollars a day in narcotics sales and had built the largest digital drug and crime bazaar in history, known as AlphaBay. Now, a coordinated takedown and sting involving no fewer than six countries\u0027 agencies had tracked Alpha02 to Thailand. The operation had finally led to this quiet block in Bangkok, to the home of a 26-year-old Canadian named Alexandre Cazes. Nueng knew that the success of the plot to arrest Cazes and knock out this linchpin of the global underworld economy hinged on what she did in the next few moments.\nTrying to give the impression of an inexperienced driver, Nueng slowly rolled the car toward a model home and real estate office at the end of the cul-de-sac. She signaled to a security guard outside the house that she had taken a wrong turn and needed to pull a 180. She heard him shout at her to back directly out instead, that the street was too narrow for a three-point turn.\nNueng quickly muttered a nearly silent prayer—an adapted, high-speed plea to the holy trinity of the Buddha, his teachings, and all the monks and nuns in his service. “Dear Buddha, please bless me with success,” she whispered in Thai. “Dear Dhamma, please bless me with success. Dear Sangha, please bless me with success.”\nThen she put the car in reverse, turned the wheel to the left, and ever so gently—almost in slow motion—slammed the Toyota\u0027s fender into Alexandre Cazes\u0027 front gate.\nCHAPTER 1\nALPHA02\nAROUND 18 MONTHS earlier, Robert Miller sat in the US Drug Enforcement Administration\u0027s wiretap room in Fresno, California, spending another painfully boring day listening in on the life of one of the DEA\u0027s endless supply of narcotics targets in California\u0027s Central Valley.\nAll Miller ever wanted was to be on a SWAT team. At the academy, instructors had praised him for his instinctive judgment and thoroughness—how, in training raids on the academy\u0027s mock-ups of drug dens, he always meticulously cleared his corners and covered his blind spots. And when the young DEA agent was assigned to the agency\u0027s field office in Fresno right after graduation, he had high hopes it would put him where he wanted to be: making arrests, carrying out search warrants, “hitting doors,” as he put it. (Miller\u0027s name and some personal details have been changed, per his request.)The sunbaked agricultural city in the middle of California had long served as a corridor for cocaine, heroin, weed, and methamphetamine smugglers, as traffickers from the southern border made their way to buyers in the Northwest and on the East Coast. Agents spent their days carrying out undercover buy-and-busts, following trucks packed with dope along Highway 99 and tracking, raiding, and arresting cartel operators.\nBut not long after he moved to Fresno, Miller injured his foot and his shoulder while rock climbing. Both injuries required surgery. There would be no SWAT team, no “hitting doors”—not, at least, for the two years it would take to recover.\nSo Miller was assigned to surveillance. He\u0027d stake out targets from his car or sit in the office\u0027s wiretap room, listening to suspects\u0027 phone calls and reading their texts for weeks or sometimes months on end. The work was often mind-numbingly mundane. “Ninety-nine percent boredom and 1 percent excitement,” as he remembers it.\nAt one point in 2013, Miller\u0027s partner on a surveillance assignment suggested they try to work on a new sort of case. She had heard about a booming drug market on the dark web called Silk Road—a site where anyone could connect through the anonymity software Tor and spend bitcoins to buy any drug imaginable—and its pseudonymous creator, the Dread Pirate Roberts. But when Miller asked his superiors about the site, he was told that teams in New York and Baltimore were already on it. Not long after, while Miller was on a surveillance stakeout in his car in a mall parking lot, his phone buzzed with an alert that the notorious market had been busted. The Dread Pirate Roberts turned out to be a 29-year-old Texan with no criminal record named Ross Ulbricht. He had been arrested in the science fiction section of San Francisco\u0027s Glen Park Public Library with his laptop open and logged in to Silk Road.\nTwo long years later, in early 2016, Miller\u0027s boss came into the wiretap room and asked whether Miller wanted to join a different team. Someone in the office had remembered Miller\u0027s inquiry into Silk Road. A local assistant US attorney had assembled a group to focus on dark-web crime, and he was looking for volunteers from all the federal agencies clustered around Courthouse Park in Fresno\u0027s downtown square: the Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The assignment, Miller knew, was pretty much the opposite of the SWAT team. But at least it would be something new. “OK,” he said. “I\u0027ll do it.”\nGRANT RABENN, THE young prosecutor at the helm of Fresno\u0027s dark-web strike force, laid out a set of modest initial goals for the group: They would be going after individual money launderers and drug dealers, not kingpins and masterminds. “We are not the Southern District of New York. We are in a dusty town in the Central Valley of California,” as Rabenn put it. “Let\u0027s hit singles before we try to go for a home run.”That humble starting point was fine with Miller, who had little idea of how the dark-web drug trade even worked. When Rabenn asked Miller to start making undercover heroin buys, he couldn\u0027t figure out how to buy bitcoins, let alone the drugs themselves. He drove two and a half hours to San Jose to find a physical bitcoin ATM rather than simply use an online exchange. Even then, he discovered that after transaction fees he could purchase only half a gram of heroin instead of the 2 grams he\u0027d planned on.\nBut slowly, as Miller poked around the dark web and perused the various markets, he got a feel for the post-Silk Road online drug economy. He soon came to see that it was dominated by a single entity: AlphaBay.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay companion newsletter. \nAlphaBay had first appeared in late 2014, just one in the broad scrum of markets vying for a share of the growing dark-web criminal trade. But the site\u0027s pseudonymous administrator, Alpha02, seemed cannier than those behind many of the competing markets. Alpha02 was a well known if not exceptionally talented “carder,” a cybercriminal hacker focused on credit card theft and fraud. He\u0027d become a significant player on Tor Carding Forum, a dark-web site where hackers traded in stolen data. He\u0027d even sold his own 16-page “University of Carding Guide,” designed to teach beginners the tricks of the trade, like how to “social-engineer” customer service representatives at banks, calling from spoofed telephone numbers to deceive them into approving fraudulent transactions.\nIn its first months online, AlphaBay seemed destined to serve much the same hacker clientele. It was devoted almost exclusively to cybercriminal wares, such as stolen account logins and credit card data. But as Alpha02 bootstrapped the site from its carder origins, its portfolio of vendors quickly expanded to offer the dark web\u0027s more lucrative contraband: ecstasy, marijuana, meth, cocaine, and heroin, all shipped through the mail. Soon it became clear that Alpha02\u0027s grand vision was to unite two spheres of the dark web that had, until then, been somewhat distinct—one devoted to cybercrime and the other to drugs—to create a single mega-market. AlphaBay\u0027s goal, he declared, was “to become the largest eBay-style underworld marketplace.”\nSilk Road\u0027s Dread Pirate Roberts had espoused a kind of anarcho-capitalist ideal, describing his site as a “movement” or a “revolution” bent on liberating mankind from oppressive government control of commerce and limiting sellers, at least in theory, to offering only “victimless” products. Alpha02, by contrast, seemed to adopt a much less high-minded focus on the bottom line. Aside from a ban on child abuse materials and murder for hire, the only rule Alpha02 imposed on AlphaBay\u0027s vendors was that they not sell data or accounts stolen from Russia or other former Soviet states, or infect those countries\u0027 computers with malware. This prohibition, common among cybercriminals from that part of the world, was typically designed to avoid trouble from Russian law enforcement—a kind of “don\u0027t shit where you sleep” principle. For Miller and other federal agents and prosecutors sniffing around the site, it also suggested that AlphaBay and its mysterious founder were likely based in Russia—an impression cemented by Alpha02\u0027s signature in messages on the site\u0027s forums: “Будьте в безопасности, братья,” Russian for “Be safe, brothers.”\nIn an interview in April 2015 with the news site and dark-web directory DeepDotWeb, Alpha02 reassured his users that he and his site were beyond the reach of any Silk Road-style seizure. “I am absolutely certain my opsec is secure,” he wrote, using the shorthand for “operational security,” and added, “I live in an offshore country where I am safe.”Throughout that interview, Alpha02 wrote in the style of a corporate press release: “We have made sure to have created a stable \u0026 fast marketplace web application which has been built with security in mind right from the start,” he wrote, adding, “We would like to assure all of our users (both vendors \u0026 buyers) that their security, privacy and anonymity rank first place in our priorities list.”\nWhat Alpha02 lacked in political inspiration he seemed to make up for in technological aspiration and coding competency. He boasted about features that included auction-style bidding, search tools that helped fraudsters comb through stolen data to carefully choose their victims, and a multi-signature transaction scheme designed to reassure users that it would be far harder for law enforcement or rogue staff to steal funds held in escrow.\nAmong digital crime investigators, Alpha02\u0027s notoriety was like that of Osama bin Laden. He and AlphaBay were invoked at every law enforcement conference on cybercrime, every interagency meeting, every training event.\n“We want to have every imaginable possible feature to be the #1 market,” he wrote to DeepDotWeb. On each page of AlphaBay, he\u0027d signed his work: “proudly designed by Alpha02.”\nWhen a judge imposed a double life sentence on the Silk Road\u0027s Ross Ulbricht in May 2015, she told the court that the draconian sentence was partly meant to scare off future dark-web drug buyers, dealers, and administrators. By the time of AlphaBay\u0027s rise, that unprecedented punishment seemed to have had the opposite effect. A study in The British Journal of Criminology found that sales on what was then the top dark-web site, Agora, more than doubled in the days following the news of Ulbricht\u0027s sentencing, to more than $350,000 a day. The study\u0027s author, trying to interpret that unexpected increase, reasoned that by imposing such a shocking prison term, the judge had only generated new awareness of the dark-web drug trade. Rather than deterring users, the judge seemed to have created a massive advertisement for the world\u0027s burgeoning cryptocurrency black markets.\nAlpha02 was hardly fazed by the news. Following Ulbricht\u0027s sentencing, in an interview with Vice\u0027s tech news site, Motherboard, he momentarily affected a revolutionary posture, picking up the Dread Pirate Roberts\u0027 torch. “Courts can stop a man, but they can\u0027t stop an ideology,” he wrote. “Darknet markets will always be around, until the war on drugs stops.”\nBut in response to other questions, AlphaBay\u0027s boss seemed to ditch the torch and speak more plainly. “We have to carry on with business,” he wrote. “We all need money to eat.”\nBY THE FALL of 2015, AlphaBay was the biggest market on the dark web. Agora\u0027s administrators had taken their site offline that August, citing concerns that a vulnerability in Tor, the online anonymity system that powered the dark web, might be used to locate Agora\u0027s servers. AlphaBay appeared to have no such security flaw. As it absorbed Agora\u0027s tens of thousands of buyers and vendors, the growing crowd of law enforcement agents around the world surveilling the site could find no coding or opsec slipups to give them the slightest clue as to where they might find its servers, not to mention its founder.\nShortly before AlphaBay took over the dark web\u0027s top spot, Alpha02 had changed his username on the site to merely “admin” and announced that he would no longer accept any private messages sent to him by anyone other than AlphaBay\u0027s staff. Instead, he left much of the site\u0027s communications work to his second-in-command and head of security, a figure who went by the pseudonym DeSnake.The Alpha02 moniker had served its purpose, lending the site its initial credibility. Now the person behind it intended, like discreet criminal bosses the world over, to slip into the shadows, raking in his fortune as quietly and anonymously as possible.\nThat fortune was, by the time of Alpha02\u0027s name change, growing at an unprecedented rate: By October 2015, AlphaBay had more than 200,000 users and more than 21,000 product listings for drugs, compared to just 12,000 listings on Silk Road at its peak. Sometime around the middle of 2016, AlphaBay surpassed Agora\u0027s peak sales rate of $350,000 a day, according to researchers at Carnegie Mellon. It had become not only the biggest black market on the dark web, but the biggest cryptocurrency black market of all time. And it was still growing wildly.\nFor Grant Rabenn, the Fresno-based prosecutor, it was clear that Alpha02 was now the most wanted man on the dark web; Rabenn compared his notoriety among digital crime investigators to that of Osama bin Laden. AlphaBay and Alpha02 were invoked at every law enforcement conference on cybercrime, every interagency meeting, every training event, Rabenn says. And as the target on Alpha02\u0027s back loomed larger, so too did the unspoken fear that this mastermind might stay a step ahead of them indefinitely.\n“Is this person just a pure genius who\u0027s figured out all of the possible mistakes?” Rabenn remembers asking himself. “Has this individual found the perfect country with the right IT infrastructure to run a marketplace, and he\u0027s able to bribe the officials there so we\u0027ll never touch him?\n“As every day passed there was, more and more, a sense that this might be the special one,” Rabenn says. “You begin to wonder: Is this the Michael Jordan of the dark web?”\nBut Rabenn followed these discussions of Alpha02 from a distance. The idea that his Fresno team might actually take on the Michael Jordan of the dark web had never occurred to him. “It\u0027s not expected for people like us,” he says simply, “to go after a site like that.”\nCHAPTER 2\nTHE TIP\nBEFORE GRANT RABENN became a federal prosecutor, his second job out of law school was at a boutique firm in Washington, DC, devoted to defending white-collar criminals. The young, olive-skinned lawyer with dark hair and a Hollywood smile ended up representing Russian oligarchs and corporate executives accused of bribing foreign governments. “Very interesting, wealthy people trying to hide their assets and avoid scrutiny,” as he described them, or alternatively, “James Bond characters who are jet-setting around the world with suitcases full of cash.”\nRabenn was captivated by these glimpses into a world of billions of dollars moving in invisible transactions. But he also found that he admired and envied the prosecutors on the other side of the table—the way they worked in the public interest and possessed a certain autonomy, choosing which cases they would pursue. So he began applying for Justice Department jobs, finally finding one in Fresno.Despite having grown up in Southern California, Rabenn couldn\u0027t place Fresno on a map. But when he arrived at its DOJ office in 2011, he found what he\u0027d always wanted: a place with almost no hierarchy or bureaucracy, where he was simply told to focus on money laundering and was otherwise given free rein. For the next few years, he and the local agents tackled fraud and extortion, child exploitation, corrupt cops, and, of course, drug trafficking—following illicit trails of money wherever they led. “We were just running and gunning,” Rabenn says of those prolific years with a boyish enthusiasm.\nRabenn\u0027s money-laundering cases often began with the stream of suspicious activity reports that banks were required to file under the Bank Secrecy Act. By mid-2013, Rabenn found that more and more of those reports were being triggered by financial transfers out of crypto exchanges, platforms where users could trade digital currency for traditional money like dollars, euros, or yen. The banks often suspected that these currency swaps were cash-outs of dirty digital profits. So Rabenn immersed himself in dozens of hours of YouTube videos to understand this still new currency called Bitcoin, its mechanics, and how it seemed to be powering an anonymous underworld of online commerce.\nCriminals flocked to these dark markets because the cryptocurrency was widely believed to be anonymous and untraceable. Sure, every transaction was immortalized on Bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, an unforgeable, unchangeable, and altogether public ledger. But that ledger recorded only which bitcoins resided at which Bitcoin addresses—long, unique strings of letters and numbers—at any given moment. In theory, at least, that meant buyers and sellers of illicit goods on opposite sides of the globe could send one another cash payments from behind the mask of those cryptic addresses without revealing any hint of their real-world identities.\nBut just as cryptocurrency-based platforms like AlphaBay opened up vast new global markets to criminals, they also opened up huge new opportunities for law enforcement, as Rabenn quickly realized. The dark web presented him with the chance to work cases on a scale that would otherwise be impossible in Fresno: As long as a dark-web drug dealer could be coaxed into sending a package to the Eastern District of California, the crime officially occurred in his jurisdiction.\nRabenn had no real idea how to pierce the veil of the blockchain\u0027s anonymity. But he figured that even dark-web dealers must sometimes make mistakes that could be caught through traditional buy-and-bust police work. For an ambitious young prosecutor, the possibility was thrilling. “I wasn\u0027t necessarily happy with just prosecuting drug mules driving meth up the 99 freeway,” he says. If he could arrange an undercover buy online and somehow identify the seller, he could arrest dealers all over the country. “All I have to do is order dope from them, and then we can go get them. And that\u0027s what we did.”\nIN 2014, RABENN began forming his dark-web strike force, inviting local investigators from Fresno\u0027s Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigations offices to join. It was a small team of “odd ducks,” as he describes them—agents on the more cerebral side, content to work cases largely on a computer screen instead of kicking down doors like their Central Valley colleagues.By the time he recruited Robert Miller out of the DEA\u0027s wiretap room, Rabenn\u0027s team had already achieved some success with their undercover approach. They\u0027d started by cracking down on a few so-called peer-to-peer exchangers—individuals who bought and sold bitcoins in the real world and were often used by dark-web dealers to cash out their dirty cryptocurrency. In several cases, they\u0027d mined those exchangers\u0027 Rolodexes for leads on the legal names of dealers who\u0027d done business with them, tracked them down, and arrested them.\nBut Rabenn had also begun to suspect that his original hunch was correct: Many of the dealers they targeted were indeed sloppy enough that agents could simply purchase drugs and look for clues either in their packaging or the vendors\u0027 online profiles.\nMiller, starting his new assignment, assembled the usernames of AlphaBay\u0027s top dealers of heroin and the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, and he began to buy from them one by one. As the packages arrived, triple-sealed in silver Mylar and plastic, Miller and the team scrutinized both the shipments and their sellers\u0027 online presence. They found that one vendor had made an elementary mistake: He\u0027d linked his PGP key—the unique file that allowed him to exchange encrypted messages with customers—with his email address on the PGP key server that stores a catalog of users\u0027 identities.\nMiller and Rabenn quickly tied that email to the dealer\u0027s social media accounts and real name. They learned that he was based in New York. Miller then found fingerprints on a package of heroin sent from one of his accounts, which matched those of another New York man. Finally, Miller worked with postal inspectors to get photos taken by a post office self-service kiosk. The photos showed the second New Yorker putting a dope shipment in the mail. Miller and a team of agents flew across the country, searched the two men\u0027s homes, and arrested them both.\nThe same simple PGP trick allowed Miller to find the real name of another dark-web opiates dealer—which turned out to be part of his dark-web handle, written backward—and caught him shipping dope, again using evidence from a post office kiosk camera. When agents raided the man\u0027s home in San Francisco, Miller says, they found piles of fentanyl and heroin powder sitting on tables and in open plastic containers.\nRabenn\u0027s team was now on a roll, building significant cases—and even a reputation. When Miller ordered a package of opiates addressed to Fresno, he was amused when his San Francisco suspect warned him that a particularly aggressive group of feds operating out of the Central Valley seemed to be targeting players on the dark web and that he\u0027d better watch his back.\nBut Miller and Rabenn didn\u0027t kid themselves: Busting a few of AlphaBay\u0027s sloppier dealers wasn\u0027t any more likely to topple that black market than the DEA was to defeat Mexican cartels by chasing yet another meth mule up Highway 99.\nBY NOVEMBER 2016, Miller was ready to try something new again. He\u0027d achieved a couple of decent dark-web busts, but he didn\u0027t love the paperwork or the weeks spent in front of a screen. His shoulder and foot had finally recovered. Perhaps it wasn\u0027t too late to get onto the SWAT team after all.Then, one afternoon, Miller returned to the office after picking up lunch, his In-N-Out Burger bag still in hand, to find an email from an intriguing stranger.\nThe email explained that the sender had been googling dark-web arrests, looking for a law enforcement contact. They\u0027d tried the FBI tip line, but no one had responded. They\u0027d tried Homeland Security—no luck there either. Finally, they\u0027d found Miller\u0027s contact information in one of the Fresno team\u0027s criminal indictments of an AlphaBay drug dealer.\nSo the stranger had decided to try getting in touch with Miller. And now they were ready to share a tip about who Alpha02 might really be.\nContinued in part 2: On the trail of a mastermind, a tip leads detectives to a suspect in Bangkok—and to the daunting task of tracing his millions in cryptocurrency.\nThis story is excerpted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Last year, investors pumped $23.7bn into startups associated with the idea, while Google search traffic for the term jumped by almost 10,000 percent. To some, this supposed ‘next version of the web’ promises not only a new era of online life, but nothing less than a new stage in the evolution of capitalism. “We\u0027re witnessing the birth of a new economic system,” wrote Artfunder founder Salvatore Delle Palme in his December blog post ‘On The Promise Of Web3’. “Its features and tenets are just now being devised and refined in transparent ways by millions of people around the world. Everyone is welcome to participate.”\nWIRED Consulting brings WIRED\u0027s network and knowledge to businesses and thought leaders. It is an independent entity separate from WIRED\u0027s newsroom. For more information visit consulting.wired.co.uk\nNot everyone has accepted the invitation. Some of the biggest names in technology have publicly poured scorn on Web3. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey dismissed it as a venture capitalist ploy. Elon Musk said it was just a marketing buzzword. Computer scientists and software developers have written eviscerating, widely shared essays with titles like ‘The Web3 Fraud’, ‘Web3 Is Bullshit’ and ‘Web3 Is A Stupid Idea’.\nSo what exactly is Web3, and is it the future? A January survey of 1,500 US consumers found that 54 percent had never even heard of it.\nWell, here’s the pitch. Web 1.0 was the first phase of the World Wide Web. This was the age of GeoCities, Netscape and bright blue hyperlinks. Webpages were static, interaction was minimal, and the online world was effectively a giant digital library – with added GIFs. This lasted until the mid-2000s when Web 2.0 came along. Suddenly, to publish something on the internet, you no longer needed to make a website and find someone to host it – and thus the web’s content consumers were now also its content creators. Blogs, comments, updates, posts, tweets and likes were everywhere. Where once you might have looked at Encarta online, you now searched Wikipedia – and perhaps also contributed to an entry. To quote Tim O’Reilly, the influential technologist who popularised the term Web 2.0 in 2004, this was “the web as platform”.\nHowever, some spied a problem. While Web 1.0 felt open and community-driven, Web 2.0 – which remains the web we have today – is dominated by a small number of companies. To critics, these tech giants account for a troubling share of internet use and global computing that focusses undue power in their hands. What they see as an unsettling business model also prevails: a devil’s bargain whereby users give up their data in exchange for free access to online services. Since the platforms control that data, you can’t easily take it with you if you wish to use a competitor. Oh, and all the clever things you post on social media? They don’t necessarily make a penny for you – but they make the platforms rich. In Web 2.0, we are the product.\nBut fear not, say the acolytes of Web3 (as they like to style it). In the next era we are going to fix all that. How? As if you needed to ask: blockchain.\nA QUICK OVERVIEW. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Simply put, it is an exhaustive record of all the transactions that happen within a network but it isn’t held on one central computer. Instead, all of the computers in that network have a complete copy of the record. New transactions are only added to the blockchain when a set threshold of computers agree they’re valid. That makes it theoretically tamper-proof and, if a government or hacker shuts down one computer, no bother: there are copies on countless other machines. A consequence of this model is that you don’t need a trusted third party to facilitate an interaction or grant permission for it to occur. Contrast that to paying a bill from your regular current account – the banks, and the regulators that govern them, mediate the whole process. With blockchain, power is decentralised, spread among the users of the network.\nTo those who believe that tech is too centralised, blockchains seem ideally suited to remake it. This is because they aren’t just about peer-to-peer currency. They can also run code. A blockchain like Ethereum, for instance, not only sustains the Ether cryptocurrency but also provides the means to run decentralised applications (known as dApps) or create decentralised business structures (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations, or DAOs). Unlike a regular app, a dApp doesn\u0027t require a central entity facilitating interactions (and typically taking a slice of the pie in return). Instead, users are connected directly with one another over a blockchain. Activities are automated by “smart contracts”: decentralised computer programs that also run on the blockchain. Ideally, the whole thing would be open-source, although in practice many dApps don\u0027t yet meet this criterion. But anything from a game to a social network could theoretically be a dApp. \nAn array of dApps already exist. LooksRare, for example, is a marketplace for buying NFTs that was built on the Ethereum blockchain. Right now, however, most are financial applications such as currency exchanges or lending platforms. That’s because “finance is just the area where centralised technology sucks the most”, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin told the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris last year. “I can send you a centralised email, and you will get it within one second. And sure, maybe various intelligence agencies will read it, but… at least you can read it one second from now. International bank wires do not work that way.”\nThe business models for dApps aren’t about gathering and selling data. Instead, they are typically predicated on “crypto tokens” (effectively a form of cryptocurrency). People who contribute to the dApp – perhaps by creating popular content or adding to its code – could be rewarded in these tokens. Users might also be able to acquire tokens either through buying them or via “staking” or “yield farming” – essentially, parking their tokens on the platform and earning interest on them. Ideally, these tokens would play into a governance model that furnishes holders with voting rights over the direction of the project. \nOf course, there has to be some other reason to consider these tokens valuable, so the dApp will come up with a way to create demand for them. If the dApp is a game, perhaps the tokens can buy you new weapons for your character, or if it’s a social network maybe the tokens can be exchanged for advertising space. The dApp’s value is thus distributed among its users rather than channelled towards a CEO. Theory goes, the desire to accumulate tokens and see them improve in value means that everyone is working in each others’ best interests.\nCrucially, because all user data sits on a blockchain – and individual users own and control their own data – they can take it with them if they wish to migrate from one dApp to another. In Web3, say proponents, we are no longer exploited.\nIn the case of a DAO, the business takes the form of a cooperative, owned by its members. There is no executive board wielding power, as all of the entity’s operations and transactions are managed by software: everything happens automatically according to predefined rules. dApps that aim to be truly decentralised are therefore usually managed by DAOs.\nThe DAO\u0027s software yet again takes the form of smart contracts. The only way their rules can be changed is by a vote – voting being the mechanism through which all human decision-making takes place. Again, crypto tokens are key. Typically, those who invest in the DAO receive tokens specific to the project, and those who carry out work for the DAO are also rewarded in these tokens. Those with more tokens have greater voting power. “A DAO is a group of people that come together around a shared community and a shared resource,” is how the software engineer Jonah Erlich explained it to The Verge in December. “The most fun description I’ve heard is that a DAO is a group chat with a bank account.” In November 2021, a DAO called ConstitutionDAO – in which Erlich had a key role – raised $47m to buy an original copy of the US Constitution at Sotheby’s. It failed, but only because it was outbid. \n“I think this is as big as it gets,” Nitin Sharma, general partner and global Web3 lead at the venture capital firm Antler, tells WIRED Consulting. “We\u0027re talking about essentially a completely new internet. It\u0027s not a sector. It\u0027s not a segment. It\u0027s really a layer. So it\u0027s essentially talking about how in five, 10, 20 years, everything we know about the internet could be different.”\nTHE IDEA OF WEB3 ISN\u0027T NEW. The first person to use the term in the current sense was Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood back in 2014. Writing on his blog, Wood argued the Edward Snowden leaks made clear that “entrusting our information to organisations in general is a fundamentally broken model”. He came up with the notion of Web3 as a possible solution, although – in light of Snowden – his vision for it also put an anonymous messaging system front and centre.\nIn late 2021 the term was rediscovered by Silicon Valley and became its buzzword of the moment, thanks in large part to the influential venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. In October 2021, Chris Dixon, who runs its crypto investments, wrote a Twitter thread that went viral. “Web 3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens,” he tweeted. “Before Web 3, users and builders had to choose between the limited functionality of Web 1 or the corporate, centralized model of Web 2. Web 3 offers a new way that combines the best aspects of the previous eras. It’s very early in this movement and a great time to get involved.” And get involved they did. Now you can’t move for “Web3 startups” – and seemingly any crypto-oriented idea or any new vision of how we’ll use the internet of tomorrow gets labelled “Web3”. Case in point: the so-called metaverse. “The metaverse” typically refers to a hypothetical network of virtual worlds – these don’t necessarily have to be built on a blockchain. But in some quarters the word “metaverse” has become almost interchangeable with “Web3”.\nCan you say bubble? Many have. More cynical commentators see the whole thing as a ruse to create demand for cryptocurrency – a way of bringing more people into the great crypto Ponzi scheme. Others have a more sober take: for all the excitement, Web3 does not actually exist. As Elon Musk put it in a tweet: “Has anyone seen web3? I can’t find it.” Sure, we have plenty of cryptocurrencies and NFTs; we even a multitude of dApps and DAOs – but the Web3 promise is that these will attract such overwhelming numbers of users that they will usher in a new phase of digital life. The term “Web 2.0” described a shift that had already happened, but Web3 is merely a forecast – and a bullish one at that. In 2021, Meta, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet reported combined annual revenues of $876bn, up 29 percent year-on-year. With the resources and expertise at these companies’ disposal, what are the chances that a new wave of community-driven projects will gain such force they will displace the old guard? The open source movement has shown the limitations of rule-by-crowd – progress tends to be sluggish, and the user experience often not up to muster.There’s also a good reason that centralised platforms emerged in the first place, as articulated forcefully by Moxie Marlinspike, founder of the messaging app Signal, in a January blog post. “In my mind the explanation is pretty simple: people don’t want to run their own servers, and never will…I don’t think this can be emphasized enough.” In other words, truly distributed infrastructure – which is what an ideal Web3 would depend on – may be a non-starter. And that’s before we get to the debates around the environmental costs and computational inefficiencies of such a setup. As the software engineer Stephen Diehl put it on his blog: “The Ethereum virtual machine has the equivalent computational power of an Atari 2600 from the 1970s except it runs on casino chips that cost $500 a pop and every few minutes we have to reload it like a slot machine to buy a few more cycles. That anyone could consider this to be the computational backbone to the new global internet is beyond laughable.” We asked him: does he not think the natural course of technological advance will ultimately address these shortcomings? After all, anyone living in the 1960s would have been wrong to write off a personal computing revolution simply because of the size and cost of existing computers. “I don\u0027t think this is just like the early internet or somehow the march of progress will somehow fix it,” he tells WIRED Consulting. “You solve this problem by doing one thing – by centralising it – at which point you\u0027ve destroyed the entire premise of Web3.”\nBut let’s put those issues to one side for a moment. Let’s imagine that Web3 materialises and the blockchain becomes the online master spirit. Would it actually cure the web’s ills – or, as many fear, would the lack of central governance lead to a rise in hate speech, inappropriate content and criminal activity? There’s a site called Web3IsGoingJustGreat.com which chronicles the crises and follies of the crypto world. At the bottom is a counter that shows “a running total of the amount of money lost so far to grifts and scams”. When we last visited, the number was $10.896bn. Lavinia Osbourne, founder of Women In Blockchain Talks and creator of the Crypto Kweens NFT marketplace, tells WIRED Consulting that the answer will be legislation. “You don\u0027t have the same moderating element, but this is why regulation and compliance come into place,” she says. “Decentralisation is not the devil – it is how people choose to use it, just like the internet, just like the Bible.” Right now, how those laws would work is a matter of conjecture. “They don’t exist yet because the infrastructure’s not there yet. Until you have the problem, you can\u0027t create a solution to it. If you try and preempt it, then that means sometimes you can be a little bit too heavy handed.”\nDetractors also question the premise that the Web3 model would necessarily lead to decentralisation. Why shouldn’t it merely lead to concentrations of power elsewhere? The Wall Street Journal reports that 0.01 percent of Bitcoin users control 27 percent of all Bitcoin in circulation – would ownership of a DAO necessarily be any different? And when organisations such as cryptocurrency exchanges are so important in the crypto ecosystem, wouldn’t they just become the new tech giants? Certainly the billions of dollars in venture capital flows driving the current Web3 mania seem incompatible with the idealism: VCs tend to want the enterprises they back to end up making a lot of money. Hence Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s broadside in December. “You don’t own ‘web3.’ The VCs and their LPs do,” he tweeted. “It will never escape their incentives. It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label. Know what you’re getting into…”Chris Dixon, the Andreessen Horowitz VC who popularised the term, responded:\n“first they ignore you\nthen they laugh at you\nthen they fight you 👈 we are here\nthen you win”\nIT\u0027S TELLING HOW VIGOROUS the debates about Web3 can get. Partly that’s because to talk about it is a discussion about politics as much as technology.\nThe early web was wrapped up in a profound conviction that it could mend humanity. The zeitgeist was captured neatly by the digital-rights activist John Perry Barlow in his 1996 paper “A Declaration Of The Independence Of Cyberspace”:\n“We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity…We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.”\nIn the years that followed, the prevailing tone of the tech world shifted away from that kind of utopianism. But Web3 has spurred a revival; to true believers, the web once again holds the promise of salvation. And that element of faith – faith that Web3 will happen, faith that it will restore digital life to its prelapsarian state – perhaps offers a useful way to consider our original question: is Web3 the future?\nLike most doctrines, it surely contains a kernel of truth. Whatever your views on it, this Web3 moment at the very least signals widespread discontent with the current state of the internet – and brings home how pressing it is that this must be tackled. “But these are not technical problems, these are problems of business design and policy,” the futurist Gerd Leonhard tells WIRED Consulting. In his view, the aims of Web3 – privacy, encryption, bringing power back to users – are therefore not going to be achieved by introducing “some miraculous technology”. He expects that meaningful solutions will come in more conventional form than blockchains. These might be new regulations that insist on making user data portable, say, or simply the proliferation of business models that don’t incentivise companies to watch and track our behaviour online. “We\u0027re going to start paying for things like search engines and social media sites,” he says. “This payment-based approach is going to really make a very big difference. The model of surveillance is dying, because we are moving into a world where in 2030, we\u0027re going to have roughly nine billion people on the internet. Today it’s 4.6 [billion]. So you can only imagine that if we perfect surveillance and tracking, then we\u0027re gonna live in a total panopticon. That\u0027s just not going to be good for anybody.”\nWe would venture that another truth of Web3 is that blockchains aren’t going away. So, might “Web3” ideas – digital currencies, NFTs, dApps – gain further traction while centralised internet businesses continue to exist? That doesn’t seem like a stretch. Clearly, the notion that the internet has distinct “versions” is an artificial construct.Perhaps, then, a more useful question than whether Web3 is the future is: which blockchain-based projects are the ones that really matter? In his 2005 essay “What Is Web 2.0” Tim O’Reilly reflected on the dotcom bust, and how it sifted the wheat from the chaff among early internet companies. When bubbles burst, he argued, “the pretenders are given the bum\u0027s rush, the real success stories show their strength, and there begins to be an understanding of what separates one from the other.” If the crypto economy weathered a similar shakeout, which “Web3” ideas would live on?\nChances are, the survivors would offer something that wouldn’t be as effective in non-blockchain form, and which would present the user with an overwhelmingly good reason to use them instead of more traditional alternatives. The successful projects are also likely to be the ones where the technicalities fade into the background, and notions of blockchains are as far from the user\u0027s mind as HTML or DNS. The user doesn\u0027t care if an app\u0027s ‘decentralised’ – they just want it to work.\nIf such apps do materialise, they may do things we can\u0027t conceive of yet, in the same way as somebody using a home computer in the 1980s could not have imagined what problems that tool would end up solving. We might think we know what Web3 or Web 2.5 or Web 10 – or whatever you want to call it – will look like. But nothing ages as fast as the future.\nFor more information about WIRED Consulting, visit consulting.wired.co.uk\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","tags":["","WIRED CONSULTING"],"author":"BY CHARLIE BURTON","creation_date":"2022-10-18"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/celsius-user-data-dump-crypto-tracing-scammers/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"By releasing half a million users’ transactions in a bankruptcy court filing, the company has opened a vast breach in its users’ financial privacy.","title":"Celsius Exchange Leak Is a Gift to Crypto Sleuths—and Thieves","detailed_content":"THE PARADOXICAL NATURE of cryptocurrency\u0027s privacy is that the blockchain, that unchangeable ledger of all a cryptocurrency\u0027s transactions, serves as both a map and a mask: Bitcoin are easy enough to follow from one address to the next.

But this one is strange.\nBinance revealed Friday that unidentified hackers managed to exploit a flaw in the company\u0027s BNB Chain crypto token, allowing them to mint 2 million of the company’s decentralized tokens worth a total of $569 million. That money wasn’t actually stolen from Binance, in other words, but rather fabricated out of thin air thanks to a flaw in the security of Binance’s cryptocurrency. But the hack nonetheless seemed poised to flood the market with BNB and thus reduce its value for legitimate owners, while allowing the hackers to walk away with half a billion dollars.\nUnfortunately for those hackers, even they didn’t seem prepared for their sudden windfall. Cryptocurrency-tracing firm Elliptic found that they quickly traded away some fraction of their tokens for a variety of other cryptocurrencies. That allowed them to obtain about $53 million in Ethereum-based tokens. But other cryptocurrencies that they traded their BNB for, like Tether and USDC, are more centrally controlled, allowing the funds to be frozen. Binance, meanwhile, managed to temporarily shut down its BNB blockchain to prevent the hackers’ newly mined currency from moving further. “So we have a very sophisticated exploit, managing to mint yourself $569 million,” says Elliptic research lead Thibaud Madelin. “But what followed was a complete shambles, to be honest.”In the end, Elliptic believes the hackers kept hold of less than 10 percent of their loot—not bad for a day’s work but little more than a blip in the wild world of digital money.\nFeds Warn Hackers Breached a US Military Network\nA joint advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the FBI, and the NSA warned that the network of an unnamed military agency or contractor had been breached by a so-called “advanced persistent threat” hacker group, an industry code phrase for state-sponsored hackers. According to the alert, the spies maintained their access inside the network for around 10 months, penetrating a Microsoft Exchange server where they installed a commonly used backdoor known as China Chopper. The hackers also used a tool called Impacket to move from machine to machine and another tool called CovalentStealer to siphon data from their targets. As is often the case with government alerts, the advisory didn\u0027t attribute the breach to any particular country\u0027s government, nor even a known hacker group. The eagle-eyed (or vulture-eyed) Register spotted that the advisory initially included a box at the top suggesting organizations “protect against Russian-state sponsored malicious cyber activity,” which was later deleted. But others, like cybersecurity firm AttackIQ, point to Chinese calling cards in the intrusion.\nA Modified Tor Browser Is Tracking the Location and Browsing Histories of Chinese Users\nSince early this year, hackers have been distributing a tainted version of the Tor Browser that collects personal data about Chinese users including form data they submit, browsing history, location data, and computer name, according to security firm Kaspersky. The Tor Browser is meant to be an anonymity-focused tool that is often used in countries like China where users are seeking to circumvent government-imposed internet restrictions, tracking, and censorship. Kaspersky found that the attackers advertised the malicious app by including a link to download it in a video posted to a popular Chinese-language YouTube channel. The video has more than 64,000 views. The installer for the malicious browser includes a compromised version of Tor that siphons victim data and sends it to attackers.\nIsabela Fernandes, executive director of the nonprofit Tor Project, told CyberScoop that there is now a patch available. “Basically this ‘poisoned’ Tor Browser modifies the update URL so it cannot be updated normally. What we did was to add a redirect so we are responding to the modified URL, this way people will update. Now their URL is a working update URL.”\nFCC Takes Anti-Robocalling Enforcement Action Against Seven Voice Service Providers\nAs part of its push to crack down on robocalling, the US Federal Communications Commission said this week that it is taking seven voice over IP services off of its trusted carriers list unless they add legally required robocall protections. The move would essentially block the services from being able to complete calls in the US. “Fines alone aren’t enough,” the FCC wrote in its announcement. “Providers that don’t follow our rules and make it easy to scam consumers will now face swift consequences.”","tags":["","SECURITY ROUNDUP","RUSSIA","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FCC"],"author":"BY LILY HAY NEWMAN","creation_date":"2022-10-08"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/hottest-startups-amsterdam-2022/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Amsterdam continues to punch well above its weight, combining tech powerhouse status with being one of the most livable cities on the continent.","title":"The Hottest Startups in Amsterdam","detailed_content":"“AMSTERDAM IS A global city—with a population of less than 1 million,” says Ferdinand Goetzen, CEO of Amsterdam-based digital customer-insight business, Reveall.

It’s little surprise then that entrepreneurs with a progressive streak have long stalked the narrow cobbled streets of its capital, Stockholm. Here, a city renowned for great ideas, design, and innovation has become a tightly packed startup haven overlooking the Baltic Sea. World-famous names like Spotify and Klarna have already changed how we listen to music and shop. Now, a fresh crop of mission-focused disruptors want to reshape how we think, from our everyday health and business to our longer-term earthly conservation.\n“Stockholm is big enough not to create negative competition, but small enough so that everyone knows everyone on the entrepreneurial and investor side,” explains Charlotte Ekelund, CEO of workplace collaboration tool Teemyco. “The ecosystem here is based on friendship and helpfulness. We as a people in Sweden are keen on the common good: sustainability and mission is talked about a lot here.”\nTreyd\nFor Treyd cofounder Peter Beckman, the comparisons with Klarna are inevitable. But his startup offers the Buy Now, Pay Later model to businesses rather than consumers. “30 percent of world trade is paid by cash in advance,” explains Beckman. “Banks can’t give loans to companies whose entire assets are in a factory tens of thousands of miles away. So, we provide the capital.”\nTreyd fulfills supplier invoices on behalf of businesses, which have up to 120 days to pay the loan back. In that time, direct-to-consumer brands can receive their goods, sell them, and have cash flow. Founded in 2019 by Beckman and Sameh El-Ansary, Treyd’s early years have coincided with supply chains creaking from the pressures of Covid-19 and the Suez Canal blockage. That’s been good news for Beckman. “We’re at the stage where 20 percent of all our clients ever have come from the previous 30 days. Brands have been forced to place orders much earlier, meaning they’ve had to pay for orders much earlier.” Treyd raised £8.4 million (around $9.45 million) in a Series A round in May ahead of expansion to the UK. treyd.io\nLEIA\nAccording to the World Health Organization, an estimated 140 million babies are born every year worldwide. And according to Astrid Gyllenkrok Kristensen, cofounder of femtech startup LEIA, 90 percent of mothers will experience some mental or physical difficulties within 12 months of giving birth. That was the experience of cofounder, Sandra Wirström, who suffered life-changing postpartum injuries following a medical misdiagnosis. “When I was pregnant, I had instant access to health care, a good understanding of the different trimesters, and hundreds of apps to choose from,” adds Kristensen. “When my pregnancy ended, so did the focus on me as a woman: All the health care, information, and apps shifted to the baby.”\nLEIA, founded in 2021, aims to redress that balance. Its post-pregnancy health app is a personalized digital tracker for new mothers. “By building screening models for postpartum depression and pelvic dysfunction, we can identify women at risk at a much earlier stage—even before health care providers,” adds Kristensen. Since going live in February, 20 percent of users have been identified as being at risk of postpartum depression. LEIA has raised £560,000 (around $630,200) in pre-seed funding. meetleia.comJohan Pihl and Mathias Wikstöm, cofounders of climate fintech Doconomy.PHOTOGRAPH: CHRISTOPHER HUNT\nDoconomy\nClimate fintech Doconomy calculates the environmental cost of every purchase made on its DO credit card. Fed through its API, each transaction is presented in both krona and a carbon footprint rating based on company or merchant category. But the technology aims to do more than raise awareness: Its app also enables customers to take action, offering carbon offsetting options and donations toward global sustainability projects.\nDoconomy’s technology has been integrated across Mastercard’s global network; its Impact API has now processed data from more than 2 billion transactions, reaching over 750 million users. Founded by Mathias Wikström and Johan Pihl in 2018, it’s totaled £15.5 million (around $17.4 million) in funding. “Ultimately it’s about disclosing the blind spots of impact,” Wikström says. “We make sure we help facilitate reduction in line with net-zero targets, for both individuals and corporations.” doconomy.com\nCling Systems\nWilliam Bergh had the idea to develop a trading platform for used EV batteries while completing his master’s thesis, which involved research at Stockholm sustainable battery maker Northvolt. “I saw a gap in the market: There was no clarity on where batteries actually end up with existing systems,” says Bergh. Cling Systems, founded in 2020, connects the ecosystem to ensure batteries are reused, repurposed, and recycled. In a January pre-seed funding round, it raised £1.7 million (around $1.9 million) to help build a real-time map of used batteries to ensure maximum commercial and environmental benefits. Its existing supply includes 2,500 batteries from more than 50 sellers in the Nordics and Netherlands. clingsystems.com\nMindler\nThis digital therapy service connects patients to mental health professionals with just a few taps of the screen. Since launching in 2018, Mindler has hosted more than 375,000 digital psychologist visits; video call sessions are combined with in-app treatment plans. Its popularity surged during Covid lockdowns, with monthly active users having more than quadrupled to 13,000 since the pandemic. Cofounded by physician Rickard Lagerqvist and psychologists Rickard Färdig and Johannes Hatem, it’s since expanded to four more markets—including the UK—and raised nearly £34 million (around $38 million) in funding. mindlercare.com\nClimateView\nFrom Malmö to Dundee, Cincinnati to Nottingham, ClimateView helps cities around the world reach net-zero through its ClimateOS platform. Local authorities manage, track, and then execute data-led climate action plans in the transition toward zero-carbon economies. “Cities need better intelligence to make collaborative climate decisions,” explains ClimateView cofounder Tomer Shalit. A former IT consultant, he previously provided agile solutions to banks and insurance firms. “If they use these methods to solve complex problems effectively, why not apply them to the most important problem of all?” Founded alongside Jeff Goens and Einar Bodstrom, it most recently raised a £8.6 million ($9.7 million) Series A round. climateview.global\nPocketLaw\nFormer M\u0026A lawyer Kira Unger and ex-McKinsey consultant Olga Beck-Friis launched legal tech startup PocketLaw in 2018 to cut through the red tape that often ensnares small- and medium-size businesses. Its contract creation and management platform is now used by more than 6,000 companies, easing the burden of everyday legal needs by digitizing day-to-day paperwork. Since launching in 2020, PocketLaw has quadrupled in size year after year. It’s also opened a London office, with a team of lawyers adapting the tech to the nuances of UK company law. In May, it raised £8.5 million ($9.6 million) in Series A funding. pocketlaw.com\nSelah Rui Li and Marc van Almkerk, cofounders of Ellure.PHOTOGRAPH: CHRISTOPHER HUNT\nEllure\nEllure’s cosmetic IoT-enabled 3D printers are able to design, formulate, and manufacture lipstick on-demand in minutes. Not only does that mean 10,000 shades to pick from, but waste and overproduction typically found in the beauty industry is dramatically reduced—applicator tops, for instance, are 3D-printed from corn-based materials. “Our research shows 7 percent of cosmetics and 14 percent of lipsticks are unsold at retail because customer demand cannot be estimated wholly accurately,” explains cofounder Selah Rui Li, who launched the startup in 2019 alongside Marc van Almkerk. Following a small-scale pilot in the US and funding from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, Ellure is moving toward its first product launch this year. ellure.io\nDework\nDework has been touted as the LinkedIn for Web3: a decentralized job marketplace for crypto and blockchain gig workers. Founded by Lonis Hamaili and David Fant, the collaboration tool enables decentralized autonomous organizations to recruit, organize teams, manage projects, and pay contributors with native tokens. Conversely, contributors can connect their personal Discord account to the platform, build a profile, and sign smart contracts that match their skillsets. Fresh from a £4 million ($4.5 million) pre-seed funding round led by Paradigm and Pace Capital and joined by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, the platform already boasts 11,000 users following its December 2021 launch. dework.xyz\nValidio\nData engineering is typically a complex business. Validio helps strip that back. Its platform enables even one-man teams to have capabilities closer to a Silicon Valley giant: Through machine learning technology, unknown data failures can be easily caught and data quality can be automatically validated. Founded by Patrik Tran, Urban Eriksson, and Oliver Molander in 2019, it’s now a Google Cloud build partner. Among Validio’s clients are Stockholm escooter startup Voi and digital electricity supplier Tibber. In June, it raised £12.2 million (around $13.8 million) in seed funding led by Lakestar, an early backer of the likes of Spotify and Revolut. Among the angel investors?

But even as those global sanctions have carefully excised Russia from global commerce, millions of dollars have continued to flow directly to Russian military and paramilitary groups in a form that’s proven harder to control: cryptocurrency.\nSince Russia launched its full-blown invasion of Ukraine in February, at least $4 million worth of cryptocurrency has been collected by groups supporting Russia’s military in Ukraine, researchers have found. According to analyses by cryptocurrency-tracing firms Chainalysis, Elliptic, and TRM Labs, as well as investigators at Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, recipients include paramilitary groups offering ammunition and equipment, military contractors, and weapons manufacturers. That flow of funds, often to officially sanctioned groups, shows no sign of abating and may even be accelerating: Chainalysis traced roughly $1.8 million in funding to the Russian military groups in just the past two months, nearly matching the $2.2 million it found the groups received in the five months prior. And despite the ability to trace those funds, freezing or blocking them has proven difficult, due largely to unregulated or sanctioned cryptocurrency exchanges—most of them based in Russia—cashing out millions in donations earmarked for invaders.\n“Our aim is to identify all the crypto wallets being used by Russian military groups and the people helping them; to find, seize and block all this activity that is helping to buy the bullets, the ammunition of this occupation,” says Serhii Kropyva, who until recently served as deputy of Ukraine’s Cyber Police and advisor to the country’s prosecutor general. “With the close cooperation of companies like Chainalysis and Binance, we can see all the wallets involved in this criminal activity, these money flows of millions of dollars. But we can, unfortunately, see that the transfer is continuing all the time.”\nFEATURED VIDEO\nA Timeline of Russian Cyberattacks on Ukraine\nIn separate reports, the cryptocurrency-tracing firms and Binance’s investigations team each tracked donations to the Russian war effort that very often began with public posts on the messaging app Telegram soliciting crowdfunded donations. Chainalysis, for instance, found Telegram posts from organizations including the pro-Russian media sites Rybar and Southfront, as well as the paramilitary group Rusich—which has ties to the notorious Wagner mercenary group—all posting cryptocurrency donation addresses to Telegram. These posts told followers that the money raised there would be used for everything from weaponized drones to radios, rifle accessories, and body armor. In another instance, Chainalysis points to a fundraiser by a group called Project Terricon that attempted to auction NFTs to support pro-Russian militia groups in Eastern Ukraine, though the NFTs were removed from the marketplace they were hosted on before any bids were placed.\nBinance’s investigations team, in its own report, found that a total of $4.2 million in crypto had been funneled to Russian military groups since February. The groups named in its research didn’t entirely overlap with those named in Chainalysis’ report, suggesting that the overall funding could be far greater than either Binance’s or Chainalysis’ total. Binance, for instance, points to a pro-Russian “cultural heritage” group known as MOO Veche that has carried out fundraisers for military equipment similar to the kinds funded by the groups Chainalysis flagged. While Binance, TRM Labs, and Elliptic all name MOO Veche as a major fundraiser, Elliptic traced $1.7 million in crypto donations to the group, far more than the other researchers.A screenshot of a Russian-language Telegram post from the pro-Russian military MOO Veche group, describing equipment paid for with its fundraising, including “thermal imagers, binoculars with rangefinders, spotting scopes, car radios, collimators and first aid kits.“\nTELEGRAM VIA ANDY GREENBERG\nOther organizations that Binance spotted raising money through cryptocurrency crowdfunding on Telegram include the pro-Russian nationalist groups Save Donbas and REAR, as well as the Russian arms manufacturer Lobaev, which it saw directly soliciting donations on the platform. Yet another group, known as Romanov Light, whose fundraising was spotted by TRM Labs and Elliptic, claimed to be collecting crypto for Russian special forces. Romanov Light raised as much as $330,000 worth of donations, according to Elliptic, which it told donors it spent on military equipment like weapon accessories, flashlights, and armor plates.\nDespite the relative clarity of all that financial tracing, preventing cryptocurrency from continuing to bolster Russia’s unprovoked incursion into Ukraine hasn’t been simple. Exchanges can block or freeze funds at the points where they’re exchanged for traditional currency. But according to Chainalysis, the majority of the crypto funds the groups have raised have been cashed out through what the company calls \"high-risk\" Russian exchanges with little to no precautions against criminal money-laundering. In previous reports, Chainalysis has named Chatex, Suex, and Garantex as examples of those Russia-based rogue exchanges—all of which have already been targeted with Western sanctions for their extensive use by criminals. Chatex and Garantex did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. Suex no longer appears to have a public website, and no contact information for the exchange could be found.\nNot every exchange that has served as an ATM for Russian military crypto crowdfunding is hosted in Russia, however. Blockchain analysts who spoke to WIRED pointed to seven other exchange services, some hosted in India and China, that have received funds from the pro-Russian groups they tracked, though they declined to name them on the record, in part because the amounts of those funds in most cases were in the single-digit thousands or less.In one telling example of how hard it is to prevent these cash-outs, however, analysts saw MOO Veche send more than $150,000 worth of bitcoin to an exchange hosted on the infrastructure of the Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi—a “nested” exchange that essentially uses Huobi as its trading platform. But any responsibility that Huobi might have for blocking or freezing those funds was complicated by another unknown intermediary service that analysts saw the money travel through before entering the Huobi-hosted service. When WIRED reached out to Huobi for comment, it wrote in a statement that it has a “know-your-customer” process “which ensures to the best of our ability that our clients’ source of funds are above board.”\nBinance, for its part, says its exchange accounts were also used by four of the groups it tracked and received more than $208,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. It tells WIRED that it froze all four accounts it discovered. “We’re making sure that no harm comes to civilians as a result of the fundraising that happens in these extremist spaces,” says Jennifer Hicks, who manages Binance’s intelligence and investigations team. “When cryptocurrency exchanges know that something illicit is happening that will end in real-world, kinetic effects like this, it’s the exchange’s responsibility to put a stop to it as fast as possible.”\nEven when exchanges do monitor for crypto sent from sanctioned groups like these pro-Russian fundraisers, that dirty money won’t always be straightforward to detect, warns Thibaud Madelin, who leads research at Elliptic. He says he’s increasingly seeing Russian sources of illicit funds use “bridges” or “coin swaps”—services that allow easy trading of one cryptocurrency for another, often without offering any identifying information—as money-laundering techniques. He’s watched those tools grow in popularity among dark-web black markets and cybercriminal users and expects the same will happen with those seeking to launder illicit arms funding. “It’s a bit early to say definitively. But what we’re seeing is that it’s likely to become a bigger problem,” says Madelin. “They’re likely to mirror the methodologies seen across dark net services users, enabling large-scale money laundering and potentially sanctions evasion.”\nAn image in Chainalysis’s report pulled from a pro-Russian social media fundraiser that shows items funded through cryptocurrency donations, including targeting equipment, drone components, and satellite radios.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINANALYSISMillions of dollars in cryptocurrency funding to Russian troops may be the least of Ukraine’s problems in a war where Russia has thrown billions into its invasion force. Ukraine, it’s worth noting, has also vastly out-raised Russia in cryptocurrency: By Elliptic’s count, the Ukrainian government has collected more than $77 million in crypto donations since the war began. But that is to be expected, given the West’s broad support of Ukraine following Russia’s unprovoked aggression and the global sanctions placed on Russia. And even the smaller amount of cryptocurrency Russian forces have raised demonstrates cryptocurrency’s ongoing potential to circumvent those sanctions and offer another financial lifeline to Russia’s war machine.\n“It’s not like Russia is buying new tanks with this money. They’re paying for thermal imaging scopes and UAVs,” says Andrew Fierman, a sanctions-focused Chainalysis researcher. “But for grassroots facilitation of these militia efforts, any amount of money that they receive to bolster their gear is going to have an impact.” And despite all the light that cryptocurrency tracers can shine on that funding—and the West’s best efforts to stop it—the crypto flow into Russia’s war chest continues.\nUpdate 10-7-22, at 9:40 am: We’ve updated the story to clarify that Chainalysis says the crypto donations to Russian groups went to “high risk” Russian exchanges. Chainalysis has named Suex, Chatex, and Garantex as examples of such exchanges in the past, but did not directly name them in its most recent report.","tags":["","RUSSIA","UKRAINE","CRYPTOCURRENCY"],"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","creation_date":"2022-10-07"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/google-for-startups-eastern-europe/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"A string of tech hubs, from Tallinn to Prague, are breeding blessings of unicorns and pulling in new levels of international investment.

Early success stories such as Skype, developed in Tallinn, LogMeIn (now GoTo), founded in Budapest, and UIPath (founded in Bucharest and launched on the NYSE last year at $30bn), have helped foster a dynamic ecosystem.\nGoogle for Startups’ Joanna Nagadowska says the region’s tech sector is being driven by a “positive flywheel” as it matures, with savvy and seasoned local talent now launching their own startups. “Central and Eastern Europe today is not an overnight success. It was built on a generation of entrepreneurs who know how to start and scale businesses.”\nWe’ve highlighted five key Central and Eastern Europe cities, including Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital’s tech sector has such momentum that it continues to grow, despite the Russian invasion. Warsaw remains the region’s tech hub and a number of Ukrainian startups have satellite offices in the city. Tallinn births more startups per capita than anywhere in Europe, while Vilnius has leveraged its liveability to develop a vibrant tech ecosystem. Prague has global credentials in developing cybersecurity tech, but boasts a growing and quickly diversifying startup scene.\nKyiv\nBefore the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv was the rising star of the European startup scene. It was the launch site for six unicorns, from GitLab to NFT pioneer Unstoppable Domains and workflow automation star, AirSlate—the latter two went unicorn this summer.\nThe IT sector is still growing in Ukraine, with many startups opening satellite offices in other countries, particularly Poland. Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the $5m Google for Startups Ukraine Support Fund, providing cash awards and mentoring support.\nElai.io was one of the first beneficiaries of the Ukraine Support Fund, and was launched in Kyiv last year by Vitalii Romanchenko, Alex Uspenskyi and Aleksey Pshenichniy, all relative veterans of the Kyiv tech scene.\nLeveraging advanced AI, Elai.io’s Software as a Service tool allows users to easily create videos using just text, putting words in the mouths of digital avatars. It offers a library of templates and animations, works in over 65 languages, and the avatars are based on a diverse range of real-life actors.\nRomanchenko argues that despite the vitality of the startup scene in Kyiv, and the depth of talent in the city, there is need for more outside investment. \"Kyiv is home to thousands of skilled engineers and IT professionals,” he says. “We have people who know how to build awesome products while working in big offshore businesses but a lot of time we lack individuals who actually start their own companies. We need help with building a stronger startup ecosystem, and getting more VCs and angels involved to support early-stage companies.\"\nThe Google for Startups Campus in Warsaw\nANNA LIMINOWICZ\nWarsaw\nGoogle for Startups opened its Warsaw Campus back in 2015, since then almost 100,000 startups and community members have visited. The city has also become a satellite base for Ukrainian tech firms, with Google for Startups providing workspace for firms in temporary exile. “The Google for Startups Campus in Warsaw is our hub for Central and Eastern Europe. It was built on a strong commitment to support this incredibly diverse startup ecosystem with its almost 200 million people across over a dozen countries. Especially in Poland we see an emerging number of unicorns like Allegro or Docplanner, fuelled by a solid pipeline of rising stars like Booksy, Brainly, ICEYE, Tylko or Packhelp. They are all testament to the strong momentum we see for Eastern European startups today.” says Michal Kramarz, head of Google for Startups, Central Europe.\n\"We strongly believe our platform will change how primary care is delivered,\" says Agata Mlodawska, content lead at Polish startup Infermedica. The HealthTech startup, an alumn of the Google for Startups programme, has a mission, she adds, to \"make healthcare accessible, affordable and convenient by automating primary care processes, from symptom to outcome\".Mlodawska says the city’s tech scene now needs to pick up on Google for Startups’ approach to shared growth. “We need more tech and growth meetups to share knowledge and experience, not only on technology but also about sales, scaling, building company culture and hiring.”\nVilnius\nPut simply, the Lithuanian government is extremely startup-friendly, and the capital, dotted with accelerators, has cultivated a close-knit business community. The pandemic has seen Lithuanians return to the capital from around Europe, and the city is also welcoming disgruntled tech talent from neighboring Belarus.\nFintech is a particular strength, but the city’s startup ecosystem is deep and broad: take the mobility platform Trafi; Blockchain banking platform Bankera; and fashion resale marketplace Vinted — its first unicorn.\nVilnius-based Kamilė Jokubaitė is cofounder and CEO of Software as a Service platform Attention Insight, which uses eye-tracking and AI to create attention heat maps, helping companies to make their landing pages, marketing and packaging as eye-catching as possible. Jokubaitė, who is a Google for Startups alum, explains that “we are forming a new niche in the market which perceives AI as our colleague—a way to do our work better, not as a threat taking over our jobs.”\nJokubaitė says Vilnius-based startups are a perhaps a little too reticent and slow to claim the attention they deserve. And argues that the Google for Startups programme has been a confidence booster and a space to share successes and failures. \"The program united cofounders into peer groups where we share our knowledge and experience of overcoming challenges,\" she says. \"It enables founders to create new products and projects without repeating mistakes.\"\nTallinn\nTallinn is a small but mighty tech-sector powerhouse, leading the rest of Europe in terms of startup creation and VC investment per capita. The customer relations management platform Pipedrive, and mobility app Bolt—both unicorns—are just two digital headliners launched in the Estonian capital. But it is Skype, developed in Tallinn in 2003, that established a model for the tech sector’s development as well as creating a funding and talent ecosystem that helped launch successive waves of startups in the city, including Transferwise (now known as Wise), Pipedrive, robot delivery specialist Starship Technologies, and the identity verification service, Veriff.\nLaunched in 2015, Veriff verifies customer identity using AI-powered factors including facial recognition, and behavioural and technological indicators, that show an individual is who they say they are. Its founder, Kaarel Kotkas, had previously worked in verification operations at Wise. Three years after launch, Estonian VCs named Veriff Startup of the Year 2018.\nPrague\nPrague is becoming one of the best places to start up or scale your business in Central and Eastern Europe. “Prague and other cities, such as Brno, are not only fantastic places to live in, but the overall startup ecosystem is picking up in terms of its overall maturity, access to smart angel, VC and PE capital along various verticals, meaningful connections to corporations and other actors of importance, an emerging community of founders and dedicated accelerators, and a quality pool of human capital,” says Petr Vítek, the cofounder of Impact Hub Prague, which is a Google for Startups partner. “It is great to see these developments materialize not only in unicorns such as Rohlik or ProductBoard, but also other awesome startups—which we will hear a lot about soon!”\nFor more information about Google for Startups\u0027 offering, visit startup.google.com\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","tags":["","BRAND LAB","PROMOTION","GOOGLE"],"creation_date":"2022-10-06"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/cryptocurrency-cybercrime-law-enforcement/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Local law enforcement isn’t ready to deal with this new type of fraud, even with shady scams on the rise.","title":"Are You a Victim of Crypto Crime?

The crypto research and developer community would agree on what a change looks like, coders would type out a command and time-stamp it, developers on the client side would download these bits of code, and then at the predetermined time, the system would manifest the change by itself—in this case, the Merge. It changed how transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are verified, a much-delayed upgrade that has been hailed as a major moment in crypto land.\nThat doesn’t make the current landscape of crypto apps, and the blockchain technology they’re built on, any less complex for the average individual. Buterin seems mostly aware of this. In the lead-up to the Merge, he collated some of his earlier essays about crypto into a book titled Proof of Stake: The Making of Ethereum and the Philosophy of Blockchains. Given how quickly crypto technologies are changing, the book already feels slightly outdated, peppered with coins and DAOs that may no longer exist and concluding in an essay from January 2022, just before the crypto market tanked. But the collection serves as a kind of crypto Old Testament, a historical record and first-hand account of a mind-shift toward decentralized networks that inspire a host of lofty promises.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nWIRED’s global editorial director, Gideon Lichfield, and senior writer Lauren Goode spoke with Buterin over Zoom about the recently burst crypto bubble, whether decentralized technology can support society-scale decisionmaking, and what next great innovation may follow the Merge. The conversation has been edited and condensed.\nGideon Lichfield: So I guess congratulations are due on the Merge. How do you feel it has gone?\nVitalik Buterin: I\u0027m definitely happy, and definitely relieved. This is a transition that the whole Ethereum community has been working towards for the last eight years. Along the way there have been a lot of people—whether from the Bitcoin community, or people skeptical of crypto in general—who have doubted whether or not the Merge, this switch to proof of stake, would happen. We\u0027re very happy to have proven all of them wrong finally.\nThe WIRED Guide to the Blockchain\nThe idea of creating tamper-proof databases has captured the attention of everyone from anarchist techies to staid bankers.\nBY WIRED STAFF\nGL: Just to boil things down really simply, the presumed advantages of proof of stake are that it uses much less energy and has lower barriers to entry, so there\u0027s less risk of centralization. It\u0027s more secure against attacks. But what would you say, in lay terms, are the biggest opportunities that proof of stake opens up?\nI think there are a few. One of them is from the economic resources that the ecosystem no longer has to spend on proof of work. All kinds of projects are going to have somewhat more resources than they did before.Another is the greater legitimacy the switch to proof of stake gives to Ethereum. A lot of institutional actors, whether it\u0027s governments or corporations, their biggest reason to be skeptical of or not want to use Ethereum has been the proof of work and environmental aspect. After the Merge, Ethereum is not a proof of work network anymore, and that makes people who had those kinds of concerns a lot more willing to use it now. There’s probably going to be a lot of people who have been quietly on the sidelines who now are going to come in and start using Ethereum.\nA third one is that proof of stake is an opportunity to redesign the protocol in a lot of ways. Probably the biggest problem that people have with blockchains—outside of proof of stake or their practical ability to use them—is scalability. Sending transactions is expensive, because blockchains are not very scalable. The reason why is this architecture where every node in the network has to personally verify every single transaction. We have ideas around technologies to fix that and turn Ethereum into a system that processes transactions in a way that\u0027s still decentralized, but a lot more efficient.\nLauren Goode: You sort of answered my next question, which is, what is the next biggest innovation we can look for post-Merge? Can you give a specific example of developers building something that they weren\u0027t able to build, or build efficiently, before?\nScaling is really the big one. Ethereum has what we call this two-layer scaling model, and the plan is to upgrade it a little bit, by making it possible for the chain to process a much larger amount of data. And then there are these separate protocols that take that data as an ingredient and create kind of like mini-Ethereums inside of Ethereum, on top of that. These together would be able to process a much larger number of transactions. Instead of the roughly 20 transactions per second that Ethereum can process today, potentially between 5,000 and a 100,000 transactions.\nA bunch of work needs to happen in the Ethereum ecosystem on building these layer-two protocols. And the Merge makes it much easier. The transition to scalability is probably the next big thing that the Ethereum ecosystem is doing after the Merge. It\u0027s, in my opinion, equally exciting. It could be equally as big of a game changer.\nGL: How do you think the crypto crash of this year affects Ethereum now, in the wake of the Merge?\nMmm, it\u0027s a good question. I have, I think, said publicly on a couple of occasions that to some extent I look forward to the bear market. One of the unfortunate things that\u0027s happened around crypto, especially in the 2020 and 2021 bubble, is that it got big before it was really mature enough to handle the level of attention it was getting. If you look at the chart of how much energy Ethereum consumed, I think more than half, maybe more than two-thirds, was within the last two years. If the Merge had happened two years earlier, things would be even better, and if it got delayed by another five years and it happened after another really big crypto bubble, things could have been vastly worse.That’s also true from the scalability point of view. Transaction fees on Ethereum got up to $5 and even $20 [per transaction] last year, and if there is another big price bubble we could easily see fees go up to $100 or $200. In that kind of a world, talking about the promise of crypto as a way of empowering the third world, banking the unbanked, supporting people who are marginalized by existing institutions, just clearly starts looking ridiculous.\nI\u0027ve always really wanted to solve scalability properly before the next big rise in adoption and attention on the ecosystem happens. One of the saving graces of prices going down for a while is that we are going to get an opportunity to be able to do that. Proof of stake does not reduce transaction fees, but it is the big thing that we\u0027ve had to get out of the way before we can go full steam ahead on doing the stuff that will.\nLG: Your last essay in the book, written in January 2022, is about NFTs. Since then the market has changed dramatically. How confident are you in some of the ideas that you were exploring, like the “Proof of Attendance Protocol”? For what it’s worth, event ticketing seemed to be one of the more valid uses of NFTs. But the market for NFT art has just cratered.\nMy take on NFTs is the same as it was a year ago, which is that I think the NFTs that are going to be sustainable are the NFTs that are going to be useful. In the beginning stages, there is tradable art and cat pictures, and a lot of that stuff really has cratered. For an NFT to have lasting value there needs to be some benefit of holding it other than just being able to say that you hold it.\nThe most successful NFT use case so far, and it\u0027s been so successful and pervasive that people don\u0027t even think about it as NFTs, is ENS domain names. I\u0027m sure last year you saw a lot of people on Twitter putting up dot-ETH names. I still have Vitalik.ETH. Those names are NFTs that are in the wallet of a particular address. If you have that NFT, then if I want to send someone Ether, or interact with them through some Ethereum application, then I can put in their dot-ETH name. It’s really convenient to do that—the same sort of function that domain names on the internet or usernames have in any kind of chat application—except in this big decentralized Ethereum ecosystem.\nAnother interesting use is the whole NFT gaming space. Games like Axie Infinity were really successful last year, but then Axie Infinity got hacked. Even aside from that, it hasn\u0027t really been able to recover. The reason for that in my view is that the people who designed these first-generation NFT games approached it with the attitude that the financialization aspect by itself was enough to make the game fun. But that’s clearly not enough, and a successful NFT or play-to-earn game itself needs to be fun even without the monetization aspect. Whoever figures out how to make a blockchain game that is a fun game first, those are the kinds of projects that are going to win.","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","MONEY","REGULATION","ENCRYPTION"],"author":"BY LAUREN GOODE","creation_date":"2022-09-26"},{"article_link":"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-bogus-fears-of-censorship-could-spell-the-end-of-content-moderation/","website_source":"Wired","article_type":"News Article","summary":"Plus: The Supreme Court in cyberspace, what’s up with Web3, and ghost town resurrections.","title":"Bogus Fears of Censorship Could Spell the End of Content Moderation","detailed_content":"HI, EVERYONE.

It employs the Ouroboros algorithm to achieve consensus on the state of the ledger.\n\n3. Networking Layer - The Networking Layer connects nodes in the network, facilitating the propagation of transactions and blocks. It ensures that data is distributed efficiently across the global Cardano network.\n\n4. Scripting Layer - The Scripting Layer sits at the top and supports smart contracts.
