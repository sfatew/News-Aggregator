[{"date":"03.27.2024","summary":"A jury convicted Roman Sterlingov of money laundering this month. His defense team says it will appeal, saying the crypto-tracing technique at the heart of the case is \u201Cpseudoscience.\u201D","post_content":"On March 12, Russian-Swedish national Roman Sterlingov was found guilty of money laundering conspiracy and other violations by a federal jury in Washington, DC, for having operated Bitcoin Fog, a service criminals used to launder what authorities claim was hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.\nThe conviction was heralded by the US Department of Justice as a victory over crypto-enabled criminality, but Sterlingov\u2019s lawyers maintain the case against him was flawed and plan to appeal. They allege that the nascent science used to collect evidence against him is not fit for the purpose.\nThe DOJ investigation used blockchain forensics, a technique whereby investigators scrutinize the public trail of crypto transactions to map the flow of funds. In a statement, Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general for the US, described the DOJ as \u201Cpainstakingly tracing bitcoin through the blockchain\u201D to identify Sterlingov as the pseudonymous administrator behind Bitcoin Fog.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acquired an undeserved reputation for being less traceable than conventional money, but evidence collected this way has brought down many criminals over the past decade. Blockchain forensics was crucial to the trial of Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous Silk Road marketplace. But in the Bitcoin Fog case, the defense has pulled this investigative technique into the spotlight, effectively putting crypto tracing on trial in place of their client. The case is a \u201Cfirst-of-its-kind,\u201D says Tor Ekeland, legal counsel to Sterlingov. \u201CNobody has challenged blockchain forensics before, because it\u2019s brand-new.\u201D\nBefore Sterlingov\u2019s trial, his attorneys asked the presiding judge to determine the admissibility of evidence from blockchain forensics experts that had used software from a firm called Chainalysis, which expedites the otherwise tedious process of sifting through the blockchain. He ruled the evidence was admissible.\nThat decision has been characterized by Michael Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, as an endorsement of his firm and its methods. \u201CWe are now the only company in the world with a stamp of approval for our ability to look at a blockchain and create evidence,\u201D he says. But Ekeland says he will work with Sterlingov to appeal both the guilty verdict and the judge\u2019s ruling on the validity of blockchain forensics. The conviction of Sterlingov is the latest example of the unhappy phenomenon, claims Ekeland, whereby \u201Cnewly emergent junk science leads to unjust verdicts.\u201D\nBeth Bisbee of Chainalysis, formerly the company\u2019s head of US investigations, disputes that characterization. \u201CThe evidence that the government presented to the jury demonstrated the exact opposite,\u201D says Bisbee, who testified as an expert witness at the trial. \u201COur methods are transparent, tested, reviewed, and reliable.\u201D\nNatsec Threat\nUntil it was shut down by US law enforcement in 2021, Bitcoin Fog supplied what's known as a crypto mixing or crypto tumbling service. Funds belonging to many parties are pooled, jumbled up, and spat out into brand-new wallets, masking the origin of the coins held in each. Mixers were originally promoted as a way to improve the level of privacy cryptocurrency could afford consumers, but they have been readily co-opted for the purpose of money laundering. Bitcoin Fog was among the first mixers to emerge, in 2011, making it \u201Cthe longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet,\u201D the DOJ says.\nIn the past few years, the US government has cracked down on crypto mixers, which it considers a threat to national security. After taking down Bitcoin Fog, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, another mixer, in 2022. The year after, it took down another, ChipMixer, and charged the founder with money laundering. To identify the individuals behind these operations, investigators had to follow the crypto money.In crypto\u2019s earliest years, the pseudonymous nature of transactions\u2014whereby coins are exchanged between wallets identified only by an alphanumeric address\u2014was frequently mistaken for anonymity. But beginning in late 2012 with the work of cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn, now a professor at University College London, among others, researchers began to figure out ways to group crypto wallets together, revealing connections that implied shared ownership. \u201CUltimately, you\u2019re trying to link one pile of money to another,\u201D says Meiklejohn. With this new knowledge, it became possible to attribute wallets to specific crypto exchanges or marketplaces, and to follow stolen funds. To identify the people who owned particular wallets, law enforcement could subpoena the exchanges they used to convert crypto into regular money. Logged on an open ledger for all to see, crypto transactions were not remotely anonymous.\nThis general methodology\u2014which Meiklejohn termed \u201Cclustering\u201D\u2014was taken up, further developed, and packaged into blockchain forensics services offered by firms like Chainalysis, which was used by the DOJ to help prosecute Sterlingov. \u201CIn academia, we are pretty far behind the state of the art at this point,\u201D says Meiklejohn. \u201CWe sort of accept that this is just an industry now.\u201D\nThe professionalization of blockchain forensics is central to Sterlingov\u2019s defense strategy in the Bitcoin Fog case. It is impossible to audit the clustering performed by the government for accuracy, a report commissioned by the defense submitted ahead of the trial claimed, because the inner workings of Chainalysis\u2019 software are private. There has been no peer review of the specific methodology the company uses, says Ekeland, nor is there any standards body for the blockchain forensics industry. \u201CIt should be illegal to use black box software in criminal prosecutions\u2014it should be open source. It violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront their accuser. It\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201D he claims. Chainalysis says the hearings on the admissibility of the company\u2019s evidence served as a check on its reliability.\n\u201CMushrooming Effect\u201D\nThe defense also disputes the way in which blockchain forensics evidence was interpreted, to finger Sterlingov as the operator of Bitcoin Fog. Although wallets belonging to Sterlingov might have interacted with the mixer, that does not prove him the service\u2019s operator, they argue. \u201CThe problem isn\u2019t so much that the blockchain is lying,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CThe flow of funds is not the same as the flow of control.\u201D\nWhile the government presented other forms of evidence it said tied Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog, like analysis of IP addresses linking him to the ownership of the web domain, Ekeland believes the blockchain forensics was critical in convincing the jury of his guilt. \u201CThe \u2018CSI effect\u2019 really hurt us,\u201D he says. \u201CThe jury placed undue importance on pseudoscientific evidence, because it was presented in a fancy chart and by the government.\u201D\nThe academics with whom the science of crypto tracing originated acknowledge that it should not be applied as evidence in isolation, or mischaracterized as some sort of a smoking gun. There remains some art to interpreting the information produced by blockchain analysis, says Meiklejohn, which introduces the opportunity for error. \u201CYou still have to decide if it means what you think it means, or whether there are other explanations,\u201D she says.\u201CI would not be comfortable [with blockchain forensics being the only form of evidence],\u201D says Philip Koshy, who alongside his wife Diana Koshy demonstrated in 2014 a way to identify the IP addresses associated with certain bitcoin transactions. \u201CIt ends up becoming scientific only if you can determine ground truth, using subpoena power.\u201D\nThe judge in the Sterlingov case pointed out in his ruling on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence that the DOJ had additional evidence pointing to the accused. \u201CThis is not a case in which the government\u2019s theory that Sterlingov was the operator of Bitcoin Fog turns exclusively, or even primarily, [on blockchain forensics],\u201D he wrote. In order to \u201Cestablish that crucial point,\u201D the judge noted, the government relied upon a range of information external to any blockchain, from IP addresses to forum posts.\nThe judge also took issue with the depiction of Chainalysis software as an inscrutable black box, on the grounds that the defense had been given information about its workings\u2014Ekeland disputes this characterization\u2014and pointed out that the underlying heuristics applied by the firm have been subject to peer review, even if its specific clustering methods have not been.\nFor maximum transparency, Chainalysis could open-source its software, but doing so would risk handing an advantage to bad actors. \u201CThis is a cat and mouse game,\u201D says Mieklejohn. \u201COnce you publish the heuristics, people understand how they work, and then they can take steps to evade those heuristics.\u201D In the circumstances, argues Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, the hearings on admissibility\u2014during which the company\u2019s work came under heavy scrutiny\u2014is the next best thing to a traditional peer review.\nIn the end, the effort to cast doubt over the reliability of blockchain forensics bore no fruit for the defense. \u201CThe Court is persuaded that blockchain analytics in general, and [Chainalysis\u2019 software] in particular, is not junk science,\u201D wrote the judge, in his summation on the admissibility question.\nThe ruling does not set a precedent that other US judges must follow, because the case has been confined so far to a district court. Nonetheless, Gronager is hopeful it will be the \u201Cfinal word\u201D on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence, at least until future developments in crypto tracing demand a reevaluation. \u201CThis is a landmark ruling,\u201D adds Bisbee of Chainalysis.\nWhile Ekeland is concerned about a \u201Cmushrooming effect,\u201D whereby the ruling will figure in the thinking of future judges, he claims the matter \u201Ccould take years to gel one way or the other.\u201D Among other quarrels with the way the case was tried, the use of blockchain forensic evidence will form part of the basis for Sterlingov\u2019s appeal. \u201CRight now, the momentum is in their favor,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CBut it\u2019s still an open battlefield.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6603759fd3a75d0aa76d16ab\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_tracing_forensics_trial.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"The Science of Crypto Forensics Survives a Court Battle\u2014for Now","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-science-of-crypto-forensics-court-battle\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRYPTOCURRENCIES","CRIME","DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE","MONEY","FINANCE"]},{"date":"01.26.2024","summary":"In his new book Read Write Own, investor Chris Dixon mounts a defense of blockchain, arguing it can save society from the monopoly power of tech giants.","post_content":"A survey of headlines from the past couple of years in the cryptocurrency industry might lead anyone to believe that it is a deeply unserious business.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65b31346997eb849e52195f0\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_blockchain_save_future.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A Last-Ditch Plan to Save the Crypto Industry","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/a-last-ditch-plan-to-save-the-crypto-industry\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","INVESTING","VENTURE CAPITAL","FTX TRIAL","INTERNET CULTURE","ANTITRUST"]},{"date":"05.01.2024","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model\u2014and the 200-million-transaction dataset it's trained on\u2014that aims to spot the \u201Cshape\u201D of bitcoin money laundering.","post_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can't see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

Now, a dispute within the criminal underground has revealed a new development in that unfolding debacle: One of the partners of the hackers behind the attack points out that those hackers, a group known as AlphV or BlackCat, received a $22 million transaction that looks very much like a large ransom payment.\nOn March 1, a Bitcoin address connected to AlphV received 350 bitcoins in a single transaction, or close to $22 million based on exchange rates at the time. Then, two days later, someone describing themselves as an affiliate of AlphV\u2014one of the hackers who work with the group to penetrate victim networks\u2014posted to the cybercriminal underground forum RAMP that AlphV had cheated them out of their share of the Change Healthcare ransom, pointing to the publicly visible $22 million transaction on Bitcoin's blockchain as proof.\nThey Cracked the Code to a Locked USB Drive Worth $235 Million in Bitcoin. Then It Got Weird\nStefan Thomas lost the password to an encrypted USB drive holding 7,002 bitcoins. One team of hackers believes they can unlock it\u2014if they can get Thomas to let them.\nBY ANDY GREENBERG\nThat suggests, according to Dmitry Smilyanets, the researcher for security firm Recorded Future who first spotted the post, that Change Healthcare has likely paid AlphV's ransom. \u201CYou can see the number of coins that landed there. You don\u2019t see that kind of transaction so often,\u201D Smilyanets says. \u201CThere\u2019s proof of a large amount landing in the AlphV-controlled Bitcoin wallet. And this affiliate connects this address to the attack on Change Healthcare. So it\u2019s likely that the victim paid the ransom.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nJavier Bardem Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions\nA spokesperson for Change Healthcare, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group, declined to answer whether it had paid a ransom to AlphV, telling WIRED only that \u201Cwe are focused on the investigation right now.\u201D\nBoth Recorded Future and TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm, connect the Bitcoin address that received the $22 million payment to the AlphV hackers. TRM Labs says it can link the address to payments from two other AlphV victims in January.\nIf Change Healthcare did pay a $22 million ransom, it would not only represent a huge payday for AlphV, but also a dangerous precedent for the health care industry, argues Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused researcher with security firm Emsisoft. Every ransomware payment, he says, both funds future attacks by the group responsible and suggests to other ransomware predators that they should try the same playbook\u2014in this case, attacking health care services that patients depend on.\n\u201CIf Change did pay, it's problematic,\u201D says Callow. \u201CIt highlights the profitability of attacks on the health care sector. Ransomware gangs are nothing if not predictable: If they find a particular sector to be lucrative, they\u2019ll attack it over and over again, rinse and repeat.\u201D\nThe self-described AlphV affiliate who first posted evidence of the payment on RAMP, and who goes by the name \u201Cnotchy,\u201D complained that AlphV had apparently collected the $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare and then kept the entire sum, rather than share the profits with their hacking partner as they had allegedly agreed. \u201CBe careful everyone and stop deal with ALPHV,\" notchy wrote.That affiliate hacker also wrote that in their penetration of Change Healthcare's network, they had accessed the data of numerous other health care firms partnered with the company. If that claim is accurate, Recorded Future's Smilyanets points out, it creates the additional risk that the affiliate hacker still possesses sensitive medical information. Even if Change Healthcare did pay AlphV, the hacker affiliate could still demand additional payment or leak the data independently.\n\u201CThe affiliates still have this data, and they\u2019re mad they didn\u2019t receive this money,\u201D says Smilyanets. \u201CIt\u2019s a good lesson for everyone. You cannot trust criminals; their word is worth nothing.\u201D\nAs ransomware payments go, $22 million would represent a remarkably profitable score for AlphV. Only a relatively small number of ransoms in the history of ransomware, such as the $40 million payment made by the financial firm CNA to the hackers known as Evil Corp, have been so large, says Emsisoft's Callow. \u201CIt\u2019s not without precedent, but it\u2019s certainly very unusual,\u201D he says.\nRegardless of whether Change Healthcare is confirmed to have paid that ransom, the attack shows that AlphV has pulled off a disturbing comeback: In December, it was the target of an FBI operation that seized its dark web sites and released decryption keys that foiled its attacks on hundreds of victims. Just two months later, it carried out the cyberattack that paralyzed Change Healthcare, triggering an outage whose effects on pharmacies and their patients have now stretched well beyond a week. As of last Tuesday, AlphV listed 28 companies on the dark web site it uses to extort its victims, not including Change Healthcare.\nThat site has now gone offline. As of Tuesday morning, it displayed what appeared to be a law enforcement seizure notice, but security researcher Fabian Wosar points out that the notice seems to have been copied from AlphV's last takedown. The reason for the group's disappearance\u2014whether due to another law enforcement operation or AlphV's attempts to dodge its own cheated affiliates\u2014is unclear. Ransomware trackers say AlphV has disappeared and rebranded several times before. Earlier incarnations under the name BlackCat, BlackMatter, and Darkside were all more or less the same group, security researchers note.\nIn fact, the hackers working under that Darkside handle were responsible for the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that triggered the shutdown of gas transportation across the Eastern Seaboard of the US and resulted in a brief fuel shortage in some East Coast cities. In that case, too, the victims paid the hackers' ransom. \u201CIt was the hardest decision I've made,\u201D Colonial's CEO Joseph Blount later told a US congressional hearing.\nNow, it seems, some of the same hackers may have forced yet another company to make that same hard decision.\nUpdate 3\/4\/2024, 1:50 pm EST: Included additional contextual details about AlphV and related ransomware attacks.\nUpdated 3\/5\/2024, 10:30 am EST to note that AlphV's dark web site now displays what appears to be a law enforcement takedown message.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65e5f048505aa2df678569bd\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Change-Healthcare-Pays-Ransom-Security-Alamy-BNWJJ3.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Hackers Behind the Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack Just Received a $22 Million Payment","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/alphv-change-healthcare-ransomware-payment\/","tags":["","RANSOMWARE","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME","HEALTHCARE"]},{"date":"02.01.2024","summary":"An indictment against three Americans suggests that at least some of the culprits behind the theft of an FTX crypto fortune may be in custody.","post_content":"When more than $400 million worth of crypto was mysteriously pulled out of the coffers of what was once the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, on the very day that it declared bankruptcy in November of 2022, many initially suspected insiders at the company\u2014including, potentially, then CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, now convicted of fraud.

That discovery would upend the world of cybercrime. Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world\u2019s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web\u2019s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nThat 180-degree flip in the world\u2019s understanding of cryptocurrency\u2019s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn\u2019s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer\u2019s mining power to 11 different mining \u201Cpools,\u201D groups that collected users\u2019 computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\nPHOTOGRAPH: PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nWalmart\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\nMeiklejohn\u2019s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists\u2019 idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous.\nA collage from Meiklejohn\u2019s research paper showing every object she bought with Bitcoin in her tracing experiments.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNAS MEIKLEJOHN PAINSTAKINGLY fiddled with bitcoins and watched the digital trails they created, she found herself having flashbacks to a particular day, decades earlier, in her mother\u2019s downtown Manhattan office. That morning, Meiklejohn and her mother had taken the subway together, all the way from their Upper West Side apartment near the American Museum of Natural History to the federal building at Foley Square, across from the city\u2019s intimidating, stone-columned courthouses.\nMeiklejohn was still in elementary school, but it was take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Meiklejohn\u2019s mother was a federal prosecutor. Over the years that followed, the elder Meiklejohn would make her career taking on contractors who were bilking the city government out of tax dollars\u2014bribing government staffers to choose overpriced school food or street-paving services\u2014or else banks colluding to sell low-performing investments to the city\u2019s financiers. Many of her targets in those corruption probes would be sentenced to years in prison.\nThat day in the Justice Department\u2019s New York office, Sarah Meiklejohn, not yet 10 years old, was put to work. She was assigned to comb through a pile of paper checks, searching for clues of a corrupt kickback scheme in one of her mother\u2019s investigations.\nIt was that feeling, the drive to manually assemble tiny data points that built into a larger picture, that would give Meiklejohn a kind of déjà vu 20 years later as she studied the Bitcoin blockchain, even before she consciously knew what she was doing.\n\u201CSomewhere in the back of my mind was this idea,\u201D says Meiklejohn, \u201Cthe idea of following the money.\u201D\nAs a child, Meiklejohn loved puzzles\u2014the more complex, the better. On road trips, in airports, or any other time the small-for-her-age, hyper-inquisitive girl needed to be distracted, her mother would hand her a book of puzzles. One of the first websites Meiklejohn remembers visiting on the nascent World Wide Web was a GeoCities page devoted to deciphering the Kryptos sculpture on the campus of the CIA, whose copper, ribbonlike surface contained four coded messages that even the cryptanalysts at Langley hadn\u2019t been able to crack. By the age of 14 she would finish the New York Times crossword puzzle every day of the week.\nOn a vacation to London, Meiklejohn\u2019s family visited the British Museum, and Meiklejohn became fixated on the Rosetta stone, along with the broader notion of ancient languages\u2014the remnants of entire cultures\u2014that could be deciphered if the puzzler simply found the right key. Soon she was reading about Linear A and Linear B, a pair of written scripts used by the Minoan civilization on Crete until roughly 1500 BC. Linear B had been deciphered only in the 1950s, thanks in large part to a classicist at Brooklyn College named Alice Kober who labored in obscurity over samples of the Bronze Age language for 20 years, writing her notes on 180,000 index cards.\nMeiklejohn became so obsessed with Linear A and B that she persuaded a teacher at her middle school to organize an evening seminar on the subject (only she and one friend attended). More tantalizing than even the story of Alice Kober\u2019s work on Linear B, for Meiklejohn, was the fact that no one had been able to decipher Linear A, even after a century of study. The best puzzles of all were the ones that had no answer key\u2014the ones for which no one even knew if a solution existed.When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201Cunbreakable\u201D system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\nMEIKLEJOHN SHOWED REAL talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.Considering Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics for the first time, Meiklejohn was intrigued. But when she got home from the hike and began poring over Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper, it immediately became clear to her that Bitcoin\u2019s trade-offs were the exact opposite of the eCash system she knew so well. Fraud was prevented not by a kind of after-the-fact forgery analysis carried out by a bank authority but with an instantaneous check of the blockchain, the unforgeable public record of who possessed every single bitcoin.\nBut that blockchain ledger system came at an enormous privacy cost: In Bitcoin, for good and for ill, everyone was a witness to every payment. Yes, identities behind those payments were obscured by pseudonymous addresses, long strings of between 26 and 35 characters. But to Meiklejohn, this seemed like an inherently dangerous sort of fig leaf to hide behind. Unlike eCash, whose privacy protections offered snoops no hint of revealing information to latch onto, Bitcoin offered an enormous collection of data to analyze. Who could say what sorts of patterns might give away users who thought they were cleverer than those watching them?\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CAnd so as a cryptographer, the natural question was, if you can\u2019t prove it\u2019s private, then what attacks are possible? If you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nThe temptation was more than Meiklejohn could resist. The blockchain, like a massive, undeciphered corpus of an ancient language, hid a wealth of secrets in plain view.\nWHEN MEIKLEJOHN BEGAN digging into the blockchain in late 2012, she started with a very simple question: How many people were using bitcoin?\nThat number was much harder to pin down than it might seem. After downloading the entire blockchain onto a UCSD server and organizing it into a database that she could query, like a gargantuan, searchable spreadsheet, she could see that there were more than 12 million distinct Bitcoin addresses, among which there had been nearly 16 million transactions. But even amid all that activity, there were plenty of recognizable events in Bitcoin\u2019s history visible to the naked eye. Spenders and recipients might have been hidden behind pseudonymous addresses, but some transactions were unmistakable, like distinctive pieces of furniture hidden under thin sheets in someone\u2019s attic.\nShe could see, for instance, the nearly 1 million bitcoins that were mined by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency, before others started using it, as well as the first transaction ever made when Satoshi sent 10 coins as a test to the early Bitcoin developer Hal Finney in January 2009. She spotted, too, the first payment with real value, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz famously sold a friend two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010 (as of this writing worth hundreds of millions of dollars).\nPlenty of other addresses and transactions had been recognized and widely discussed on forums like Bitcointalk, and Meiklejohn spent hours cutting and pasting long strings of characters into Google to see if someone had already claimed credit for an address or if other Bitcoin users had been gossiping about certain high-value transactions. By the time Meiklejohn began to look, anyone with enough interest and patience to wade through a sea of garbled addresses could see money transfers between mysterious parties just beneath the surface of the blockchain\u2019s obfuscation that, even at the time, were often worth small fortunes.Getting beyond that obfuscation, however, was the real challenge. Sure, Meiklejohn could see transactions between addresses. But the problem was drilling down further, definitively drawing a boundary around the bitcoin hoard of any single person or organization. A user could have as many addresses as they chose to create with one of the many wallet programs that managed their coins\u2014like a bank that allows you to spread your wealth across as many accounts as you liked, creating new ones with a mouse click. Plenty of those programs even automatically generated new addresses every time the user received a bitcoin payment, adding to the confusion.\nStill, Meiklejohn was sure that searching for patterns in the mess of transactions would allow her to untangle at least some of them. In Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s own original white paper, Meiklejohn recalled that he had briefly alluded to a technique that could be used to collapse some addresses into single identities. Often, a single bitcoin transaction has multiple \u201Cinputs\u201D from different addresses. If someone wants to pay a friend 10 bitcoins but holds those coins at two different addresses of five coins each, the spender\u2019s wallet software creates a single transaction that lists the two five-coin addresses as inputs and the address receiving 10 coins as the output. To make the payment possible, the payer would need to possess both of the so-called secret keys that allow the five coins at each address to be spent. That means anyone looking at the transaction on the blockchain can reasonably identify both of the input addresses as belonging to the same person or organization.\nSatoshi had hinted at the privacy dangers this introduced. \u201CSome linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,\u201D Satoshi wrote. \u201CThe risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.\u201D\nSo, as Meiklejohn\u2019s first step, she simply tried the technique Satoshi had inadvertently suggested\u2014across every bitcoin payment ever carried out. She scanned her blockchain database for every multi-input transaction, linking all of those double, triple, or even hundredfold inputs to single identities. The result immediately reduced the number of potential Bitcoin users from 12 million to date to around 5 million, slicing away more than half of the problem.\nMeiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked.\nOnly after that initial step\u2014practically a freebie\u2014did Meiklejohn switch her brain into true puzzle-solving mode. Like a 20th-century archaeologist scanning hieroglyphics for identifiable words or phrases that might help to decipher a passage of text, she began to hunt through Bitcoin\u2019s transactions for other clues that might reveal identifying information. Messing around with bitcoin wallets\u2014making test payments to herself and her colleagues\u2014she began to understand a quirk of the cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin wallets only allowed spenders to pay the entire amount of coins sitting at a certain address. Each address was like a piggy bank that has to be smashed open to spend the coins inside. Spend less than the whole amount in that piggy bank and the leftovers have to be stored in a newly created piggy bank.\nThis second piggy bank, in Bitcoin\u2019s system, is called a \u201Cchange\u201D address: When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient\u2019s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn\u2019t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address\u2014a piggy bank that had materialized on the spot to receive leftover coins from the one that had just been shattered. And that meant these two piggy banks\u2014the spender\u2019s address and the change address\u2014must belong to the same person.\nMeiklejohn began to apply that change-making lens, looking for instances where she could link spenders and the remainders of their payments. She began to see how powerful the simple act of tracking bitcoin change could be: In instances where she couldn\u2019t distinguish a recipient address from a change address, she would be stuck at a fork in the road with no signposts. But if she could link change addresses to the addresses they had split off from, she could make her own signposts. She could follow the money despite its branching paths.\nThe result was that Meiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked: A single sum of coins would move from change address to change address as the spender paid fractions of the total pile of coins in one small payment after another. The remainder of the pile might move to a fresh address with each payment, but those addresses must all represent the transactions of a single spender.\nShe\u2019d come to refer to those chains of transactions as \u201Cpeeling chains\u201D (or sometimes just \u201Cpeel chains\u201D). She thought of them like someone peeling bills off a roll of dollar bills: Though the roll of bills might be put back in a different pocket after a bill was peeled off and spent, it was still fundamentally one wad of cash with a consistent owner. Following these peeling chains opened avenues to trace the digital money\u2019s movements like never before.\nMeiklejohn now had two clever techniques, both of which were capable of linking multiple Bitcoin addresses to a single person or organization, what she came to call \u201Cclustering.\u201D What had initially looked like disparate addresses could now be connected into clusters that encompassed hundreds or, in some cases, even thousands of addresses.\nAlready, she was tracing bitcoins in ways that many of the cryptocurrency\u2019s users wouldn\u2019t have believed possible. But following coins didn\u2019t necessarily mean understanding who owned them. The identities behind those coins remained a mystery, and each of her clusters remained just as pseudonymous as the single, disconnected addresses had been originally. To put a name to those clusters, she began to realize, she\u2019d have to take a much more hands-on approach: not simply observing the artifacts of the Bitcoin economy after the fact like an archaeologist, but becoming a player in it herself\u2014in some cases, an undercover one.\nSEARCHING FOR GUIDANCE in her budding Bitcoin research, Meiklejohn turned to Stefan Savage, a UCSD professor who was on the other end of the spectrum from the deeply mathematical cryptography research Meiklejohn had spent years on. Savage was a hands-on, empirical researcher, more interested in real-world experiments with real-world results than abstractions. He had been one of the lead advisers of a now-legendary team of researchers who had first shown it was possible to hack a car over the internet, demonstrating to General Motors in 2011 that his team could remotely take over a Chevy Impala\u2019s steering and brakes via the cellular radio in its OnStar system, a shocking feat of hacker wizardry.More recently, Savage had helped lead a group that included Kirill Levchenko\u2014the scientist who\u2019d introduced Meiklejohn to Bitcoin on their desert hike\u2014working on a massively ambitious project to track the spam email ecosystem. In that research, as with the earlier car-hacking breakthrough, Savage\u2019s team hadn\u2019t been afraid to get their hands dirty: They\u2019d collected hundreds of millions of web links in junk marketing emails, mostly ones intended to sell real and fake pharmaceuticals. Then, as Savage describes it, they acted out the role of \u201Cthe world\u2019s most gullible person,\u201D using bots to click through on every one of those links to see where they led and spending more than $50,000 on the products the spammers were hawking\u2014all while working with a cooperative credit card issuer to trace the funds and see which banks ended up with the money.\nSeveral of those shady banks were ultimately shut down as a result of the researchers\u2019 tracing work. As another UCSD professor working on the project, Geoffrey Voelker, described it at the time, \u201COur secret weapon is shopping.\u201D\nSo when Meiklejohn began talking over her Bitcoin tracking project with Savage, the two agreed she should take the same approach: She would manually identify Bitcoin addresses one by one by doing transactions with them herself, like a cop on the narcotics beat carrying out buy-and-busts.\nThat\u2019s how Meiklejohn found herself in the early weeks of 2013 ordering coffee, cupcakes, trading cards, mugs, baseball hats, silver coins, socks, and a closet\u2019s worth of other truly random objects from online vendors who accepted bitcoin; joining more than a dozen mining collectives; fiendishly gambling bitcoins at every online crypto casino she could find; and moving bitcoins into and out of accounts on practically every existing bitcoin exchange\u2014and the Silk Road\u2014again and again.\nThe hundreds of addresses Meiklejohn identified and tagged manually with those 344 transactions represented only the tiniest fraction of the overall bitcoin landscape. But when she combined her address tagging with her chaining and clustering techniques, many of those tags suddenly identified not just a single address but an enormous cluster belonging to the same owner. With just a few hundred tags, she had put an identity to more than a million of Bitcoin\u2019s once-pseudonymous addresses.\nA chart from Meiklejohn\u2019s paper showing her \u201Cclustering\u201D of Bitcoin addresses for early cryptocurrency entities.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNWith just the 30 addresses she had identified by moving coins into and out of Mt. Gox, for instance, she could now link more than 500,000 addresses to the exchange. And based on just four deposits and seven withdrawals into wallets on the Silk Road, she was able to identify nearly 300,000 of the black market\u2019s addresses. This breakthrough didn\u2019t mean Meiklejohn could identify any actual users of the Silk Road by name, nor could she unmask, of course, the mysterious kingpin of that site, the ultra libertarian Dread Pirate Roberts. But it would directly contradict DPR\u2019s claims to me that his Bitcoin \u201Ctumbler\u201D system could prevent observers from even seeing when users moved cryptocurrency into and out of their Silk Road accounts.\nWhen Meiklejohn brought her results back to Savage, her adviser was impressed. But as they began to plan to publish a paper on her findings, he wanted a concrete demonstration for readers, not a bunch of arcane statistics. \u201CWe need to show people,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers him saying, \u201Cwhat these techniques can actually do.\u201D\nSo Meiklejohn went a step further: She began to look for specific bitcoin transactions she could track\u2014particularly criminal ones.\nAS MEIKLEJOHN HAD trawled cryptocurrency forums for discussions of interesting addresses worth scrutinizing, one mysterious mountain of money in particular stood out: This single address had, over the course of 2012, accumulated 613,326 bitcoins\u20145 percent of all the coins in circulation. It represented around $7.5 million at the time, a figure nowhere near the billions it would represent today, but a heady sum nonetheless. Rumors among Bitcoin users suggested that the hoard was possibly a Silk Road wallet, or perhaps the result of an unrelated, notorious Bitcoin Ponzi scheme carried out by a user known as pirate@40.\nMeiklejohn couldn\u2019t say which of the two rumors might be correct. But with her clustering techniques, she could now follow that giant sum of cryptocurrency. She saw that after conspicuously gathering at one address, the pile of money had been broken up in late 2012 and sent on forking paths around the blockchain. Meiklejohn\u2019s understanding of peel chains meant she could now trace those sums of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as they split, distinguishing the amount that remained in the control of the initial owner from the smaller sums that were peeled off in subsequent payments. Eventually, several of those peel chains led to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, where they seemed to be cashed out for traditional currency. For an academic researcher, this was a dead end. But anyone with the subpoena power of law enforcement, Meiklejohn realized, could very likely force those exchanges to hand over information about the accounts behind those transactions and solve the mystery of the $7.5 million stash.\nFar from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\nLooking for more coins to hunt, Meiklejohn turned her focus to another sort of dirty money. Large-scale cryptocurrency heists were, in early 2013, a growing epidemic. After all, bitcoin was like cash or gold. Anyone who stole a Bitcoin address\u2019s secret key could empty out that address like a digital safe. Unlike with credit cards or other digital payment systems, there was no overseer who could stop or reverse the money\u2019s movement. That had made every bitcoin business and its stash of crypto revenue a ripe target for hackers, especially if the holders of those funds made the mistake of storing their secret keys on internet-connected computers\u2014the equivalent of carrying six- or seven-figure sums of cash in their pockets while strolling through a dangerous neighborhood.\nMeiklejohn found a thread on Bitcointalk that listed addresses of many of the biggest, most conspicuous crypto thefts in recent memory, and she began to follow the money. Looking at a robbery of 3,171 coins from an early bitcoin gambling site, she immediately found she could trace the stolen funds across no fewer than ten hops, from address to address, before different branches of the money were cashed out at exchanges. Another theft of 18,500 bitcoins from the exchange Bitcoinica similarly led her along a winding series of peel chains that ended at three other exchanges, where the robbers were no doubt cashing in their ill-gotten gains. Sitting in front of Meiklejohn, on her screen, was a bonanza of leads, each just waiting for any actual criminal investigator with a handful of subpoenas to follow them.Now, when Meiklejohn showed Savage her results, he agreed: They were ready to publish.\nIn the final draft of the paper Meiklejohn and her coauthors put together, they definitively stated conclusions\u2014based for the first time on solid, empirical evidence\u2014that flew in the face of what many Bitcoin users believed at the time: Far from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\n\u201CEven our relatively small experiment demonstrates that this approach can shed considerable light on the structure of the Bitcoin economy, how it is used, and those organizations who are party to it,\u201D the paper read. \u201CWe demonstrate that an agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the public nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary flows to major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.\u201D\nHaving set down those words, and blowing a gaping hole in the myth of Bitcoin\u2019s inherent untraceability, Meiklejohn, Savage, and her other adviser Geoffrey Voelker started brainstorming a clever title. In an homage to the Wild West of the economy they were chronicling\u2014and her advisers\u2019 mutual love of spaghetti Westerns\u2014they started with the phrase \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins,\u201D an allusion to the 1960s Clint Eastwood classic A Fistful of Dollars. They settled on a subtitle that evoked both Eastwood\u2019s most famous cowboy vigilante and the world of shadowy figures their nascent techniques could unmask. When the UCSD paper hit the internet in August 2013, it was introduced with a description that, to those involved, had come to seem inevitable: \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.\u201D\nIn the new era of cryptocurrency tracing that would follow Meiklejohn\u2019s work, they wouldn\u2019t remain nameless for long.\nAdapted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency.

And yet, it still faces the risk of losing vast amounts of customers' sensitive medical data.\nIn a statement sent to WIRED and other news outlets on Monday evening, Change Healthcare wrote that it paid a ransom to a cybercriminal group extorting the company, a hacker gang known as AlphV or BlackCat. \u201CA ransom was paid as part of the company\u2019s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from disclosure,\u201D the statement reads. The company's belated admission of that payment accompanied a new post on its website where it warns that the hackers may have stolen health-related data that would \u201Ccover a substantial proportion of people in America.\u201D\nChange Healthcare's statement didn't state the size of the ransom payment. In a hearing held by the US Senate's Finance Committee on May 1, however, Andrew Witty, CEO of Change Healthcare parent company UnitedHealth Group, confirmed that the payment was $22 million.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Cybersecurity and cryptocurrency researchers told WIRED last month that Change Healthcare appeared to have paid that ransom on March 1, pointing to a transaction of 350 bitcoins or roughly $22 million sent into a crypto wallet associated with the AlphV hackers. That transaction was first highlighted in a message on a Russian cybercriminal forum known as RAMP, where one of AlphV's allegedly jilted partners complained that they hadn't received their cut of Change Healthcare's payment. However, for weeks following that transaction, which was publicly visible on Bitcoin's blockchain and which both security firm Recorded Future and blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs told WIRED had been received by AlphV, Change Healthcare repeatedly declined to confirm that it had paid the ransom.\nChange Healthcare's confirmation of that extortion payment puts new weight behind the cybersecurity industry's fears that the attack\u2014and the profit AlphV extracted from it\u2014will lead ransomware gangs to further target health care companies. \u201CIt 100 percent encourages other actors to target health care organizations,\u201D Jon DiMaggio, a researcher with cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who focuses on ransomware, told WIRED at the time the transaction was first spotted in March. \u201CAnd it\u2019s one of the industries we don\u2019t want ransomware actors to target\u2014especially when it affects hospitals.\u201D\nCompounding the situation, a conflict between hackers in the ransomware ecosystem has led to a second ransomware group claiming to possess Change Healthcare's stolen data and threatening to sell it to the highest bidder on the dark web. Earlier this month that second group, known as RansomHub, sent WIRED alleged samples of the stolen data that appeared to come from Change Healthcare's network, including patient records and a contract with another health care company.As of Monday, strangely, the listing for that data on RansomHub's dark-web site had been taken down. Change Healthcare's post to its website, however, warns that 22 screenshots of its data had been posted to the dark web by an unnamed hacker group, and that they included \u201Cprotected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII),\u201D though it said it hadn't seen any sign that medical records like doctor's charts or full medical histories for any patients were among the stolen data.\nFor Change Healthcare and the beleaguered medical practices, hospitals, and patients that depend on it, the confirmation of its extortion payment to the hackers adds a bitter coda to an already dystopian story. AlphV's digital paralysis of Change Healthcare snarled the insurance approval of prescriptions and medical procedures for hundreds of medical practices and hospitals across the country, making it by some measures the most widespread medical ransomware disruption ever. A survey of American Medical Association members conducted between March 26 and April 3 found that four out of five clinicians had lost revenue as a result of the crisis. Many said they were using their own personal finances to cover a practice\u2019s expenses. Change Healthcare, meanwhile, says it has lost $872 million to the incident and projects that number to rise well over a billion in the longer term.\nChange Healthcare's confirmation of its ransom payment now appears to show that much of that catastrophic fallout for the US health care system unfolded after it had already paid the hackers an exorbitant sum\u2014a payment in exchange for a decryption key for the systems the hackers had encrypted and a promise not to leak the company's stolen data. As is often the case in ransomware attacks, AlphV's disruption of its systems appears to have been so widespread that Change Healthcare's recovery process has extended long after it obtained the decryption key designed to unlock its systems.\nAs ransomware payments go, $22 million isn't the most that a victim has forked over. But it's close, says Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused security researcher who spoke to WIRED about the suspected payment in March. Only a few rare payments, such as the $40 million paid to hackers by CNA Financial in 2021, top that number. \u201CIt\u2019s not without precedent, but it\u2019s certainly very unusual,\u201D Callow said of the $22 million figure.\nThat $22 million injection of funds into the ransomware ecosystem further fuels a vicious cycle that has reached epidemic proportions. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis found that in 2023, ransomware victims paid the hackers targeting them fully $1.1 billion, a new record. Change Healthcare's payment may represent only a small drop in that bucket, but it both rewards AlphV for its highly damaging attacks and may suggest to other ransomware groups that health care companies are particularly profitable targets, given those companies are especially sensitive to both the high cost of those cyberattacks financially and the risks they pose to patients' health.\nCompounding Change Healthcare's mess is an apparent double-cross within the ransomware underground: AlphV, by all appearances, faked its own law enforcement takedown after receiving Change Healthcare's payment in an attempt to avoid sharing it with its so-called affiliates, the hackers who partner with the group to penetrate victims on its behalf. The second ransomware group threatening Change Healthcare, RansomHub, now claims to WIRED that they obtained the stolen data from those affiliates, who still want to be paid for their work.\nThat has created a situation where Change Healthcare's payment provides little assurance that its compromised data won't still be exploited by disgruntled hackers. \u201CThese affiliates work for multiple groups. They\u2019re concerned with getting paid themselves, and there\u2019s no trust among thieves,\u201D Analyst1's DiMaggio told WIRED in March. \u201CIf someone screws someone else, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do with the data.\u201D\nAll of that means Change Healthcare still has little assurance that it has avoided an even worse scenario than it has yet faced: paying what may be one of the biggest ransoms in history and still seeing its data spilled onto the dark web. \u201CIf it gets leaked after they paid $22 million, it\u2019s pretty much like setting that money on fire,\u201D DiMaggio warned in March. \u201CThey\u2019d have burned that money for nothing.\u201D\nUpdated 10:25 am ET, May 1, 2024: UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty confirmed to a US Senate committee that the company paid $22 million in ransom.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Change Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a Patient Data Leak","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/change-healthcare-admits-it-paid-ransomware-hackers\/","tags":["","RANSOMWARE","HACKING","CYBERSECURITY","MALWARE","HEALTHCARE"]},{"date":"10.12.2023","summary":"Whoever looted FTX on the day of its bankruptcy has now moved the stolen money through a long string of intermediaries\u2014and eventually some that look Russian in origin.","post_content":"AS THE CRIMINAL trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried unfolds in a Manhattan courtroom, some observers in the cryptocurrency world have been watching a different FTX-related crime in progress: The still-unidentified thieves who stole more than $400 million out of FTX on the same day that the exchange declared bankruptcy have, after nine months of silence, been busy moving those funds across blockchains in an apparent attempt to cash out their loot while covering their tracks. Blockchain watchers still hope that money trail might help to identify the perpetrator of the heist\u2014and according to one crypto-tracing firm, some clues now suggest that those thieves may have ties to Russia.\nToday, cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic released a new report on the complex path those stolen funds have taken over the 11 months since they were pulled out of FTX on November 11 of last year. Elliptic's tracing shows how that nine-figure sum, which FTX puts at between $415 million and $432 million, has since moved through a long list of crypto services as the thieves attempt to prepare it for laundering and liquidation, and even through one service owned by FTX itself. But those hundreds of millions also sat idle for all of 2023\u2014only to begin to move again this month, in some cases as Bankman-Fried himself sat in court. \nMost tellingly, Elliptic's analysis is the first to note that whoever is laundering the stolen FTX funds appears to have ties to Russian cybercrime. One $8 million tranche of the money ended up in a pool of funds that also includes cryptocurrency from Russia-linked ransomware hackers and dark web markets. That commingling of funds suggests that, whether or not the actual thieves are Russian, the money launderers who received the stolen FTX's funds are likely Russian, or work with Russian cybercriminals. \n\u201CIt\u2019s looking increasingly likely that the perpetrator has links to Russia,\u201D says Elliptic's chief scientist and cofounder Tom Robison. \u201CWe can\u2019t attribute this to a Russian actor, but it\u2019s an indication it might be.\u201D\nSign Up Today\nKeep up-to-date with the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried by signing up for our Daily newsletter.\nFrom the first days of its money laundering process following the theft, Elliptic says the FTX thieves have largely taken steps typical for the perpetrators of large-scale crypto heists as the culprits sought to secure the funds, swap them for more easily laundered coins, and then funnel them through cryptocurrency \"mixing\" services to achieve that laundering. The majority of the stolen funds, Elliptic says, were stablecoins that, unlike other forms of cryptocurrency, can be frozen by their issuer in the case of theft. In fact, the stablecoin issuer Tether moved quickly to freeze $31 million of the stolen money in response to the FTX heist. So the thieves immediately began exchanging the rest of those stablecoins for other crypto tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap\u2014which don't have the know-your-customer requirements that centralized exchanges do, in part because they don't allow exchanges for fiat currency.\nIn the days that followed, Elliptic says, the thieves began a multi-step process to convert the tokens they'd traded the stablecoins for into cryptocurrencies that would be easier to launder. They used \u201Ccross-chain bridge\u201D services that allow cryptocurrencies to be exchanged from one blockchain to another, trading their tokens on the bridges Multichain and Wormhole to convert them to Ethereum. By the third day after the theft, the thieves held a single Ethereum account worth $306 million, down about $100 million from their initial total due to the Tether seizure and the cost of their trades.\nFrom there, the thieves appear to have focused on exchanging their Ethereum for Bitcoin, which is often easier to feed into \"mixing\" services that offer to blend a user's bitcoins with those of other users to prevent blockchain-based tracing. On November 20, nine days after the theft, they traded about a quarter of their Ethereum holdings for Bitcoin on a bridge service called RenBridge\u2014a service that was, ironically, itself owned by FTX. \u201CYes, it is quite amazing, really, that the proceeds of a hack were basically being laundered through a service owned by the victim of the hack,\u201D says Elliptic's Robison.On December 12, a month after the theft, most of the bitcoins from that RenBridge trade were then fed into a mixing service called ChipMixer. Like most mixing services, the now-defunct ChipMixer offered to take in user funds and return the same amount, minus a commission, from other sources, in theory muddling the money's trail on the blockchain. But Elliptic says it was nonetheless able to trace $8 million worth of the money to a pool of funds that also included the proceeds from Russia-linked ransomware and dark web markets, which was then sent to various exchanges to be cashed out. \n \u201CThere might have been a handoff from a thief to a launderer,\u201D says Robison. \u201CBut even if that was the case, it would mean the thief was in contact with someone who is part of a Russian money laundering operation.\u201D Robison adds that Elliptic has other intelligence pointing to the money launderers' Russian ties, but doesn't yet have permission from the source to make it public.\nAfter their initial attempt to launder a portion of the funds through ChipMixer, the thieves went strangely quiet. The rest of their Ethereum would remain dormant for the next nine months.\nOnly on September 30, just days ahead of Bankman-Fried's trial, did the remainder of the funds begin to move again, Elliptic says. By that time, both RenBridge and ChipMixer had been shut down\u2014RenBridge due to its parent company FTX's collapse and ChipMixer due to a law enforcement seizure. So the thieves pivoted to trading their Ethereum for Bitcoin on a service called THORSwap and then routing those bitcoins into a mixing service called Sinbad.\nSinbad has over the past year become a popular destination for criminal cryptocurrency, particularly crypto stolen by North Korean hackers. But Elliptic's Robison notes that despite this, the movement of funds appears less sophisticated than what he's seen in the typical North Korean heist. \u201CIt doesn't use some of the services that Lazarus typically use,\u201D Robison says, referring to the broad group of North Korean state-sponsored hackers known as Lazarus. \u201CSo it doesn't look like them.\u201D Robison notes that Sinbad is likely a rebranding of a mixing service called Blender that was hit with US sanctions last year, in part for helping to launder funds from Russian ransomware groups. Sinbad also offers customer support in English and Russian.\nDoes the timing of those new movements of funds ahead of\u2014and even during\u2014Bankman-Fried's trial suggest someone with insider knowledge is involved? Elliptic's Robison notes that, while the timing is conspicuous, he can only speculate at this point. It's possible that the timing has been purely coincidental, Robison says. Or someone might be moving the money now to make it look like an FTX insider\u2014potentially one who fears they might be about to lose their internet access. Neither Bankman-Fried nor his fellow executives have been charged with the theft, and some of the money movements have taken place while Bankman-Fried has been in court, with only a laptop disconnected from the internet.Eventually, no doubt, the thieves will attempt to cash out more of their stolen and laundered cryptocurrency for some sort of fiat currency. Robison is still hopeful that, despite their use of mixers, they can be further identified at that point. \u201CI think they probably will be successful in cashing out at least some of these funds. I think whether they're going to get away with it is a separate question,\u201D says Robison. \u201CThere's already a blockchain trail to be followed, and I think that trail will only become clearer with time.\u201D\nTwo other cryptocurrency tracing firms, TRM Labs and Chainalysis, have both been hired by FTX's new regime under CEO John Ray III to aid in the investigation. TRM Labs declined to comment on the case. Chainalysis didn\u2019t respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment, nor did FTX itself.\nAs those cryptocurrency tracers continue to follow the money, we may someday have a clearer answer to the mystery of the FTX heist. In the meantime, however, FTX's many aggrieved creditors will be left to keep one eye on Bankman-Fried's trial and the other on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nUpdated at 8:45 am ET, October 12, 2023, to add that Elliptic researchers found links to Russian cybercriminals.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"New Clues Suggest Stolen FTX Funds Went to Russia-Linked Money Launderers","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-hack-400-million-crypto-laundering\/","tags":["","FTX TRIAL","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRIME","HACKING"]},{"date":"03.27.2024","summary":"A jury convicted Roman Sterlingov of money laundering this month. His defense team says it will appeal, saying the crypto-tracing technique at the heart of the case is \u201Cpseudoscience.\u201D","post_content":"On March 12, Russian-Swedish national Roman Sterlingov was found guilty of money laundering conspiracy and other violations by a federal jury in Washington, DC, for having operated Bitcoin Fog, a service criminals used to launder what authorities claim was hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.\nThe conviction was heralded by the US Department of Justice as a victory over crypto-enabled criminality, but Sterlingov\u2019s lawyers maintain the case against him was flawed and plan to appeal. They allege that the nascent science used to collect evidence against him is not fit for the purpose.\nThe DOJ investigation used blockchain forensics, a technique whereby investigators scrutinize the public trail of crypto transactions to map the flow of funds. In a statement, Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general for the US, described the DOJ as \u201Cpainstakingly tracing bitcoin through the blockchain\u201D to identify Sterlingov as the pseudonymous administrator behind Bitcoin Fog.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acquired an undeserved reputation for being less traceable than conventional money, but evidence collected this way has brought down many criminals over the past decade. Blockchain forensics was crucial to the trial of Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous Silk Road marketplace. But in the Bitcoin Fog case, the defense has pulled this investigative technique into the spotlight, effectively putting crypto tracing on trial in place of their client. The case is a \u201Cfirst-of-its-kind,\u201D says Tor Ekeland, legal counsel to Sterlingov. \u201CNobody has challenged blockchain forensics before, because it\u2019s brand-new.\u201D\nBefore Sterlingov\u2019s trial, his attorneys asked the presiding judge to determine the admissibility of evidence from blockchain forensics experts that had used software from a firm called Chainalysis, which expedites the otherwise tedious process of sifting through the blockchain. He ruled the evidence was admissible.\nThat decision has been characterized by Michael Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, as an endorsement of his firm and its methods. \u201CWe are now the only company in the world with a stamp of approval for our ability to look at a blockchain and create evidence,\u201D he says. But Ekeland says he will work with Sterlingov to appeal both the guilty verdict and the judge\u2019s ruling on the validity of blockchain forensics. The conviction of Sterlingov is the latest example of the unhappy phenomenon, claims Ekeland, whereby \u201Cnewly emergent junk science leads to unjust verdicts.\u201D\nBeth Bisbee of Chainalysis, formerly the company\u2019s head of US investigations, disputes that characterization. \u201CThe evidence that the government presented to the jury demonstrated the exact opposite,\u201D says Bisbee, who testified as an expert witness at the trial. \u201COur methods are transparent, tested, reviewed, and reliable.\u201D\nNatsec Threat\nUntil it was shut down by US law enforcement in 2021, Bitcoin Fog supplied what's known as a crypto mixing or crypto tumbling service. Funds belonging to many parties are pooled, jumbled up, and spat out into brand-new wallets, masking the origin of the coins held in each. Mixers were originally promoted as a way to improve the level of privacy cryptocurrency could afford consumers, but they have been readily co-opted for the purpose of money laundering. Bitcoin Fog was among the first mixers to emerge, in 2011, making it \u201Cthe longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet,\u201D the DOJ says.\nIn the past few years, the US government has cracked down on crypto mixers, which it considers a threat to national security. After taking down Bitcoin Fog, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, another mixer, in 2022. The year after, it took down another, ChipMixer, and charged the founder with money laundering. To identify the individuals behind these operations, investigators had to follow the crypto money.In crypto\u2019s earliest years, the pseudonymous nature of transactions\u2014whereby coins are exchanged between wallets identified only by an alphanumeric address\u2014was frequently mistaken for anonymity. But beginning in late 2012 with the work of cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn, now a professor at University College London, among others, researchers began to figure out ways to group crypto wallets together, revealing connections that implied shared ownership. \u201CUltimately, you\u2019re trying to link one pile of money to another,\u201D says Meiklejohn. With this new knowledge, it became possible to attribute wallets to specific crypto exchanges or marketplaces, and to follow stolen funds. To identify the people who owned particular wallets, law enforcement could subpoena the exchanges they used to convert crypto into regular money. Logged on an open ledger for all to see, crypto transactions were not remotely anonymous.\nThis general methodology\u2014which Meiklejohn termed \u201Cclustering\u201D\u2014was taken up, further developed, and packaged into blockchain forensics services offered by firms like Chainalysis, which was used by the DOJ to help prosecute Sterlingov. \u201CIn academia, we are pretty far behind the state of the art at this point,\u201D says Meiklejohn. \u201CWe sort of accept that this is just an industry now.\u201D\nThe professionalization of blockchain forensics is central to Sterlingov\u2019s defense strategy in the Bitcoin Fog case. It is impossible to audit the clustering performed by the government for accuracy, a report commissioned by the defense submitted ahead of the trial claimed, because the inner workings of Chainalysis\u2019 software are private. There has been no peer review of the specific methodology the company uses, says Ekeland, nor is there any standards body for the blockchain forensics industry. \u201CIt should be illegal to use black box software in criminal prosecutions\u2014it should be open source. It violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront their accuser. It\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201D he claims. Chainalysis says the hearings on the admissibility of the company\u2019s evidence served as a check on its reliability.\n\u201CMushrooming Effect\u201D\nThe defense also disputes the way in which blockchain forensics evidence was interpreted, to finger Sterlingov as the operator of Bitcoin Fog. Although wallets belonging to Sterlingov might have interacted with the mixer, that does not prove him the service\u2019s operator, they argue. \u201CThe problem isn\u2019t so much that the blockchain is lying,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CThe flow of funds is not the same as the flow of control.\u201D\nWhile the government presented other forms of evidence it said tied Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog, like analysis of IP addresses linking him to the ownership of the web domain, Ekeland believes the blockchain forensics was critical in convincing the jury of his guilt. \u201CThe \u2018CSI effect\u2019 really hurt us,\u201D he says. \u201CThe jury placed undue importance on pseudoscientific evidence, because it was presented in a fancy chart and by the government.\u201D\nThe academics with whom the science of crypto tracing originated acknowledge that it should not be applied as evidence in isolation, or mischaracterized as some sort of a smoking gun. There remains some art to interpreting the information produced by blockchain analysis, says Meiklejohn, which introduces the opportunity for error. \u201CYou still have to decide if it means what you think it means, or whether there are other explanations,\u201D she says.\u201CI would not be comfortable [with blockchain forensics being the only form of evidence],\u201D says Philip Koshy, who alongside his wife Diana Koshy demonstrated in 2014 a way to identify the IP addresses associated with certain bitcoin transactions. \u201CIt ends up becoming scientific only if you can determine ground truth, using subpoena power.\u201D\nThe judge in the Sterlingov case pointed out in his ruling on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence that the DOJ had additional evidence pointing to the accused. \u201CThis is not a case in which the government\u2019s theory that Sterlingov was the operator of Bitcoin Fog turns exclusively, or even primarily, [on blockchain forensics],\u201D he wrote. In order to \u201Cestablish that crucial point,\u201D the judge noted, the government relied upon a range of information external to any blockchain, from IP addresses to forum posts.\nThe judge also took issue with the depiction of Chainalysis software as an inscrutable black box, on the grounds that the defense had been given information about its workings\u2014Ekeland disputes this characterization\u2014and pointed out that the underlying heuristics applied by the firm have been subject to peer review, even if its specific clustering methods have not been.\nFor maximum transparency, Chainalysis could open-source its software, but doing so would risk handing an advantage to bad actors. \u201CThis is a cat and mouse game,\u201D says Mieklejohn. \u201COnce you publish the heuristics, people understand how they work, and then they can take steps to evade those heuristics.\u201D In the circumstances, argues Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, the hearings on admissibility\u2014during which the company\u2019s work came under heavy scrutiny\u2014is the next best thing to a traditional peer review.\nIn the end, the effort to cast doubt over the reliability of blockchain forensics bore no fruit for the defense. \u201CThe Court is persuaded that blockchain analytics in general, and [Chainalysis\u2019 software] in particular, is not junk science,\u201D wrote the judge, in his summation on the admissibility question.\nThe ruling does not set a precedent that other US judges must follow, because the case has been confined so far to a district court. Nonetheless, Gronager is hopeful it will be the \u201Cfinal word\u201D on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence, at least until future developments in crypto tracing demand a reevaluation. \u201CThis is a landmark ruling,\u201D adds Bisbee of Chainalysis.\nWhile Ekeland is concerned about a \u201Cmushrooming effect,\u201D whereby the ruling will figure in the thinking of future judges, he claims the matter \u201Ccould take years to gel one way or the other.\u201D Among other quarrels with the way the case was tried, the use of blockchain forensic evidence will form part of the basis for Sterlingov\u2019s appeal. \u201CRight now, the momentum is in their favor,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CBut it\u2019s still an open battlefield.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6603759fd3a75d0aa76d16ab\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_tracing_forensics_trial.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"The Science of Crypto Forensics Survives a Court Battle\u2014for Now","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-science-of-crypto-forensics-court-battle\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRYPTOCURRENCIES","CRIME","DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE","MONEY","FINANCE"]},{"date":"01.26.2024","summary":"In his new book Read Write Own, investor Chris Dixon mounts a defense of blockchain, arguing it can save society from the monopoly power of tech giants.","post_content":"A survey of headlines from the past couple of years in the cryptocurrency industry might lead anyone to believe that it is a deeply unserious business.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65b31346997eb849e52195f0\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_blockchain_save_future.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A Last-Ditch Plan to Save the Crypto Industry","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/a-last-ditch-plan-to-save-the-crypto-industry\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","INVESTING","VENTURE CAPITAL","FTX TRIAL","INTERNET CULTURE","ANTITRUST"]},{"date":"05.01.2024","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model\u2014and the 200-million-transaction dataset it's trained on\u2014that aims to spot the \u201Cshape\u201D of bitcoin money laundering.","post_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can't see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world\u2019s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web\u2019s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nThat 180-degree flip in the world\u2019s understanding of cryptocurrency\u2019s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn\u2019s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer\u2019s mining power to 11 different mining \u201Cpools,\u201D groups that collected users\u2019 computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\nPHOTOGRAPH: PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nWalmart\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\nMeiklejohn\u2019s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists\u2019 idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous.\nA collage from Meiklejohn\u2019s research paper showing every object she bought with Bitcoin in her tracing experiments.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNAS MEIKLEJOHN PAINSTAKINGLY fiddled with bitcoins and watched the digital trails they created, she found herself having flashbacks to a particular day, decades earlier, in her mother\u2019s downtown Manhattan office. That morning, Meiklejohn and her mother had taken the subway together, all the way from their Upper West Side apartment near the American Museum of Natural History to the federal building at Foley Square, across from the city\u2019s intimidating, stone-columned courthouses.\nMeiklejohn was still in elementary school, but it was take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Meiklejohn\u2019s mother was a federal prosecutor. Over the years that followed, the elder Meiklejohn would make her career taking on contractors who were bilking the city government out of tax dollars\u2014bribing government staffers to choose overpriced school food or street-paving services\u2014or else banks colluding to sell low-performing investments to the city\u2019s financiers. Many of her targets in those corruption probes would be sentenced to years in prison.\nThat day in the Justice Department\u2019s New York office, Sarah Meiklejohn, not yet 10 years old, was put to work. She was assigned to comb through a pile of paper checks, searching for clues of a corrupt kickback scheme in one of her mother\u2019s investigations.\nIt was that feeling, the drive to manually assemble tiny data points that built into a larger picture, that would give Meiklejohn a kind of déjà vu 20 years later as she studied the Bitcoin blockchain, even before she consciously knew what she was doing.\n\u201CSomewhere in the back of my mind was this idea,\u201D says Meiklejohn, \u201Cthe idea of following the money.\u201D\nAs a child, Meiklejohn loved puzzles\u2014the more complex, the better. On road trips, in airports, or any other time the small-for-her-age, hyper-inquisitive girl needed to be distracted, her mother would hand her a book of puzzles. One of the first websites Meiklejohn remembers visiting on the nascent World Wide Web was a GeoCities page devoted to deciphering the Kryptos sculpture on the campus of the CIA, whose copper, ribbonlike surface contained four coded messages that even the cryptanalysts at Langley hadn\u2019t been able to crack. By the age of 14 she would finish the New York Times crossword puzzle every day of the week.\nOn a vacation to London, Meiklejohn\u2019s family visited the British Museum, and Meiklejohn became fixated on the Rosetta stone, along with the broader notion of ancient languages\u2014the remnants of entire cultures\u2014that could be deciphered if the puzzler simply found the right key. Soon she was reading about Linear A and Linear B, a pair of written scripts used by the Minoan civilization on Crete until roughly 1500 BC. Linear B had been deciphered only in the 1950s, thanks in large part to a classicist at Brooklyn College named Alice Kober who labored in obscurity over samples of the Bronze Age language for 20 years, writing her notes on 180,000 index cards.\nMeiklejohn became so obsessed with Linear A and B that she persuaded a teacher at her middle school to organize an evening seminar on the subject (only she and one friend attended). More tantalizing than even the story of Alice Kober\u2019s work on Linear B, for Meiklejohn, was the fact that no one had been able to decipher Linear A, even after a century of study. The best puzzles of all were the ones that had no answer key\u2014the ones for which no one even knew if a solution existed.When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201Cunbreakable\u201D system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\nMEIKLEJOHN SHOWED REAL talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.Considering Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics for the first time, Meiklejohn was intrigued. But when she got home from the hike and began poring over Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper, it immediately became clear to her that Bitcoin\u2019s trade-offs were the exact opposite of the eCash system she knew so well. Fraud was prevented not by a kind of after-the-fact forgery analysis carried out by a bank authority but with an instantaneous check of the blockchain, the unforgeable public record of who possessed every single bitcoin.\nBut that blockchain ledger system came at an enormous privacy cost: In Bitcoin, for good and for ill, everyone was a witness to every payment. Yes, identities behind those payments were obscured by pseudonymous addresses, long strings of between 26 and 35 characters. But to Meiklejohn, this seemed like an inherently dangerous sort of fig leaf to hide behind. Unlike eCash, whose privacy protections offered snoops no hint of revealing information to latch onto, Bitcoin offered an enormous collection of data to analyze. Who could say what sorts of patterns might give away users who thought they were cleverer than those watching them?\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CAnd so as a cryptographer, the natural question was, if you can\u2019t prove it\u2019s private, then what attacks are possible? If you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nThe temptation was more than Meiklejohn could resist. The blockchain, like a massive, undeciphered corpus of an ancient language, hid a wealth of secrets in plain view.\nWHEN MEIKLEJOHN BEGAN digging into the blockchain in late 2012, she started with a very simple question: How many people were using bitcoin?\nThat number was much harder to pin down than it might seem. After downloading the entire blockchain onto a UCSD server and organizing it into a database that she could query, like a gargantuan, searchable spreadsheet, she could see that there were more than 12 million distinct Bitcoin addresses, among which there had been nearly 16 million transactions. But even amid all that activity, there were plenty of recognizable events in Bitcoin\u2019s history visible to the naked eye. Spenders and recipients might have been hidden behind pseudonymous addresses, but some transactions were unmistakable, like distinctive pieces of furniture hidden under thin sheets in someone\u2019s attic.\nShe could see, for instance, the nearly 1 million bitcoins that were mined by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency, before others started using it, as well as the first transaction ever made when Satoshi sent 10 coins as a test to the early Bitcoin developer Hal Finney in January 2009. She spotted, too, the first payment with real value, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz famously sold a friend two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010 (as of this writing worth hundreds of millions of dollars).\nPlenty of other addresses and transactions had been recognized and widely discussed on forums like Bitcointalk, and Meiklejohn spent hours cutting and pasting long strings of characters into Google to see if someone had already claimed credit for an address or if other Bitcoin users had been gossiping about certain high-value transactions. By the time Meiklejohn began to look, anyone with enough interest and patience to wade through a sea of garbled addresses could see money transfers between mysterious parties just beneath the surface of the blockchain\u2019s obfuscation that, even at the time, were often worth small fortunes.Getting beyond that obfuscation, however, was the real challenge. Sure, Meiklejohn could see transactions between addresses. But the problem was drilling down further, definitively drawing a boundary around the bitcoin hoard of any single person or organization. A user could have as many addresses as they chose to create with one of the many wallet programs that managed their coins\u2014like a bank that allows you to spread your wealth across as many accounts as you liked, creating new ones with a mouse click. Plenty of those programs even automatically generated new addresses every time the user received a bitcoin payment, adding to the confusion.\nStill, Meiklejohn was sure that searching for patterns in the mess of transactions would allow her to untangle at least some of them. In Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s own original white paper, Meiklejohn recalled that he had briefly alluded to a technique that could be used to collapse some addresses into single identities. Often, a single bitcoin transaction has multiple \u201Cinputs\u201D from different addresses. If someone wants to pay a friend 10 bitcoins but holds those coins at two different addresses of five coins each, the spender\u2019s wallet software creates a single transaction that lists the two five-coin addresses as inputs and the address receiving 10 coins as the output. To make the payment possible, the payer would need to possess both of the so-called secret keys that allow the five coins at each address to be spent. That means anyone looking at the transaction on the blockchain can reasonably identify both of the input addresses as belonging to the same person or organization.\nSatoshi had hinted at the privacy dangers this introduced. \u201CSome linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,\u201D Satoshi wrote. \u201CThe risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.\u201D\nSo, as Meiklejohn\u2019s first step, she simply tried the technique Satoshi had inadvertently suggested\u2014across every bitcoin payment ever carried out. She scanned her blockchain database for every multi-input transaction, linking all of those double, triple, or even hundredfold inputs to single identities. The result immediately reduced the number of potential Bitcoin users from 12 million to date to around 5 million, slicing away more than half of the problem.\nMeiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked.\nOnly after that initial step\u2014practically a freebie\u2014did Meiklejohn switch her brain into true puzzle-solving mode. Like a 20th-century archaeologist scanning hieroglyphics for identifiable words or phrases that might help to decipher a passage of text, she began to hunt through Bitcoin\u2019s transactions for other clues that might reveal identifying information. Messing around with bitcoin wallets\u2014making test payments to herself and her colleagues\u2014she began to understand a quirk of the cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin wallets only allowed spenders to pay the entire amount of coins sitting at a certain address. Each address was like a piggy bank that has to be smashed open to spend the coins inside. Spend less than the whole amount in that piggy bank and the leftovers have to be stored in a newly created piggy bank.\nThis second piggy bank, in Bitcoin\u2019s system, is called a \u201Cchange\u201D address: When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient\u2019s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn\u2019t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address\u2014a piggy bank that had materialized on the spot to receive leftover coins from the one that had just been shattered. And that meant these two piggy banks\u2014the spender\u2019s address and the change address\u2014must belong to the same person.\nMeiklejohn began to apply that change-making lens, looking for instances where she could link spenders and the remainders of their payments. She began to see how powerful the simple act of tracking bitcoin change could be: In instances where she couldn\u2019t distinguish a recipient address from a change address, she would be stuck at a fork in the road with no signposts. But if she could link change addresses to the addresses they had split off from, she could make her own signposts. She could follow the money despite its branching paths.\nThe result was that Meiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked: A single sum of coins would move from change address to change address as the spender paid fractions of the total pile of coins in one small payment after another. The remainder of the pile might move to a fresh address with each payment, but those addresses must all represent the transactions of a single spender.\nShe\u2019d come to refer to those chains of transactions as \u201Cpeeling chains\u201D (or sometimes just \u201Cpeel chains\u201D). She thought of them like someone peeling bills off a roll of dollar bills: Though the roll of bills might be put back in a different pocket after a bill was peeled off and spent, it was still fundamentally one wad of cash with a consistent owner. Following these peeling chains opened avenues to trace the digital money\u2019s movements like never before.\nMeiklejohn now had two clever techniques, both of which were capable of linking multiple Bitcoin addresses to a single person or organization, what she came to call \u201Cclustering.\u201D What had initially looked like disparate addresses could now be connected into clusters that encompassed hundreds or, in some cases, even thousands of addresses.\nAlready, she was tracing bitcoins in ways that many of the cryptocurrency\u2019s users wouldn\u2019t have believed possible. But following coins didn\u2019t necessarily mean understanding who owned them. The identities behind those coins remained a mystery, and each of her clusters remained just as pseudonymous as the single, disconnected addresses had been originally. To put a name to those clusters, she began to realize, she\u2019d have to take a much more hands-on approach: not simply observing the artifacts of the Bitcoin economy after the fact like an archaeologist, but becoming a player in it herself\u2014in some cases, an undercover one.\nSEARCHING FOR GUIDANCE in her budding Bitcoin research, Meiklejohn turned to Stefan Savage, a UCSD professor who was on the other end of the spectrum from the deeply mathematical cryptography research Meiklejohn had spent years on. Savage was a hands-on, empirical researcher, more interested in real-world experiments with real-world results than abstractions. He had been one of the lead advisers of a now-legendary team of researchers who had first shown it was possible to hack a car over the internet, demonstrating to General Motors in 2011 that his team could remotely take over a Chevy Impala\u2019s steering and brakes via the cellular radio in its OnStar system, a shocking feat of hacker wizardry.More recently, Savage had helped lead a group that included Kirill Levchenko\u2014the scientist who\u2019d introduced Meiklejohn to Bitcoin on their desert hike\u2014working on a massively ambitious project to track the spam email ecosystem. In that research, as with the earlier car-hacking breakthrough, Savage\u2019s team hadn\u2019t been afraid to get their hands dirty: They\u2019d collected hundreds of millions of web links in junk marketing emails, mostly ones intended to sell real and fake pharmaceuticals. Then, as Savage describes it, they acted out the role of \u201Cthe world\u2019s most gullible person,\u201D using bots to click through on every one of those links to see where they led and spending more than $50,000 on the products the spammers were hawking\u2014all while working with a cooperative credit card issuer to trace the funds and see which banks ended up with the money.\nSeveral of those shady banks were ultimately shut down as a result of the researchers\u2019 tracing work. As another UCSD professor working on the project, Geoffrey Voelker, described it at the time, \u201COur secret weapon is shopping.\u201D\nSo when Meiklejohn began talking over her Bitcoin tracking project with Savage, the two agreed she should take the same approach: She would manually identify Bitcoin addresses one by one by doing transactions with them herself, like a cop on the narcotics beat carrying out buy-and-busts.\nThat\u2019s how Meiklejohn found herself in the early weeks of 2013 ordering coffee, cupcakes, trading cards, mugs, baseball hats, silver coins, socks, and a closet\u2019s worth of other truly random objects from online vendors who accepted bitcoin; joining more than a dozen mining collectives; fiendishly gambling bitcoins at every online crypto casino she could find; and moving bitcoins into and out of accounts on practically every existing bitcoin exchange\u2014and the Silk Road\u2014again and again.\nThe hundreds of addresses Meiklejohn identified and tagged manually with those 344 transactions represented only the tiniest fraction of the overall bitcoin landscape. But when she combined her address tagging with her chaining and clustering techniques, many of those tags suddenly identified not just a single address but an enormous cluster belonging to the same owner. With just a few hundred tags, she had put an identity to more than a million of Bitcoin\u2019s once-pseudonymous addresses.\nA chart from Meiklejohn\u2019s paper showing her \u201Cclustering\u201D of Bitcoin addresses for early cryptocurrency entities.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNWith just the 30 addresses she had identified by moving coins into and out of Mt. Gox, for instance, she could now link more than 500,000 addresses to the exchange. And based on just four deposits and seven withdrawals into wallets on the Silk Road, she was able to identify nearly 300,000 of the black market\u2019s addresses. This breakthrough didn\u2019t mean Meiklejohn could identify any actual users of the Silk Road by name, nor could she unmask, of course, the mysterious kingpin of that site, the ultra libertarian Dread Pirate Roberts. But it would directly contradict DPR\u2019s claims to me that his Bitcoin \u201Ctumbler\u201D system could prevent observers from even seeing when users moved cryptocurrency into and out of their Silk Road accounts.\nWhen Meiklejohn brought her results back to Savage, her adviser was impressed. But as they began to plan to publish a paper on her findings, he wanted a concrete demonstration for readers, not a bunch of arcane statistics. \u201CWe need to show people,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers him saying, \u201Cwhat these techniques can actually do.\u201D\nSo Meiklejohn went a step further: She began to look for specific bitcoin transactions she could track\u2014particularly criminal ones.\nAS MEIKLEJOHN HAD trawled cryptocurrency forums for discussions of interesting addresses worth scrutinizing, one mysterious mountain of money in particular stood out: This single address had, over the course of 2012, accumulated 613,326 bitcoins\u20145 percent of all the coins in circulation. It represented around $7.5 million at the time, a figure nowhere near the billions it would represent today, but a heady sum nonetheless. Rumors among Bitcoin users suggested that the hoard was possibly a Silk Road wallet, or perhaps the result of an unrelated, notorious Bitcoin Ponzi scheme carried out by a user known as pirate@40.\nMeiklejohn couldn\u2019t say which of the two rumors might be correct. But with her clustering techniques, she could now follow that giant sum of cryptocurrency. She saw that after conspicuously gathering at one address, the pile of money had been broken up in late 2012 and sent on forking paths around the blockchain. Meiklejohn\u2019s understanding of peel chains meant she could now trace those sums of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as they split, distinguishing the amount that remained in the control of the initial owner from the smaller sums that were peeled off in subsequent payments. Eventually, several of those peel chains led to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, where they seemed to be cashed out for traditional currency. For an academic researcher, this was a dead end. But anyone with the subpoena power of law enforcement, Meiklejohn realized, could very likely force those exchanges to hand over information about the accounts behind those transactions and solve the mystery of the $7.5 million stash.\nFar from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\nLooking for more coins to hunt, Meiklejohn turned her focus to another sort of dirty money. Large-scale cryptocurrency heists were, in early 2013, a growing epidemic. After all, bitcoin was like cash or gold. Anyone who stole a Bitcoin address\u2019s secret key could empty out that address like a digital safe. Unlike with credit cards or other digital payment systems, there was no overseer who could stop or reverse the money\u2019s movement. That had made every bitcoin business and its stash of crypto revenue a ripe target for hackers, especially if the holders of those funds made the mistake of storing their secret keys on internet-connected computers\u2014the equivalent of carrying six- or seven-figure sums of cash in their pockets while strolling through a dangerous neighborhood.\nMeiklejohn found a thread on Bitcointalk that listed addresses of many of the biggest, most conspicuous crypto thefts in recent memory, and she began to follow the money. Looking at a robbery of 3,171 coins from an early bitcoin gambling site, she immediately found she could trace the stolen funds across no fewer than ten hops, from address to address, before different branches of the money were cashed out at exchanges. Another theft of 18,500 bitcoins from the exchange Bitcoinica similarly led her along a winding series of peel chains that ended at three other exchanges, where the robbers were no doubt cashing in their ill-gotten gains. Sitting in front of Meiklejohn, on her screen, was a bonanza of leads, each just waiting for any actual criminal investigator with a handful of subpoenas to follow them.Now, when Meiklejohn showed Savage her results, he agreed: They were ready to publish.\nIn the final draft of the paper Meiklejohn and her coauthors put together, they definitively stated conclusions\u2014based for the first time on solid, empirical evidence\u2014that flew in the face of what many Bitcoin users believed at the time: Far from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\n\u201CEven our relatively small experiment demonstrates that this approach can shed considerable light on the structure of the Bitcoin economy, how it is used, and those organizations who are party to it,\u201D the paper read. \u201CWe demonstrate that an agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the public nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary flows to major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.\u201D\nHaving set down those words, and blowing a gaping hole in the myth of Bitcoin\u2019s inherent untraceability, Meiklejohn, Savage, and her other adviser Geoffrey Voelker started brainstorming a clever title. In an homage to the Wild West of the economy they were chronicling\u2014and her advisers\u2019 mutual love of spaghetti Westerns\u2014they started with the phrase \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins,\u201D an allusion to the 1960s Clint Eastwood classic A Fistful of Dollars. They settled on a subtitle that evoked both Eastwood\u2019s most famous cowboy vigilante and the world of shadowy figures their nascent techniques could unmask. When the UCSD paper hit the internet in August 2013, it was introduced with a description that, to those involved, had come to seem inevitable: \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.\u201D\nIn the new era of cryptocurrency tracing that would follow Meiklejohn\u2019s work, they wouldn\u2019t remain nameless for long.\nAdapted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency.

His defense team says it will appeal, saying the crypto-tracing technique at the heart of the case is \u201Cpseudoscience.\u201D","post_content":"On March 12, Russian-Swedish national Roman Sterlingov was found guilty of money laundering conspiracy and other violations by a federal jury in Washington, DC, for having operated Bitcoin Fog, a service criminals used to launder what authorities claim was hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.\nThe conviction was heralded by the US Department of Justice as a victory over crypto-enabled criminality, but Sterlingov\u2019s lawyers maintain the case against him was flawed and plan to appeal. They allege that the nascent science used to collect evidence against him is not fit for the purpose.\nThe DOJ investigation used blockchain forensics, a technique whereby investigators scrutinize the public trail of crypto transactions to map the flow of funds. In a statement, Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general for the US, described the DOJ as \u201Cpainstakingly tracing bitcoin through the blockchain\u201D to identify Sterlingov as the pseudonymous administrator behind Bitcoin Fog.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acquired an undeserved reputation for being less traceable than conventional money, but evidence collected this way has brought down many criminals over the past decade. Blockchain forensics was crucial to the trial of Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous Silk Road marketplace. But in the Bitcoin Fog case, the defense has pulled this investigative technique into the spotlight, effectively putting crypto tracing on trial in place of their client. The case is a \u201Cfirst-of-its-kind,\u201D says Tor Ekeland, legal counsel to Sterlingov. \u201CNobody has challenged blockchain forensics before, because it\u2019s brand-new.\u201D\nBefore Sterlingov\u2019s trial, his attorneys asked the presiding judge to determine the admissibility of evidence from blockchain forensics experts that had used software from a firm called Chainalysis, which expedites the otherwise tedious process of sifting through the blockchain. He ruled the evidence was admissible.\nThat decision has been characterized by Michael Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, as an endorsement of his firm and its methods. \u201CWe are now the only company in the world with a stamp of approval for our ability to look at a blockchain and create evidence,\u201D he says. But Ekeland says he will work with Sterlingov to appeal both the guilty verdict and the judge\u2019s ruling on the validity of blockchain forensics. The conviction of Sterlingov is the latest example of the unhappy phenomenon, claims Ekeland, whereby \u201Cnewly emergent junk science leads to unjust verdicts.\u201D\nBeth Bisbee of Chainalysis, formerly the company\u2019s head of US investigations, disputes that characterization. \u201CThe evidence that the government presented to the jury demonstrated the exact opposite,\u201D says Bisbee, who testified as an expert witness at the trial. \u201COur methods are transparent, tested, reviewed, and reliable.\u201D\nNatsec Threat\nUntil it was shut down by US law enforcement in 2021, Bitcoin Fog supplied what's known as a crypto mixing or crypto tumbling service. Funds belonging to many parties are pooled, jumbled up, and spat out into brand-new wallets, masking the origin of the coins held in each. Mixers were originally promoted as a way to improve the level of privacy cryptocurrency could afford consumers, but they have been readily co-opted for the purpose of money laundering. Bitcoin Fog was among the first mixers to emerge, in 2011, making it \u201Cthe longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet,\u201D the DOJ says.\nIn the past few years, the US government has cracked down on crypto mixers, which it considers a threat to national security. After taking down Bitcoin Fog, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, another mixer, in 2022. The year after, it took down another, ChipMixer, and charged the founder with money laundering. To identify the individuals behind these operations, investigators had to follow the crypto money.In crypto\u2019s earliest years, the pseudonymous nature of transactions\u2014whereby coins are exchanged between wallets identified only by an alphanumeric address\u2014was frequently mistaken for anonymity. But beginning in late 2012 with the work of cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn, now a professor at University College London, among others, researchers began to figure out ways to group crypto wallets together, revealing connections that implied shared ownership. \u201CUltimately, you\u2019re trying to link one pile of money to another,\u201D says Meiklejohn. With this new knowledge, it became possible to attribute wallets to specific crypto exchanges or marketplaces, and to follow stolen funds. To identify the people who owned particular wallets, law enforcement could subpoena the exchanges they used to convert crypto into regular money. Logged on an open ledger for all to see, crypto transactions were not remotely anonymous.\nThis general methodology\u2014which Meiklejohn termed \u201Cclustering\u201D\u2014was taken up, further developed, and packaged into blockchain forensics services offered by firms like Chainalysis, which was used by the DOJ to help prosecute Sterlingov. \u201CIn academia, we are pretty far behind the state of the art at this point,\u201D says Meiklejohn. \u201CWe sort of accept that this is just an industry now.\u201D\nThe professionalization of blockchain forensics is central to Sterlingov\u2019s defense strategy in the Bitcoin Fog case. It is impossible to audit the clustering performed by the government for accuracy, a report commissioned by the defense submitted ahead of the trial claimed, because the inner workings of Chainalysis\u2019 software are private. There has been no peer review of the specific methodology the company uses, says Ekeland, nor is there any standards body for the blockchain forensics industry. \u201CIt should be illegal to use black box software in criminal prosecutions\u2014it should be open source. It violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront their accuser. It\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201D he claims. Chainalysis says the hearings on the admissibility of the company\u2019s evidence served as a check on its reliability.\n\u201CMushrooming Effect\u201D\nThe defense also disputes the way in which blockchain forensics evidence was interpreted, to finger Sterlingov as the operator of Bitcoin Fog. Although wallets belonging to Sterlingov might have interacted with the mixer, that does not prove him the service\u2019s operator, they argue. \u201CThe problem isn\u2019t so much that the blockchain is lying,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CThe flow of funds is not the same as the flow of control.\u201D\nWhile the government presented other forms of evidence it said tied Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog, like analysis of IP addresses linking him to the ownership of the web domain, Ekeland believes the blockchain forensics was critical in convincing the jury of his guilt. \u201CThe \u2018CSI effect\u2019 really hurt us,\u201D he says. \u201CThe jury placed undue importance on pseudoscientific evidence, because it was presented in a fancy chart and by the government.\u201D\nThe academics with whom the science of crypto tracing originated acknowledge that it should not be applied as evidence in isolation, or mischaracterized as some sort of a smoking gun. There remains some art to interpreting the information produced by blockchain analysis, says Meiklejohn, which introduces the opportunity for error. \u201CYou still have to decide if it means what you think it means, or whether there are other explanations,\u201D she says.\u201CI would not be comfortable [with blockchain forensics being the only form of evidence],\u201D says Philip Koshy, who alongside his wife Diana Koshy demonstrated in 2014 a way to identify the IP addresses associated with certain bitcoin transactions. \u201CIt ends up becoming scientific only if you can determine ground truth, using subpoena power.\u201D\nThe judge in the Sterlingov case pointed out in his ruling on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence that the DOJ had additional evidence pointing to the accused. \u201CThis is not a case in which the government\u2019s theory that Sterlingov was the operator of Bitcoin Fog turns exclusively, or even primarily, [on blockchain forensics],\u201D he wrote. In order to \u201Cestablish that crucial point,\u201D the judge noted, the government relied upon a range of information external to any blockchain, from IP addresses to forum posts.\nThe judge also took issue with the depiction of Chainalysis software as an inscrutable black box, on the grounds that the defense had been given information about its workings\u2014Ekeland disputes this characterization\u2014and pointed out that the underlying heuristics applied by the firm have been subject to peer review, even if its specific clustering methods have not been.\nFor maximum transparency, Chainalysis could open-source its software, but doing so would risk handing an advantage to bad actors. \u201CThis is a cat and mouse game,\u201D says Mieklejohn. \u201COnce you publish the heuristics, people understand how they work, and then they can take steps to evade those heuristics.\u201D In the circumstances, argues Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, the hearings on admissibility\u2014during which the company\u2019s work came under heavy scrutiny\u2014is the next best thing to a traditional peer review.\nIn the end, the effort to cast doubt over the reliability of blockchain forensics bore no fruit for the defense. \u201CThe Court is persuaded that blockchain analytics in general, and [Chainalysis\u2019 software] in particular, is not junk science,\u201D wrote the judge, in his summation on the admissibility question.\nThe ruling does not set a precedent that other US judges must follow, because the case has been confined so far to a district court. Nonetheless, Gronager is hopeful it will be the \u201Cfinal word\u201D on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence, at least until future developments in crypto tracing demand a reevaluation. \u201CThis is a landmark ruling,\u201D adds Bisbee of Chainalysis.\nWhile Ekeland is concerned about a \u201Cmushrooming effect,\u201D whereby the ruling will figure in the thinking of future judges, he claims the matter \u201Ccould take years to gel one way or the other.\u201D Among other quarrels with the way the case was tried, the use of blockchain forensic evidence will form part of the basis for Sterlingov\u2019s appeal. \u201CRight now, the momentum is in their favor,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CBut it\u2019s still an open battlefield.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6603759fd3a75d0aa76d16ab\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_tracing_forensics_trial.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"The Science of Crypto Forensics Survives a Court Battle\u2014for Now","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-science-of-crypto-forensics-court-battle\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRYPTOCURRENCIES","CRIME","DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE","MONEY","FINANCE"]},{"date":"01.26.2024","summary":"In his new book Read Write Own, investor Chris Dixon mounts a defense of blockchain, arguing it can save society from the monopoly power of tech giants.","post_content":"A survey of headlines from the past couple of years in the cryptocurrency industry might lead anyone to believe that it is a deeply unserious business.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65b31346997eb849e52195f0\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_blockchain_save_future.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A Last-Ditch Plan to Save the Crypto Industry","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/a-last-ditch-plan-to-save-the-crypto-industry\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","INVESTING","VENTURE CAPITAL","FTX TRIAL","INTERNET CULTURE","ANTITRUST"]},{"date":"05.01.2024","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model\u2014and the 200-million-transaction dataset it's trained on\u2014that aims to spot the \u201Cshape\u201D of bitcoin money laundering.","post_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can't see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

Nonetheless, Gronager is hopeful it will be the \u201Cfinal word\u201D on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence, at least until future developments in crypto tracing demand a reevaluation. \u201CThis is a landmark ruling,\u201D adds Bisbee of Chainalysis.\nWhile Ekeland is concerned about a \u201Cmushrooming effect,\u201D whereby the ruling will figure in the thinking of future judges, he claims the matter \u201Ccould take years to gel one way or the other.\u201D Among other quarrels with the way the case was tried, the use of blockchain forensic evidence will form part of the basis for Sterlingov\u2019s appeal. \u201CRight now, the momentum is in their favor,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CBut it\u2019s still an open battlefield.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6603759fd3a75d0aa76d16ab\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_tracing_forensics_trial.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"The Science of Crypto Forensics Survives a Court Battle\u2014for Now","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-science-of-crypto-forensics-court-battle\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRYPTOCURRENCIES","CRIME","DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE","MONEY","FINANCE"]},{"date":"01.26.2024","summary":"In his new book Read Write Own, investor Chris Dixon mounts a defense of blockchain, arguing it can save society from the monopoly power of tech giants.","post_content":"A survey of headlines from the past couple of years in the cryptocurrency industry might lead anyone to believe that it is a deeply unserious business.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65b31346997eb849e52195f0\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_blockchain_save_future.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A Last-Ditch Plan to Save the Crypto Industry","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/a-last-ditch-plan-to-save-the-crypto-industry\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","INVESTING","VENTURE CAPITAL","FTX TRIAL","INTERNET CULTURE","ANTITRUST"]},{"date":"05.01.2024","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model\u2014and the 200-million-transaction dataset it's trained on\u2014that aims to spot the \u201Cshape\u201D of bitcoin money laundering.","post_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can't see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

Then a grad student named Sarah Meiklejohn proved them all wrong\u2014and set the stage for a decade-long crackdown.","post_content":"JUST OVER A decade ago, Bitcoin appeared to many of its adherents to be the crypto-anarchist holy grail: truly private digital cash for the internet.\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency\u2019s mysterious and unidentifiable inventor, had stated in an email introducing Bitcoin that \u201Cparticipants can be anonymous.\u201D And the Silk Road dark-web drug market seemed like living proof of that potential, enabling the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal drugs and other contraband for bitcoin while flaunting its impunity from law enforcement.\nThis is the story of the revelation in late 2013 that Bitcoin was, in fact, the opposite of untraceable\u2014that its blockchain would actually allow researchers, tech companies, and law enforcement to trace and identify users with even more transparency than the existing financial system. That discovery would upend the world of cybercrime. Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world\u2019s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web\u2019s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nThat 180-degree flip in the world\u2019s understanding of cryptocurrency\u2019s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn\u2019s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer\u2019s mining power to 11 different mining \u201Cpools,\u201D groups that collected users\u2019 computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\nPHOTOGRAPH: PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nWalmart\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\nMeiklejohn\u2019s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists\u2019 idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous.\nA collage from Meiklejohn\u2019s research paper showing every object she bought with Bitcoin in her tracing experiments.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNAS MEIKLEJOHN PAINSTAKINGLY fiddled with bitcoins and watched the digital trails they created, she found herself having flashbacks to a particular day, decades earlier, in her mother\u2019s downtown Manhattan office. That morning, Meiklejohn and her mother had taken the subway together, all the way from their Upper West Side apartment near the American Museum of Natural History to the federal building at Foley Square, across from the city\u2019s intimidating, stone-columned courthouses.\nMeiklejohn was still in elementary school, but it was take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Meiklejohn\u2019s mother was a federal prosecutor. Over the years that followed, the elder Meiklejohn would make her career taking on contractors who were bilking the city government out of tax dollars\u2014bribing government staffers to choose overpriced school food or street-paving services\u2014or else banks colluding to sell low-performing investments to the city\u2019s financiers. Many of her targets in those corruption probes would be sentenced to years in prison.\nThat day in the Justice Department\u2019s New York office, Sarah Meiklejohn, not yet 10 years old, was put to work. She was assigned to comb through a pile of paper checks, searching for clues of a corrupt kickback scheme in one of her mother\u2019s investigations.\nIt was that feeling, the drive to manually assemble tiny data points that built into a larger picture, that would give Meiklejohn a kind of déjà vu 20 years later as she studied the Bitcoin blockchain, even before she consciously knew what she was doing.\n\u201CSomewhere in the back of my mind was this idea,\u201D says Meiklejohn, \u201Cthe idea of following the money.\u201D\nAs a child, Meiklejohn loved puzzles\u2014the more complex, the better. On road trips, in airports, or any other time the small-for-her-age, hyper-inquisitive girl needed to be distracted, her mother would hand her a book of puzzles. One of the first websites Meiklejohn remembers visiting on the nascent World Wide Web was a GeoCities page devoted to deciphering the Kryptos sculpture on the campus of the CIA, whose copper, ribbonlike surface contained four coded messages that even the cryptanalysts at Langley hadn\u2019t been able to crack. By the age of 14 she would finish the New York Times crossword puzzle every day of the week.\nOn a vacation to London, Meiklejohn\u2019s family visited the British Museum, and Meiklejohn became fixated on the Rosetta stone, along with the broader notion of ancient languages\u2014the remnants of entire cultures\u2014that could be deciphered if the puzzler simply found the right key. Soon she was reading about Linear A and Linear B, a pair of written scripts used by the Minoan civilization on Crete until roughly 1500 BC. Linear B had been deciphered only in the 1950s, thanks in large part to a classicist at Brooklyn College named Alice Kober who labored in obscurity over samples of the Bronze Age language for 20 years, writing her notes on 180,000 index cards.\nMeiklejohn became so obsessed with Linear A and B that she persuaded a teacher at her middle school to organize an evening seminar on the subject (only she and one friend attended). More tantalizing than even the story of Alice Kober\u2019s work on Linear B, for Meiklejohn, was the fact that no one had been able to decipher Linear A, even after a century of study. The best puzzles of all were the ones that had no answer key\u2014the ones for which no one even knew if a solution existed.When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201Cunbreakable\u201D system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\nMEIKLEJOHN SHOWED REAL talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.Considering Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics for the first time, Meiklejohn was intrigued. But when she got home from the hike and began poring over Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper, it immediately became clear to her that Bitcoin\u2019s trade-offs were the exact opposite of the eCash system she knew so well. Fraud was prevented not by a kind of after-the-fact forgery analysis carried out by a bank authority but with an instantaneous check of the blockchain, the unforgeable public record of who possessed every single bitcoin.\nBut that blockchain ledger system came at an enormous privacy cost: In Bitcoin, for good and for ill, everyone was a witness to every payment. Yes, identities behind those payments were obscured by pseudonymous addresses, long strings of between 26 and 35 characters. But to Meiklejohn, this seemed like an inherently dangerous sort of fig leaf to hide behind. Unlike eCash, whose privacy protections offered snoops no hint of revealing information to latch onto, Bitcoin offered an enormous collection of data to analyze. Who could say what sorts of patterns might give away users who thought they were cleverer than those watching them?\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CAnd so as a cryptographer, the natural question was, if you can\u2019t prove it\u2019s private, then what attacks are possible? If you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nThe temptation was more than Meiklejohn could resist. The blockchain, like a massive, undeciphered corpus of an ancient language, hid a wealth of secrets in plain view.\nWHEN MEIKLEJOHN BEGAN digging into the blockchain in late 2012, she started with a very simple question: How many people were using bitcoin?\nThat number was much harder to pin down than it might seem. After downloading the entire blockchain onto a UCSD server and organizing it into a database that she could query, like a gargantuan, searchable spreadsheet, she could see that there were more than 12 million distinct Bitcoin addresses, among which there had been nearly 16 million transactions. But even amid all that activity, there were plenty of recognizable events in Bitcoin\u2019s history visible to the naked eye. Spenders and recipients might have been hidden behind pseudonymous addresses, but some transactions were unmistakable, like distinctive pieces of furniture hidden under thin sheets in someone\u2019s attic.\nShe could see, for instance, the nearly 1 million bitcoins that were mined by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency, before others started using it, as well as the first transaction ever made when Satoshi sent 10 coins as a test to the early Bitcoin developer Hal Finney in January 2009. She spotted, too, the first payment with real value, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz famously sold a friend two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010 (as of this writing worth hundreds of millions of dollars).\nPlenty of other addresses and transactions had been recognized and widely discussed on forums like Bitcointalk, and Meiklejohn spent hours cutting and pasting long strings of characters into Google to see if someone had already claimed credit for an address or if other Bitcoin users had been gossiping about certain high-value transactions. By the time Meiklejohn began to look, anyone with enough interest and patience to wade through a sea of garbled addresses could see money transfers between mysterious parties just beneath the surface of the blockchain\u2019s obfuscation that, even at the time, were often worth small fortunes.Getting beyond that obfuscation, however, was the real challenge. Sure, Meiklejohn could see transactions between addresses. But the problem was drilling down further, definitively drawing a boundary around the bitcoin hoard of any single person or organization. A user could have as many addresses as they chose to create with one of the many wallet programs that managed their coins\u2014like a bank that allows you to spread your wealth across as many accounts as you liked, creating new ones with a mouse click. Plenty of those programs even automatically generated new addresses every time the user received a bitcoin payment, adding to the confusion.\nStill, Meiklejohn was sure that searching for patterns in the mess of transactions would allow her to untangle at least some of them. In Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s own original white paper, Meiklejohn recalled that he had briefly alluded to a technique that could be used to collapse some addresses into single identities. Often, a single bitcoin transaction has multiple \u201Cinputs\u201D from different addresses. If someone wants to pay a friend 10 bitcoins but holds those coins at two different addresses of five coins each, the spender\u2019s wallet software creates a single transaction that lists the two five-coin addresses as inputs and the address receiving 10 coins as the output. To make the payment possible, the payer would need to possess both of the so-called secret keys that allow the five coins at each address to be spent. That means anyone looking at the transaction on the blockchain can reasonably identify both of the input addresses as belonging to the same person or organization.\nSatoshi had hinted at the privacy dangers this introduced. \u201CSome linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,\u201D Satoshi wrote. \u201CThe risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.\u201D\nSo, as Meiklejohn\u2019s first step, she simply tried the technique Satoshi had inadvertently suggested\u2014across every bitcoin payment ever carried out. She scanned her blockchain database for every multi-input transaction, linking all of those double, triple, or even hundredfold inputs to single identities. The result immediately reduced the number of potential Bitcoin users from 12 million to date to around 5 million, slicing away more than half of the problem.\nMeiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked.\nOnly after that initial step\u2014practically a freebie\u2014did Meiklejohn switch her brain into true puzzle-solving mode. Like a 20th-century archaeologist scanning hieroglyphics for identifiable words or phrases that might help to decipher a passage of text, she began to hunt through Bitcoin\u2019s transactions for other clues that might reveal identifying information. Messing around with bitcoin wallets\u2014making test payments to herself and her colleagues\u2014she began to understand a quirk of the cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin wallets only allowed spenders to pay the entire amount of coins sitting at a certain address. Each address was like a piggy bank that has to be smashed open to spend the coins inside. Spend less than the whole amount in that piggy bank and the leftovers have to be stored in a newly created piggy bank.\nThis second piggy bank, in Bitcoin\u2019s system, is called a \u201Cchange\u201D address: When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient\u2019s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn\u2019t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address\u2014a piggy bank that had materialized on the spot to receive leftover coins from the one that had just been shattered. And that meant these two piggy banks\u2014the spender\u2019s address and the change address\u2014must belong to the same person.\nMeiklejohn began to apply that change-making lens, looking for instances where she could link spenders and the remainders of their payments. She began to see how powerful the simple act of tracking bitcoin change could be: In instances where she couldn\u2019t distinguish a recipient address from a change address, she would be stuck at a fork in the road with no signposts. But if she could link change addresses to the addresses they had split off from, she could make her own signposts. She could follow the money despite its branching paths.\nThe result was that Meiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked: A single sum of coins would move from change address to change address as the spender paid fractions of the total pile of coins in one small payment after another. The remainder of the pile might move to a fresh address with each payment, but those addresses must all represent the transactions of a single spender.\nShe\u2019d come to refer to those chains of transactions as \u201Cpeeling chains\u201D (or sometimes just \u201Cpeel chains\u201D). She thought of them like someone peeling bills off a roll of dollar bills: Though the roll of bills might be put back in a different pocket after a bill was peeled off and spent, it was still fundamentally one wad of cash with a consistent owner. Following these peeling chains opened avenues to trace the digital money\u2019s movements like never before.\nMeiklejohn now had two clever techniques, both of which were capable of linking multiple Bitcoin addresses to a single person or organization, what she came to call \u201Cclustering.\u201D What had initially looked like disparate addresses could now be connected into clusters that encompassed hundreds or, in some cases, even thousands of addresses.\nAlready, she was tracing bitcoins in ways that many of the cryptocurrency\u2019s users wouldn\u2019t have believed possible. But following coins didn\u2019t necessarily mean understanding who owned them. The identities behind those coins remained a mystery, and each of her clusters remained just as pseudonymous as the single, disconnected addresses had been originally. To put a name to those clusters, she began to realize, she\u2019d have to take a much more hands-on approach: not simply observing the artifacts of the Bitcoin economy after the fact like an archaeologist, but becoming a player in it herself\u2014in some cases, an undercover one.\nSEARCHING FOR GUIDANCE in her budding Bitcoin research, Meiklejohn turned to Stefan Savage, a UCSD professor who was on the other end of the spectrum from the deeply mathematical cryptography research Meiklejohn had spent years on. Savage was a hands-on, empirical researcher, more interested in real-world experiments with real-world results than abstractions. He had been one of the lead advisers of a now-legendary team of researchers who had first shown it was possible to hack a car over the internet, demonstrating to General Motors in 2011 that his team could remotely take over a Chevy Impala\u2019s steering and brakes via the cellular radio in its OnStar system, a shocking feat of hacker wizardry.More recently, Savage had helped lead a group that included Kirill Levchenko\u2014the scientist who\u2019d introduced Meiklejohn to Bitcoin on their desert hike\u2014working on a massively ambitious project to track the spam email ecosystem. In that research, as with the earlier car-hacking breakthrough, Savage\u2019s team hadn\u2019t been afraid to get their hands dirty: They\u2019d collected hundreds of millions of web links in junk marketing emails, mostly ones intended to sell real and fake pharmaceuticals. Then, as Savage describes it, they acted out the role of \u201Cthe world\u2019s most gullible person,\u201D using bots to click through on every one of those links to see where they led and spending more than $50,000 on the products the spammers were hawking\u2014all while working with a cooperative credit card issuer to trace the funds and see which banks ended up with the money.\nSeveral of those shady banks were ultimately shut down as a result of the researchers\u2019 tracing work. As another UCSD professor working on the project, Geoffrey Voelker, described it at the time, \u201COur secret weapon is shopping.\u201D\nSo when Meiklejohn began talking over her Bitcoin tracking project with Savage, the two agreed she should take the same approach: She would manually identify Bitcoin addresses one by one by doing transactions with them herself, like a cop on the narcotics beat carrying out buy-and-busts.\nThat\u2019s how Meiklejohn found herself in the early weeks of 2013 ordering coffee, cupcakes, trading cards, mugs, baseball hats, silver coins, socks, and a closet\u2019s worth of other truly random objects from online vendors who accepted bitcoin; joining more than a dozen mining collectives; fiendishly gambling bitcoins at every online crypto casino she could find; and moving bitcoins into and out of accounts on practically every existing bitcoin exchange\u2014and the Silk Road\u2014again and again.\nThe hundreds of addresses Meiklejohn identified and tagged manually with those 344 transactions represented only the tiniest fraction of the overall bitcoin landscape. But when she combined her address tagging with her chaining and clustering techniques, many of those tags suddenly identified not just a single address but an enormous cluster belonging to the same owner. With just a few hundred tags, she had put an identity to more than a million of Bitcoin\u2019s once-pseudonymous addresses.\nA chart from Meiklejohn\u2019s paper showing her \u201Cclustering\u201D of Bitcoin addresses for early cryptocurrency entities.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNWith just the 30 addresses she had identified by moving coins into and out of Mt. Gox, for instance, she could now link more than 500,000 addresses to the exchange. And based on just four deposits and seven withdrawals into wallets on the Silk Road, she was able to identify nearly 300,000 of the black market\u2019s addresses. This breakthrough didn\u2019t mean Meiklejohn could identify any actual users of the Silk Road by name, nor could she unmask, of course, the mysterious kingpin of that site, the ultra libertarian Dread Pirate Roberts. But it would directly contradict DPR\u2019s claims to me that his Bitcoin \u201Ctumbler\u201D system could prevent observers from even seeing when users moved cryptocurrency into and out of their Silk Road accounts.\nWhen Meiklejohn brought her results back to Savage, her adviser was impressed. But as they began to plan to publish a paper on her findings, he wanted a concrete demonstration for readers, not a bunch of arcane statistics. \u201CWe need to show people,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers him saying, \u201Cwhat these techniques can actually do.\u201D\nSo Meiklejohn went a step further: She began to look for specific bitcoin transactions she could track\u2014particularly criminal ones.\nAS MEIKLEJOHN HAD trawled cryptocurrency forums for discussions of interesting addresses worth scrutinizing, one mysterious mountain of money in particular stood out: This single address had, over the course of 2012, accumulated 613,326 bitcoins\u20145 percent of all the coins in circulation. It represented around $7.5 million at the time, a figure nowhere near the billions it would represent today, but a heady sum nonetheless. Rumors among Bitcoin users suggested that the hoard was possibly a Silk Road wallet, or perhaps the result of an unrelated, notorious Bitcoin Ponzi scheme carried out by a user known as pirate@40.\nMeiklejohn couldn\u2019t say which of the two rumors might be correct. But with her clustering techniques, she could now follow that giant sum of cryptocurrency. She saw that after conspicuously gathering at one address, the pile of money had been broken up in late 2012 and sent on forking paths around the blockchain. Meiklejohn\u2019s understanding of peel chains meant she could now trace those sums of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as they split, distinguishing the amount that remained in the control of the initial owner from the smaller sums that were peeled off in subsequent payments. Eventually, several of those peel chains led to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, where they seemed to be cashed out for traditional currency. For an academic researcher, this was a dead end. But anyone with the subpoena power of law enforcement, Meiklejohn realized, could very likely force those exchanges to hand over information about the accounts behind those transactions and solve the mystery of the $7.5 million stash.\nFar from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\nLooking for more coins to hunt, Meiklejohn turned her focus to another sort of dirty money. Large-scale cryptocurrency heists were, in early 2013, a growing epidemic. After all, bitcoin was like cash or gold. Anyone who stole a Bitcoin address\u2019s secret key could empty out that address like a digital safe. Unlike with credit cards or other digital payment systems, there was no overseer who could stop or reverse the money\u2019s movement. That had made every bitcoin business and its stash of crypto revenue a ripe target for hackers, especially if the holders of those funds made the mistake of storing their secret keys on internet-connected computers\u2014the equivalent of carrying six- or seven-figure sums of cash in their pockets while strolling through a dangerous neighborhood.\nMeiklejohn found a thread on Bitcointalk that listed addresses of many of the biggest, most conspicuous crypto thefts in recent memory, and she began to follow the money. Looking at a robbery of 3,171 coins from an early bitcoin gambling site, she immediately found she could trace the stolen funds across no fewer than ten hops, from address to address, before different branches of the money were cashed out at exchanges. Another theft of 18,500 bitcoins from the exchange Bitcoinica similarly led her along a winding series of peel chains that ended at three other exchanges, where the robbers were no doubt cashing in their ill-gotten gains. Sitting in front of Meiklejohn, on her screen, was a bonanza of leads, each just waiting for any actual criminal investigator with a handful of subpoenas to follow them.Now, when Meiklejohn showed Savage her results, he agreed: They were ready to publish.\nIn the final draft of the paper Meiklejohn and her coauthors put together, they definitively stated conclusions\u2014based for the first time on solid, empirical evidence\u2014that flew in the face of what many Bitcoin users believed at the time: Far from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\n\u201CEven our relatively small experiment demonstrates that this approach can shed considerable light on the structure of the Bitcoin economy, how it is used, and those organizations who are party to it,\u201D the paper read. \u201CWe demonstrate that an agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the public nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary flows to major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.\u201D\nHaving set down those words, and blowing a gaping hole in the myth of Bitcoin\u2019s inherent untraceability, Meiklejohn, Savage, and her other adviser Geoffrey Voelker started brainstorming a clever title. In an homage to the Wild West of the economy they were chronicling\u2014and her advisers\u2019 mutual love of spaghetti Westerns\u2014they started with the phrase \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins,\u201D an allusion to the 1960s Clint Eastwood classic A Fistful of Dollars. They settled on a subtitle that evoked both Eastwood\u2019s most famous cowboy vigilante and the world of shadowy figures their nascent techniques could unmask. When the UCSD paper hit the internet in August 2013, it was introduced with a description that, to those involved, had come to seem inevitable: \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.\u201D\nIn the new era of cryptocurrency tracing that would follow Meiklejohn\u2019s work, they wouldn\u2019t remain nameless for long.\nAdapted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency.

His defense team says it will appeal, saying the crypto-tracing technique at the heart of the case is \u201Cpseudoscience.\u201D","post_content":"On March 12, Russian-Swedish national Roman Sterlingov was found guilty of money laundering conspiracy and other violations by a federal jury in Washington, DC, for having operated Bitcoin Fog, a service criminals used to launder what authorities claim was hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.\nThe conviction was heralded by the US Department of Justice as a victory over crypto-enabled criminality, but Sterlingov\u2019s lawyers maintain the case against him was flawed and plan to appeal. They allege that the nascent science used to collect evidence against him is not fit for the purpose.\nThe DOJ investigation used blockchain forensics, a technique whereby investigators scrutinize the public trail of crypto transactions to map the flow of funds. In a statement, Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general for the US, described the DOJ as \u201Cpainstakingly tracing bitcoin through the blockchain\u201D to identify Sterlingov as the pseudonymous administrator behind Bitcoin Fog.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acquired an undeserved reputation for being less traceable than conventional money, but evidence collected this way has brought down many criminals over the past decade. Blockchain forensics was crucial to the trial of Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous Silk Road marketplace. But in the Bitcoin Fog case, the defense has pulled this investigative technique into the spotlight, effectively putting crypto tracing on trial in place of their client. The case is a \u201Cfirst-of-its-kind,\u201D says Tor Ekeland, legal counsel to Sterlingov. \u201CNobody has challenged blockchain forensics before, because it\u2019s brand-new.\u201D\nBefore Sterlingov\u2019s trial, his attorneys asked the presiding judge to determine the admissibility of evidence from blockchain forensics experts that had used software from a firm called Chainalysis, which expedites the otherwise tedious process of sifting through the blockchain. He ruled the evidence was admissible.\nThat decision has been characterized by Michael Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, as an endorsement of his firm and its methods. \u201CWe are now the only company in the world with a stamp of approval for our ability to look at a blockchain and create evidence,\u201D he says. But Ekeland says he will work with Sterlingov to appeal both the guilty verdict and the judge\u2019s ruling on the validity of blockchain forensics. The conviction of Sterlingov is the latest example of the unhappy phenomenon, claims Ekeland, whereby \u201Cnewly emergent junk science leads to unjust verdicts.\u201D\nBeth Bisbee of Chainalysis, formerly the company\u2019s head of US investigations, disputes that characterization. \u201CThe evidence that the government presented to the jury demonstrated the exact opposite,\u201D says Bisbee, who testified as an expert witness at the trial. \u201COur methods are transparent, tested, reviewed, and reliable.\u201D\nNatsec Threat\nUntil it was shut down by US law enforcement in 2021, Bitcoin Fog supplied what's known as a crypto mixing or crypto tumbling service. Funds belonging to many parties are pooled, jumbled up, and spat out into brand-new wallets, masking the origin of the coins held in each. Mixers were originally promoted as a way to improve the level of privacy cryptocurrency could afford consumers, but they have been readily co-opted for the purpose of money laundering. Bitcoin Fog was among the first mixers to emerge, in 2011, making it \u201Cthe longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet,\u201D the DOJ says.\nIn the past few years, the US government has cracked down on crypto mixers, which it considers a threat to national security. After taking down Bitcoin Fog, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, another mixer, in 2022. The year after, it took down another, ChipMixer, and charged the founder with money laundering. To identify the individuals behind these operations, investigators had to follow the crypto money.In crypto\u2019s earliest years, the pseudonymous nature of transactions\u2014whereby coins are exchanged between wallets identified only by an alphanumeric address\u2014was frequently mistaken for anonymity. But beginning in late 2012 with the work of cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn, now a professor at University College London, among others, researchers began to figure out ways to group crypto wallets together, revealing connections that implied shared ownership. \u201CUltimately, you\u2019re trying to link one pile of money to another,\u201D says Meiklejohn. With this new knowledge, it became possible to attribute wallets to specific crypto exchanges or marketplaces, and to follow stolen funds. To identify the people who owned particular wallets, law enforcement could subpoena the exchanges they used to convert crypto into regular money. Logged on an open ledger for all to see, crypto transactions were not remotely anonymous.\nThis general methodology\u2014which Meiklejohn termed \u201Cclustering\u201D\u2014was taken up, further developed, and packaged into blockchain forensics services offered by firms like Chainalysis, which was used by the DOJ to help prosecute Sterlingov. \u201CIn academia, we are pretty far behind the state of the art at this point,\u201D says Meiklejohn. \u201CWe sort of accept that this is just an industry now.\u201D\nThe professionalization of blockchain forensics is central to Sterlingov\u2019s defense strategy in the Bitcoin Fog case. It is impossible to audit the clustering performed by the government for accuracy, a report commissioned by the defense submitted ahead of the trial claimed, because the inner workings of Chainalysis\u2019 software are private. There has been no peer review of the specific methodology the company uses, says Ekeland, nor is there any standards body for the blockchain forensics industry. \u201CIt should be illegal to use black box software in criminal prosecutions\u2014it should be open source. It violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront their accuser. It\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201D he claims. Chainalysis says the hearings on the admissibility of the company\u2019s evidence served as a check on its reliability.\n\u201CMushrooming Effect\u201D\nThe defense also disputes the way in which blockchain forensics evidence was interpreted, to finger Sterlingov as the operator of Bitcoin Fog. Although wallets belonging to Sterlingov might have interacted with the mixer, that does not prove him the service\u2019s operator, they argue. \u201CThe problem isn\u2019t so much that the blockchain is lying,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CThe flow of funds is not the same as the flow of control.\u201D\nWhile the government presented other forms of evidence it said tied Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog, like analysis of IP addresses linking him to the ownership of the web domain, Ekeland believes the blockchain forensics was critical in convincing the jury of his guilt. \u201CThe \u2018CSI effect\u2019 really hurt us,\u201D he says. \u201CThe jury placed undue importance on pseudoscientific evidence, because it was presented in a fancy chart and by the government.\u201D\nThe academics with whom the science of crypto tracing originated acknowledge that it should not be applied as evidence in isolation, or mischaracterized as some sort of a smoking gun. There remains some art to interpreting the information produced by blockchain analysis, says Meiklejohn, which introduces the opportunity for error. \u201CYou still have to decide if it means what you think it means, or whether there are other explanations,\u201D she says.\u201CI would not be comfortable [with blockchain forensics being the only form of evidence],\u201D says Philip Koshy, who alongside his wife Diana Koshy demonstrated in 2014 a way to identify the IP addresses associated with certain bitcoin transactions. \u201CIt ends up becoming scientific only if you can determine ground truth, using subpoena power.\u201D\nThe judge in the Sterlingov case pointed out in his ruling on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence that the DOJ had additional evidence pointing to the accused. \u201CThis is not a case in which the government\u2019s theory that Sterlingov was the operator of Bitcoin Fog turns exclusively, or even primarily, [on blockchain forensics],\u201D he wrote. In order to \u201Cestablish that crucial point,\u201D the judge noted, the government relied upon a range of information external to any blockchain, from IP addresses to forum posts.\nThe judge also took issue with the depiction of Chainalysis software as an inscrutable black box, on the grounds that the defense had been given information about its workings\u2014Ekeland disputes this characterization\u2014and pointed out that the underlying heuristics applied by the firm have been subject to peer review, even if its specific clustering methods have not been.\nFor maximum transparency, Chainalysis could open-source its software, but doing so would risk handing an advantage to bad actors. \u201CThis is a cat and mouse game,\u201D says Mieklejohn. \u201COnce you publish the heuristics, people understand how they work, and then they can take steps to evade those heuristics.\u201D In the circumstances, argues Gronager, Chainalysis CEO, the hearings on admissibility\u2014during which the company\u2019s work came under heavy scrutiny\u2014is the next best thing to a traditional peer review.\nIn the end, the effort to cast doubt over the reliability of blockchain forensics bore no fruit for the defense. \u201CThe Court is persuaded that blockchain analytics in general, and [Chainalysis\u2019 software] in particular, is not junk science,\u201D wrote the judge, in his summation on the admissibility question.\nThe ruling does not set a precedent that other US judges must follow, because the case has been confined so far to a district court. Nonetheless, Gronager is hopeful it will be the \u201Cfinal word\u201D on the admissibility of blockchain forensics evidence, at least until future developments in crypto tracing demand a reevaluation. \u201CThis is a landmark ruling,\u201D adds Bisbee of Chainalysis.\nWhile Ekeland is concerned about a \u201Cmushrooming effect,\u201D whereby the ruling will figure in the thinking of future judges, he claims the matter \u201Ccould take years to gel one way or the other.\u201D Among other quarrels with the way the case was tried, the use of blockchain forensic evidence will form part of the basis for Sterlingov\u2019s appeal. \u201CRight now, the momentum is in their favor,\u201D says Ekeland. \u201CBut it\u2019s still an open battlefield.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6603759fd3a75d0aa76d16ab\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_tracing_forensics_trial.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"The Science of Crypto Forensics Survives a Court Battle\u2014for Now","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-science-of-crypto-forensics-court-battle\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRYPTOCURRENCIES","CRIME","DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE","MONEY","FINANCE"]},{"date":"01.26.2024","summary":"In his new book Read Write Own, investor Chris Dixon mounts a defense of blockchain, arguing it can save society from the monopoly power of tech giants.","post_content":"A survey of headlines from the past couple of years in the cryptocurrency industry might lead anyone to believe that it is a deeply unserious business.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65b31346997eb849e52195f0\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_crypto_blockchain_save_future.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A Last-Ditch Plan to Save the Crypto Industry","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/a-last-ditch-plan-to-save-the-crypto-industry\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","INVESTING","VENTURE CAPITAL","FTX TRIAL","INTERNET CULTURE","ANTITRUST"]},{"date":"05.01.2024","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model\u2014and the 200-million-transaction dataset it's trained on\u2014that aims to spot the \u201Cshape\u201D of bitcoin money laundering.","post_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can't see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

But clues left across blockchains over the past year suggested instead that external thieves had chosen a particularly inconvenient moment during FTX's meltdown to pull off an enormous heist.\nNow, new clues revealed in a US Department of Justice indictment suggest something even more surprising: Some of those suspected thieves appear to have been in the United States and have now been arrested.\nAn indictment filed last week details charges against three people\u2014Robert Powell, Carter Rohn, and Emily Hernandez\u2014who are accused of running a massive cybercriminal theft ring. The group, which authorities say was known as the \u201CPowell SIM Swapping Crew,\u201D allegedly used SIM swaps\u2014tricking phone companies into switching a user's mobile phone registration to the thieves' SIM card so that they can gain access to authentication codes sent to the victim's phone\u2014to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from victims' accounts.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nMost notably, the gang is accused of siphoning $400 million in virtual currency from the accounts of a company\u2014named in the indictment only as Victim Company-1\u2014on the night of November 11, 2022, continuing into November 12. As first spotted by cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, that is also the exact timing of FTX's theft, which the company itself has pegged at between $415 million and $432 million in stolen crypto.\nThe blockchain analysis firm Elliptic corroborated Krebs' inference that the $400 million theft described in the report is almost certainly the FTX heist. \u201CWe are not aware of any other thefts from crypto businesses on this scale, on these dates,\u201D Elliptic wrote in a blog post. \u201CIt therefore appears likely that FTX is the \u2018Victim Company-1\u2019 named in the indictment.\u201D\nFTX didn't immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment on whether it is the SIM-swapping victim described in the indictment.\nIf the indictment does, in fact, describe the FTX theft\u2014and given the relative rarity of nine-figure crypto thefts and the exact timing of this one\u2014then the charging document reveals key details about how the FTX heist was pulled off. It describes how Powell allegedly asked Hernandez to target a specific phone number for SIM-swapping. According to prosecutors, Hernandez then obtained a fake ID with her photo but the name of her victim\u2014potentially an FTX staffer\u2014and presented it at an AT&T retail store in Texas to prove her identity as she requested that the staffer's account be transferred to her own phone.\nThat allowed the group to hijack messages intended for the victim, including authentication codes for his or her account, according to the indictment. Given that those codes usually represent a second-factor authentication mechanism required after a user enters their username and password, it\u2019s not clear how those other credentials might have been stolen, though cybercriminals typically obtain them through phishing, credential-stealing malware, or trying credentials leaked in other database dumps and potentially reused across accounts.The possibility that the FTX thieves have been identified as Americans, within reach of US law enforcement, comes as a surprise following Elliptic\u2019s discovery in October of last year that the crypto stolen from FTX had moved across blockchains and through cryptocurrency swapping services in a way that suggested Russia-linked money launderers. Portions of the funds, for instance, moved through mixing services\u2014which take in users\u2019 funds and return others to muddy the trail of any blockchain tracing\u2014that are popular with Russian cybercriminals, such as ChipMixer and Sinbad.\nBoth mixers, in fact, have been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for their illicit use, including by Russian ransomware gangs. \u201CIt\u2019s looking increasingly likely that the perpetrator has links to Russia,\u201D Elliptic\u2019s chief scientist and cofounder Tom Robison told WIRED in October. \u201CWe can\u2019t attribute this to a Russian actor, but it\u2019s an indication it might be.\u201D\nIf the money is FTX's, those blockchain footprints suggest that the $400 million that the hackers allegedly stole is long gone, moved into the hands of international money launderers. \u201CIt is therefore not clear whether any of the stolen assets are under their control, and might be recovered,\u201D Elliptic wrote in its blog post today. Nonetheless, if the alleged hackers were paid a portion of that sum in exchange for their work to steal it, that money might still be seized and repaid as restitution to FTX\u2019s many creditors.\nEither way, it suggests that another mystery in the story of FTX\u2019s implosion and the billions of dollars in missing funds that disappeared with it may be at least partially solved. If so, it would seem this FTX-related crime, at least, can\u2019t be blamed on Sam Bankman-Fried.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65bbff20098d608f3b8b686b\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/FTX-Heist-Security-1244772036.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"The Mystery of the $400 Million FTX Heist May Have Been Solved","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-heist-sim-swat-indictment\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRIME","CYBERATTACKS","BITCOIN"]},{"date":"01.17.2024","summary":"Once, drug dealers and money launderers saw cryptocurrency as perfectly untraceable. Then a grad student named Sarah Meiklejohn proved them all wrong\u2014and set the stage for a decade-long crackdown.","post_content":"JUST OVER A decade ago, Bitcoin appeared to many of its adherents to be the crypto-anarchist holy grail: truly private digital cash for the internet.\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency\u2019s mysterious and unidentifiable inventor, had stated in an email introducing Bitcoin that \u201Cparticipants can be anonymous.\u201D And the Silk Road dark-web drug market seemed like living proof of that potential, enabling the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal drugs and other contraband for bitcoin while flaunting its impunity from law enforcement.\nThis is the story of the revelation in late 2013 that Bitcoin was, in fact, the opposite of untraceable\u2014that its blockchain would actually allow researchers, tech companies, and law enforcement to trace and identify users with even more transparency than the existing financial system. That discovery would upend the world of cybercrime. Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world\u2019s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web\u2019s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nThat 180-degree flip in the world\u2019s understanding of cryptocurrency\u2019s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn\u2019s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer\u2019s mining power to 11 different mining \u201Cpools,\u201D groups that collected users\u2019 computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\nPHOTOGRAPH: PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nWalmart\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\nMeiklejohn\u2019s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists\u2019 idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous.\nA collage from Meiklejohn\u2019s research paper showing every object she bought with Bitcoin in her tracing experiments.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNAS MEIKLEJOHN PAINSTAKINGLY fiddled with bitcoins and watched the digital trails they created, she found herself having flashbacks to a particular day, decades earlier, in her mother\u2019s downtown Manhattan office. That morning, Meiklejohn and her mother had taken the subway together, all the way from their Upper West Side apartment near the American Museum of Natural History to the federal building at Foley Square, across from the city\u2019s intimidating, stone-columned courthouses.\nMeiklejohn was still in elementary school, but it was take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Meiklejohn\u2019s mother was a federal prosecutor. Over the years that followed, the elder Meiklejohn would make her career taking on contractors who were bilking the city government out of tax dollars\u2014bribing government staffers to choose overpriced school food or street-paving services\u2014or else banks colluding to sell low-performing investments to the city\u2019s financiers. Many of her targets in those corruption probes would be sentenced to years in prison.\nThat day in the Justice Department\u2019s New York office, Sarah Meiklejohn, not yet 10 years old, was put to work. She was assigned to comb through a pile of paper checks, searching for clues of a corrupt kickback scheme in one of her mother\u2019s investigations.\nIt was that feeling, the drive to manually assemble tiny data points that built into a larger picture, that would give Meiklejohn a kind of déjà vu 20 years later as she studied the Bitcoin blockchain, even before she consciously knew what she was doing.\n\u201CSomewhere in the back of my mind was this idea,\u201D says Meiklejohn, \u201Cthe idea of following the money.\u201D\nAs a child, Meiklejohn loved puzzles\u2014the more complex, the better. On road trips, in airports, or any other time the small-for-her-age, hyper-inquisitive girl needed to be distracted, her mother would hand her a book of puzzles. One of the first websites Meiklejohn remembers visiting on the nascent World Wide Web was a GeoCities page devoted to deciphering the Kryptos sculpture on the campus of the CIA, whose copper, ribbonlike surface contained four coded messages that even the cryptanalysts at Langley hadn\u2019t been able to crack. By the age of 14 she would finish the New York Times crossword puzzle every day of the week.\nOn a vacation to London, Meiklejohn\u2019s family visited the British Museum, and Meiklejohn became fixated on the Rosetta stone, along with the broader notion of ancient languages\u2014the remnants of entire cultures\u2014that could be deciphered if the puzzler simply found the right key. Soon she was reading about Linear A and Linear B, a pair of written scripts used by the Minoan civilization on Crete until roughly 1500 BC. Linear B had been deciphered only in the 1950s, thanks in large part to a classicist at Brooklyn College named Alice Kober who labored in obscurity over samples of the Bronze Age language for 20 years, writing her notes on 180,000 index cards.\nMeiklejohn became so obsessed with Linear A and B that she persuaded a teacher at her middle school to organize an evening seminar on the subject (only she and one friend attended). More tantalizing than even the story of Alice Kober\u2019s work on Linear B, for Meiklejohn, was the fact that no one had been able to decipher Linear A, even after a century of study. The best puzzles of all were the ones that had no answer key\u2014the ones for which no one even knew if a solution existed.When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201Cunbreakable\u201D system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\nMEIKLEJOHN SHOWED REAL talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.Considering Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics for the first time, Meiklejohn was intrigued. But when she got home from the hike and began poring over Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper, it immediately became clear to her that Bitcoin\u2019s trade-offs were the exact opposite of the eCash system she knew so well. Fraud was prevented not by a kind of after-the-fact forgery analysis carried out by a bank authority but with an instantaneous check of the blockchain, the unforgeable public record of who possessed every single bitcoin.\nBut that blockchain ledger system came at an enormous privacy cost: In Bitcoin, for good and for ill, everyone was a witness to every payment. Yes, identities behind those payments were obscured by pseudonymous addresses, long strings of between 26 and 35 characters. But to Meiklejohn, this seemed like an inherently dangerous sort of fig leaf to hide behind. Unlike eCash, whose privacy protections offered snoops no hint of revealing information to latch onto, Bitcoin offered an enormous collection of data to analyze. Who could say what sorts of patterns might give away users who thought they were cleverer than those watching them?\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CAnd so as a cryptographer, the natural question was, if you can\u2019t prove it\u2019s private, then what attacks are possible? If you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nThe temptation was more than Meiklejohn could resist. The blockchain, like a massive, undeciphered corpus of an ancient language, hid a wealth of secrets in plain view.\nWHEN MEIKLEJOHN BEGAN digging into the blockchain in late 2012, she started with a very simple question: How many people were using bitcoin?\nThat number was much harder to pin down than it might seem. After downloading the entire blockchain onto a UCSD server and organizing it into a database that she could query, like a gargantuan, searchable spreadsheet, she could see that there were more than 12 million distinct Bitcoin addresses, among which there had been nearly 16 million transactions. But even amid all that activity, there were plenty of recognizable events in Bitcoin\u2019s history visible to the naked eye. Spenders and recipients might have been hidden behind pseudonymous addresses, but some transactions were unmistakable, like distinctive pieces of furniture hidden under thin sheets in someone\u2019s attic.\nShe could see, for instance, the nearly 1 million bitcoins that were mined by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency, before others started using it, as well as the first transaction ever made when Satoshi sent 10 coins as a test to the early Bitcoin developer Hal Finney in January 2009. She spotted, too, the first payment with real value, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz famously sold a friend two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010 (as of this writing worth hundreds of millions of dollars).\nPlenty of other addresses and transactions had been recognized and widely discussed on forums like Bitcointalk, and Meiklejohn spent hours cutting and pasting long strings of characters into Google to see if someone had already claimed credit for an address or if other Bitcoin users had been gossiping about certain high-value transactions. By the time Meiklejohn began to look, anyone with enough interest and patience to wade through a sea of garbled addresses could see money transfers between mysterious parties just beneath the surface of the blockchain\u2019s obfuscation that, even at the time, were often worth small fortunes.Getting beyond that obfuscation, however, was the real challenge. Sure, Meiklejohn could see transactions between addresses. But the problem was drilling down further, definitively drawing a boundary around the bitcoin hoard of any single person or organization. A user could have as many addresses as they chose to create with one of the many wallet programs that managed their coins\u2014like a bank that allows you to spread your wealth across as many accounts as you liked, creating new ones with a mouse click. Plenty of those programs even automatically generated new addresses every time the user received a bitcoin payment, adding to the confusion.\nStill, Meiklejohn was sure that searching for patterns in the mess of transactions would allow her to untangle at least some of them. In Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s own original white paper, Meiklejohn recalled that he had briefly alluded to a technique that could be used to collapse some addresses into single identities. Often, a single bitcoin transaction has multiple \u201Cinputs\u201D from different addresses. If someone wants to pay a friend 10 bitcoins but holds those coins at two different addresses of five coins each, the spender\u2019s wallet software creates a single transaction that lists the two five-coin addresses as inputs and the address receiving 10 coins as the output. To make the payment possible, the payer would need to possess both of the so-called secret keys that allow the five coins at each address to be spent. That means anyone looking at the transaction on the blockchain can reasonably identify both of the input addresses as belonging to the same person or organization.\nSatoshi had hinted at the privacy dangers this introduced. \u201CSome linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,\u201D Satoshi wrote. \u201CThe risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.\u201D\nSo, as Meiklejohn\u2019s first step, she simply tried the technique Satoshi had inadvertently suggested\u2014across every bitcoin payment ever carried out. She scanned her blockchain database for every multi-input transaction, linking all of those double, triple, or even hundredfold inputs to single identities. The result immediately reduced the number of potential Bitcoin users from 12 million to date to around 5 million, slicing away more than half of the problem.\nMeiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked.\nOnly after that initial step\u2014practically a freebie\u2014did Meiklejohn switch her brain into true puzzle-solving mode. Like a 20th-century archaeologist scanning hieroglyphics for identifiable words or phrases that might help to decipher a passage of text, she began to hunt through Bitcoin\u2019s transactions for other clues that might reveal identifying information. Messing around with bitcoin wallets\u2014making test payments to herself and her colleagues\u2014she began to understand a quirk of the cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin wallets only allowed spenders to pay the entire amount of coins sitting at a certain address. Each address was like a piggy bank that has to be smashed open to spend the coins inside. Spend less than the whole amount in that piggy bank and the leftovers have to be stored in a newly created piggy bank.\nThis second piggy bank, in Bitcoin\u2019s system, is called a \u201Cchange\u201D address: When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient\u2019s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn\u2019t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address\u2014a piggy bank that had materialized on the spot to receive leftover coins from the one that had just been shattered. And that meant these two piggy banks\u2014the spender\u2019s address and the change address\u2014must belong to the same person.\nMeiklejohn began to apply that change-making lens, looking for instances where she could link spenders and the remainders of their payments. She began to see how powerful the simple act of tracking bitcoin change could be: In instances where she couldn\u2019t distinguish a recipient address from a change address, she would be stuck at a fork in the road with no signposts. But if she could link change addresses to the addresses they had split off from, she could make her own signposts. She could follow the money despite its branching paths.\nThe result was that Meiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked: A single sum of coins would move from change address to change address as the spender paid fractions of the total pile of coins in one small payment after another. The remainder of the pile might move to a fresh address with each payment, but those addresses must all represent the transactions of a single spender.\nShe\u2019d come to refer to those chains of transactions as \u201Cpeeling chains\u201D (or sometimes just \u201Cpeel chains\u201D). She thought of them like someone peeling bills off a roll of dollar bills: Though the roll of bills might be put back in a different pocket after a bill was peeled off and spent, it was still fundamentally one wad of cash with a consistent owner. Following these peeling chains opened avenues to trace the digital money\u2019s movements like never before.\nMeiklejohn now had two clever techniques, both of which were capable of linking multiple Bitcoin addresses to a single person or organization, what she came to call \u201Cclustering.\u201D What had initially looked like disparate addresses could now be connected into clusters that encompassed hundreds or, in some cases, even thousands of addresses.\nAlready, she was tracing bitcoins in ways that many of the cryptocurrency\u2019s users wouldn\u2019t have believed possible. But following coins didn\u2019t necessarily mean understanding who owned them. The identities behind those coins remained a mystery, and each of her clusters remained just as pseudonymous as the single, disconnected addresses had been originally. To put a name to those clusters, she began to realize, she\u2019d have to take a much more hands-on approach: not simply observing the artifacts of the Bitcoin economy after the fact like an archaeologist, but becoming a player in it herself\u2014in some cases, an undercover one.\nSEARCHING FOR GUIDANCE in her budding Bitcoin research, Meiklejohn turned to Stefan Savage, a UCSD professor who was on the other end of the spectrum from the deeply mathematical cryptography research Meiklejohn had spent years on. Savage was a hands-on, empirical researcher, more interested in real-world experiments with real-world results than abstractions. He had been one of the lead advisers of a now-legendary team of researchers who had first shown it was possible to hack a car over the internet, demonstrating to General Motors in 2011 that his team could remotely take over a Chevy Impala\u2019s steering and brakes via the cellular radio in its OnStar system, a shocking feat of hacker wizardry.More recently, Savage had helped lead a group that included Kirill Levchenko\u2014the scientist who\u2019d introduced Meiklejohn to Bitcoin on their desert hike\u2014working on a massively ambitious project to track the spam email ecosystem. In that research, as with the earlier car-hacking breakthrough, Savage\u2019s team hadn\u2019t been afraid to get their hands dirty: They\u2019d collected hundreds of millions of web links in junk marketing emails, mostly ones intended to sell real and fake pharmaceuticals. Then, as Savage describes it, they acted out the role of \u201Cthe world\u2019s most gullible person,\u201D using bots to click through on every one of those links to see where they led and spending more than $50,000 on the products the spammers were hawking\u2014all while working with a cooperative credit card issuer to trace the funds and see which banks ended up with the money.\nSeveral of those shady banks were ultimately shut down as a result of the researchers\u2019 tracing work. As another UCSD professor working on the project, Geoffrey Voelker, described it at the time, \u201COur secret weapon is shopping.\u201D\nSo when Meiklejohn began talking over her Bitcoin tracking project with Savage, the two agreed she should take the same approach: She would manually identify Bitcoin addresses one by one by doing transactions with them herself, like a cop on the narcotics beat carrying out buy-and-busts.\nThat\u2019s how Meiklejohn found herself in the early weeks of 2013 ordering coffee, cupcakes, trading cards, mugs, baseball hats, silver coins, socks, and a closet\u2019s worth of other truly random objects from online vendors who accepted bitcoin; joining more than a dozen mining collectives; fiendishly gambling bitcoins at every online crypto casino she could find; and moving bitcoins into and out of accounts on practically every existing bitcoin exchange\u2014and the Silk Road\u2014again and again.\nThe hundreds of addresses Meiklejohn identified and tagged manually with those 344 transactions represented only the tiniest fraction of the overall bitcoin landscape. But when she combined her address tagging with her chaining and clustering techniques, many of those tags suddenly identified not just a single address but an enormous cluster belonging to the same owner. With just a few hundred tags, she had put an identity to more than a million of Bitcoin\u2019s once-pseudonymous addresses.\nA chart from Meiklejohn\u2019s paper showing her \u201Cclustering\u201D of Bitcoin addresses for early cryptocurrency entities.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNWith just the 30 addresses she had identified by moving coins into and out of Mt. Gox, for instance, she could now link more than 500,000 addresses to the exchange. And based on just four deposits and seven withdrawals into wallets on the Silk Road, she was able to identify nearly 300,000 of the black market\u2019s addresses. This breakthrough didn\u2019t mean Meiklejohn could identify any actual users of the Silk Road by name, nor could she unmask, of course, the mysterious kingpin of that site, the ultra libertarian Dread Pirate Roberts. But it would directly contradict DPR\u2019s claims to me that his Bitcoin \u201Ctumbler\u201D system could prevent observers from even seeing when users moved cryptocurrency into and out of their Silk Road accounts.\nWhen Meiklejohn brought her results back to Savage, her adviser was impressed. But as they began to plan to publish a paper on her findings, he wanted a concrete demonstration for readers, not a bunch of arcane statistics. \u201CWe need to show people,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers him saying, \u201Cwhat these techniques can actually do.\u201D\nSo Meiklejohn went a step further: She began to look for specific bitcoin transactions she could track\u2014particularly criminal ones.\nAS MEIKLEJOHN HAD trawled cryptocurrency forums for discussions of interesting addresses worth scrutinizing, one mysterious mountain of money in particular stood out: This single address had, over the course of 2012, accumulated 613,326 bitcoins\u20145 percent of all the coins in circulation. It represented around $7.5 million at the time, a figure nowhere near the billions it would represent today, but a heady sum nonetheless. Rumors among Bitcoin users suggested that the hoard was possibly a Silk Road wallet, or perhaps the result of an unrelated, notorious Bitcoin Ponzi scheme carried out by a user known as pirate@40.\nMeiklejohn couldn\u2019t say which of the two rumors might be correct. But with her clustering techniques, she could now follow that giant sum of cryptocurrency. She saw that after conspicuously gathering at one address, the pile of money had been broken up in late 2012 and sent on forking paths around the blockchain. Meiklejohn\u2019s understanding of peel chains meant she could now trace those sums of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as they split, distinguishing the amount that remained in the control of the initial owner from the smaller sums that were peeled off in subsequent payments. Eventually, several of those peel chains led to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, where they seemed to be cashed out for traditional currency. For an academic researcher, this was a dead end. But anyone with the subpoena power of law enforcement, Meiklejohn realized, could very likely force those exchanges to hand over information about the accounts behind those transactions and solve the mystery of the $7.5 million stash.\nFar from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\nLooking for more coins to hunt, Meiklejohn turned her focus to another sort of dirty money. Large-scale cryptocurrency heists were, in early 2013, a growing epidemic. After all, bitcoin was like cash or gold. Anyone who stole a Bitcoin address\u2019s secret key could empty out that address like a digital safe. Unlike with credit cards or other digital payment systems, there was no overseer who could stop or reverse the money\u2019s movement. That had made every bitcoin business and its stash of crypto revenue a ripe target for hackers, especially if the holders of those funds made the mistake of storing their secret keys on internet-connected computers\u2014the equivalent of carrying six- or seven-figure sums of cash in their pockets while strolling through a dangerous neighborhood.\nMeiklejohn found a thread on Bitcointalk that listed addresses of many of the biggest, most conspicuous crypto thefts in recent memory, and she began to follow the money. Looking at a robbery of 3,171 coins from an early bitcoin gambling site, she immediately found she could trace the stolen funds across no fewer than ten hops, from address to address, before different branches of the money were cashed out at exchanges. Another theft of 18,500 bitcoins from the exchange Bitcoinica similarly led her along a winding series of peel chains that ended at three other exchanges, where the robbers were no doubt cashing in their ill-gotten gains. Sitting in front of Meiklejohn, on her screen, was a bonanza of leads, each just waiting for any actual criminal investigator with a handful of subpoenas to follow them.Now, when Meiklejohn showed Savage her results, he agreed: They were ready to publish.\nIn the final draft of the paper Meiklejohn and her coauthors put together, they definitively stated conclusions\u2014based for the first time on solid, empirical evidence\u2014that flew in the face of what many Bitcoin users believed at the time: Far from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\n\u201CEven our relatively small experiment demonstrates that this approach can shed considerable light on the structure of the Bitcoin economy, how it is used, and those organizations who are party to it,\u201D the paper read. \u201CWe demonstrate that an agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the public nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary flows to major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.\u201D\nHaving set down those words, and blowing a gaping hole in the myth of Bitcoin\u2019s inherent untraceability, Meiklejohn, Savage, and her other adviser Geoffrey Voelker started brainstorming a clever title. In an homage to the Wild West of the economy they were chronicling\u2014and her advisers\u2019 mutual love of spaghetti Westerns\u2014they started with the phrase \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins,\u201D an allusion to the 1960s Clint Eastwood classic A Fistful of Dollars. They settled on a subtitle that evoked both Eastwood\u2019s most famous cowboy vigilante and the world of shadowy figures their nascent techniques could unmask. When the UCSD paper hit the internet in August 2013, it was introduced with a description that, to those involved, had come to seem inevitable: \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.\u201D\nIn the new era of cryptocurrency tracing that would follow Meiklejohn\u2019s work, they wouldn\u2019t remain nameless for long.\nAdapted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency.

That combination has proved to be wildly popular, rocketing the total value of stablecoin transactions since 2022 past even that of Bitcoin itself.\nIt turns out, however, that as stablecoins have become popular among legitimate users over the past two years, they were even more popular among a different kind of user: those exploiting them for billions of dollars of international sanctions evasion and scams.\nAs part of its annual crime report, cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis today released new numbers on the disproportionate use of stablecoins for both of those massive categories of illicit crypto transactions over the last year. By analyzing blockchains, Chainalysis determined that stablecoins were used in fully 70 percent of crypto scam transactions in 2023, 83 percent of crypto payments to sanctioned countries like Iran and Russia, and 84 percent of crypto payments to specifically sanctioned individuals and companies. Those numbers far outstrip stablecoins' growing overall use\u2014including for legitimate purposes\u2014which accounted for 59 percent of all cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2023.\nIn total, Chainalysis measured $40 billion in illicit stablecoin transactions in 2022 and 2023 combined. The largest single category of that stablecoin-enabled crime was sanctions evasion. In fact, across all cryptocurrencies, sanctions evasion accounted for more than half of the $24.2 billion in criminal transactions Chainalysis observed in 2023, with stablecoins representing the vast majority of those transactions.\nThe attraction of stablecoins for both sanctioned people and countries, argues Andrew Fierman, Chainalysis' head of sanctions strategy, is that it allows targets of sanctions to circumvent any attempt to deny them a stable currency like the US dollar. \u201CWhether it's an individual located in Iran or a bad guy trying to launder money\u2014either way, there's a benefit to the stability of the US dollar that people are looking to obtain,\u201D Fierman says. \u201CIf you're in a jurisdiction where you don't have access to the US dollar due to sanctions, stablecoins become an interesting play.\u201D\nAs examples, Fierman points to Nobitex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange operating in the sanctioned country of Iran, as well as Garantex, a notorious exchange based in Russia that has been specifically sanctioned for its widespread criminal use. Stablecoin usage on Nobitex outstrips bitcoin by a 9:1 ratio, and on Garantex by a 5:1 ratio, Chainalysis found. That's a stark difference from the roughly 1:1 ratio between stablecoins and bitcoins on a few nonsanctioned mainstream exchanges that Chainalysis checked for comparison.\nADVERTISEMENT\nChainalysis's chart showing the growth in stablecoins as a fraction of the value of total illicit crypto transactions over time.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINALYSISChainalysis concedes that the analysis in its report excludes some cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash that are designed to be harder or impossible to trace with blockchain analysis. It also says it based its numbers on the type of cryptocurrency sent directly to an illicit actor, which may leave out other currencies used in money laundering processes that repeatedly swap one type of cryptocurrency for another to make tracing more difficult.\nChainalysis's findings come on the heels of another report released earlier this week by United Nations researchers on the outsize role of stablecoins in illegal gambling and scam operations across East and Southeast Asia. While Chainalysis declined to break out the value of any particular stablecoin in its findings, the UN report singles out Tether, the most popular stablecoin. The report describes Tether sent through the TRON blockchain-based payment network as the \u201Cpreferred choice for regional cyberfraud operations and money launderers alike due to its stability and the ease, anonymity, and low fees of its transactions.\u201D\n\u201CPig butchering\u201D scams\u2014cons in which scammers typically trick users into sending funds into fraudulent investments\u2014consistently use Tether as the means of bilking victims, says Erin West, a deputy district attorney for California's Santa Clara County and a member of the REACT High Tech Task Force, who has long focused on crypto crime. \u201CIt\u2019s always, always, always Tether. I\u2019ve never heard of pig butchering that isn\u2019t Tether,\u201D says West. \u201CThese scammers can\u2019t risk the volatility of any of the other coins like bitcoin or ether. All they want is to move assets from the victims' hands to their own in the cheapest, easiest way possible.\u201D\nWest says that the high proportion of stablecoin use in sanctions evasion also represents a disturbing trend, given that it undermines a system meant to hold specific countries, individuals, and companies accountable for criminal behavior and violations of international law. \u201CIt's so dangerous,\u201D West says. \u201CIt enables them to have access to the very units of currency that we\u2019re trying to prevent them from accessing. This is exactly what sanctions are meant to stop, and they\u2019re able to bypass it.\u201D\nChainalysis's chart showing how stablecoins dominated cryptocurrency-based sanctions evasion and scams in 2023.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINALYSISWhen WIRED reached out to Tether Holdings\u2014the company that issues the stablecoin that shares its name\u2014it responded in a statement following publication of this article that \u201CTether proactively collaborates with global law enforcement agencies to identify and prevent illicit use of\u201D its cryptocurrency, adding that its \u201Ccommitment to the highest standards of compliance is evident in our efforts to eliminate various forms of criminal activity.\u201D\nTether argued further that it has contributed to freezing the assets of users involved in scams or found to be violating the US Treasury's sanctions lists, and noted that all of its transactions, like many cryptocurrencies, can be publicly observed on blockchains\u2014in other words, the observability that made Chainalysis's report possible. \u201CBetween our active and direct engagement with law enforcement and leveraging the transparent nature of blockchain transactions, individuals attempting to conceal their illicit financial activities face significant risks, as every transaction can be easily traced,\u201D the company's statement reads.\nTether Holdings has more flatly denied other reports of Tether's use in crime and sanctions evasion. It wrote that an October Wall Street Journal article on the subject was based on \u201Chighly erroneous interpretations of data\u201D\u2014though in that case, the company pointed to Chainalysis findings as a more accurate accounting. \u201CThere is simply no evidence that Tether has violated Sanctions laws or the Bank Secrecy Act through inadequate customer due diligence or screening practices,\u201D Tether Holdings wrote in an October 26 blog post addressing the WSJ article.\nIn contrast to most cryptocurrencies, Tether does have the capability to freeze user funds, and it said in the October blog post that since its launch in 2014, it had frozen $835 million in funds deemed to be tied to illicit activities. \u201CTether's ethos revolves around transparency, compliance, and proactive collaboration with relevant authorities worldwide,\u201D the company wrote.\nChainalysis' Fierman says that Tether's efforts to freeze criminal funds are having an impact, and more enforcement could help end stablecoins' exploitation by criminals. \u201CJust as we\u2019ve seen with compliant exchanges dominating more and more of total transaction volumes, illicit activity gets pushed to the fringes,\u201D Fierman says.\nDespite Tether's ability to freeze funds, Chainalysis' data suggests that illicit use of stablecoins has so far dwarfed those seizures. West, the prosecutor, notes that most Tether associated with crime is cashed out for another currency long before anyone identifies it. That means Tether hasn't yet come close to solving the underlying problem.\n\u201CI applaud it. I'm all for it,\u201D West says of Tether's efforts to freeze criminal assets. \u201CBut when we're talking about billions and billions of dollars in assets moving, I just think this is one piece of one piece of the puzzle. There are so many more pieces. And the bad actors are so far ahead of us.\u201D\nUpdated at 9:45 am ET, January 18, 2024, to correctly identify prosecutor Erin West's professional title and at 2:45 pm ET with a statement from Tether Holdings.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"\u2018Stablecoins\u2019 Enabled $40 Billion in Crypto Crime Since 2022","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/stablecoin-sanctions-violations-crypto-crime\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRIME","RUSSIA","IRAN"]},{"date":"11.16.2023","summary":"For some people of color, crypto isn\u2019t in crisis.

The unofficial fifth C is certification\u2014paperwork from an independent authority validating the qualities and authenticity of a stone. Now, however, a UK startup is aiming to bring yet another C into the mix: code.\nOpsydia, a company spun out in 2017 from research conducted at the University of Oxford, is pioneering the laser inscription of near-invisible identifier codes\u2014what it calls \u201Cnano-IDs\u201D\u2014inside diamonds.\nEach nano-ID consists of a series of submicron-size dots that are imprinted a fifth of a millimeter beneath the gem\u2019s surface, the dots forming a numerical code that\u2019s linked to official certification documents or (increasingly) blockchain ledgers.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nCrucially, such an identifier doesn\u2019t come close to registering as the kind of mark that would impact a stone\u2019s quality. Magnification of at least 200X and specifically designed illumination is needed just to spot these subsurface codes. For comparison, specialists in diamond grading laboratories work with between 40X and 80X magnification; a jeweler\u2019s loupe offers considerably less.\n\u201CBecause the dots are under 1 micron in all dimensions, it\u2019s actually incredibly difficult to characterize the kind of physical change that\u2019s there\u2014it\u2019s close to doing nothing at all,\u201D says Lewis Fish, Opsydia\u2019s head of product, pointing to a 5-mm diamond inscribed with a nano-ID. \u201CWe sent that for checking to one of the leading grading laboratories, and they knew the code was there\u2014but they couldn\u2019t find it.\u201D\nUsing lasers to inscribe tiny codes and even logos onto diamonds is not in itself new. Usually placed on the stone\u2019s girdle (a narrow band at the outer perimeter, dividing upper and lower sections), these have been on offer from grading labs and other providers since the 1980s. But the codes\u2019 surface positioning is also their weakness: They can be polished off. Also, once set in a piece of jewelry they may be obscured.\nThe proliferation of laser technology, meanwhile, means that bad actors can inscribe either fake codes\u2014for instance, assigning a serial number wrongly designating a higher quality of stone, or indeed labeling a lab-grown diamond as natural\u2014or counterfeit versions of the logos of official laboratories and institutions.\nDynamite With a Laser Beam\nEach Opsydia nano-ID consists of a series of submicron-sized dots imprinted a fifth of a millimeter beneath the gem\u2019s surface.\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nBy contrast, because Opsydia\u2019s technology\u2014which is packaged up in a piano-size machine supplied to industry players such as jewelry brands, manufacturers, and grading labs at a cost of £400,000 ($524,000)\u2014places the inscription beneath the surface, it is supposedly out of reach of the scammers.The code-writing laser beam itself is focused to extreme precision, using patented technology that Opsydia says is unique worldwide in its capabilities. That means it can overcome the exceptionally high refractive index of diamond: The beam effectively behaves as though the diamond, which would normally send a light wave flying off in myriad directions, isn\u2019t there at all.\nWith laser pulses lasting less than a trillionth of a second, there\u2019s apparently no heat damage. And the near invisibility of the mark means that rather than being hidden in a discreet part of the diamond, it can sit centrally, right under the top of the stone.\n\u201CIf you wanted to remove it, you\u2019d have to recut the stone and lose a huge amount of the value,\u201D says Andrew Rimmer, Opsydia\u2019s CEO. That\u2019s because reducing the top of a diamond, even by the shallow amount needed to cut out the nano-ID, would generally require recutting other facets to maintain proportionality.\nAnd while the firm trains its customers\u2019 technicians to use its machines and program in the codes themselves, any logos or other IP can only be uploaded by Opsydia itself. \u201CSoftware encryption means we control that,\u201D says Rimmer. \u201CWe\u2019ve set out right from the beginning to have a secure solution.\u201D\nTransparency and traceability have become especially hot topics in the jewelry industry and the wider luxury sector, as demand for goods that are ethically sourced and verifiable has increased sharply. \u201CIssues at the turn of the century such as blood diamonds and conflict gold created awareness that greater transparency was needed in diamond and gem supply chains,\u201D says Laurent Cartier, head of special initiatives at the Swiss Gemmological Institute and a lecturer at the University of Lausanne.\n\u201CToday the main drivers are regulations from governments, the banking sector, and OECD guidelines, and the growing demands of consumers to know more about where and how the gems in their jewelry were sourced.\u201D\nTo that end, technological solutions that can help analyze, verify, and identify diamonds and gemstones are being increasingly explored. Earlier this year, for instance, the Swiss company Spacecode announced a device it says can chemically analyze the makeup of a particular diamond and identify its place of origin, while others are also investigating the notion that each diamond has a unique chemical and morphological \u201Cfingerprint\u201D that can identify it.\nCartier warns against assumptions that technology alone can solve all such issues, \u201Cbut it is a very important part of the traceability puzzle,\u201D he says. Opsydia\u2019s subsurface tech, he says, \u201Cadds an extra layer of security and is a promising approach for high-value diamonds and gemstones.\u201D\nIn particular, Rimmer says Opsydia\u2019s nano-IDs can bring added certainty to the kinds of blockchain platforms that have emerged in recent years to support traceability and authentication in the luxury and jewelry sectors. Examples include the Aura platform developed with Microsoft by LVMH, Cartier, and Prada, and Tracr, launched by the world\u2019s largest diamond producer, De Beers.\nHowever, as Cartier points out, such platforms are only as good as the quality of the data going into them: Knowing the origin of a diamond only tells you so much. \u201CThere may be a paper trail and audits that confirm it comes from a specific mine and a particular set of standards were followed,\u201D he says. \u201CTechnology can be useful in carrying that information all the way through the supply chain in transparent and verifiable ways.\u201D But a paper trail could be assigned to the wrong gem.That, says Rimmer, is where Opsydia comes in. \u201CBlockchain is a way of storing information securely, but you need to make sure it\u2019s linked to the physical stone or piece of jewelry.\u201D So as well as inscribing a serial number that goes into the blockchain, Opsydia\u2019s machines can take a photograph of the inscription that can also be stored in the ledger. As another safeguard, the company has developed a light-box viewing system to demonstrate the inscription in jewelry showrooms.\nRimmer adds that a single Opsydia machine can process around 100,000 stones a year (each one takes around 10 seconds). He\u2019s targeting both profitability for Opsydia, which closed its third funding round last summer, and the processing of 10 million stones annually across the company\u2019s machines, by 2025.\nShaping Space Lasers\nEach Opsydia machine can process around 100,000 stones a year (each one takes around 10 seconds).\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nBut it wasn\u2019t out of a wish to solve diamond traceability that Opsydia\u2019s technology was developed. Rather, it emerged as part of wider research into areas including adaptive optics for space telescopes and the precise shaping of laser beams, conducted at Oxford University\u2019s Department for Engineering Science.\nOpsydia was set up in 2017 through Oxford University Innovation, the company that manages IP licensing and spin-offs from the institution\u2019s research work, to commercialize the research team\u2019s technology. The first laser machines were delivered in 2020, with De Beers\u2019 lab diamond arm, Lightbox Jewelery, among the early takers. As well as diamonds, the laser inscriptions can also be applied to any gemstone.\n\u201CWhen we started, there were a few conversations ongoing around traceability, but now it is the number one conversation in the jewelry industry,\u201D says Rimmer. \u201CSo the real pull is coming from the brands who want to be able to tell this story as part of their promise to consumers, because that\u2019s what they\u2019re asking for.\u201D\nThe war in Ukraine and consequent difficulties in stemming the flow of diamonds from Russia, among the world\u2019s largest producers, into Western markets, have served to highlight the complexity and opaqueness of gemstone supply chains globally, and the need for new ways to tackle this.Opsydia\u2019s technology can only be applied at the stage of a stone being polished and cut, though the company is \u201Clooking at the feasibility of doing something at the \u2018rough\u2019 stage,\u201D says Rimmer, suggesting that raw, uncut diamonds could one day be laser-inscribed at source. That, however, is apparently some way off. \u201CWe\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re investigating,\u201D he says.\nQuantum Leap\nThe laser tech has potential to create atomic-scale defects in the diamond lattice where two carbon atoms are replaced by a nitrogen atom and an empty space. Such chambers have remarkable quantum properties.\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nAway from the glittering world of gemstones, Opsydia\u2019s advances in applying precisely controlled lasers to diamond structures are also presenting opportunities in new industrial fields. \u201CWe\u2019re able to write electrical circuits inside a diamond wafer,\u201D says Rimmer. This brings into play the emerging world of diamond-based electronic devices, with multiple potential applications\u2014including perhaps the greatest prize: quantum computing.\nIn essence, the laser can be tuned to transform localized parts of a diamond's carbon lattice (the arrangement of atoms in a diamond crystal) into graphitic structures that conduct electricity\u2014micro-scale, 3D electronic circuits. Such devices are used in particle accelerators at CERN, for instance, in high-energy particle detection applications where other materials degrade quickly.\nRimmer says there are other potential uses in electrochemistry, instrumentation, and radiation detection. \u201CThe big benefit that diamond has over silicon and other materials is that it\u2019s not damaged by radiation.\u201D\nBut there may be even greater potential in using the laser to create nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in the diamond lattice: invisible, atomic-scale defects where two carbon atoms are replaced by a nitrogen atom and an empty space.\nNV centers have remarkable quantum properties, including ultra-sensitive magnetic field detection and the ability to emit and manipulate light at the single photon level. That makes them effective as controllable and measurable quantum systems.\n\u201CAn NV center can operate as a qubit, which means that diamond is one of the candidate materials for quantum processing,\u201D says Rimmer. While that\u2019s the end goal, nearer-term applications around ultra-fine magnetic sensing and instrumentation\u2014for magnetic ground surveys, for instance, or GPS communication\u2014are also in play.\nAll of that remains at the university research stage for now. Nevertheless, for Opsydia\u2019s investors, diamond traceability may just be the tip of a very sparkly iceberg.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY TIM BARBER","title":"This Laser Can Help Verify the Source of a Diamond","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/opsydia-hide-secret-codes-in-diamonds-space-lasers\/","tags":["","QUANTUM COMPUTING","LUXURY"]},{"date":"09.11.2023","summary":"Research by EY regularly identifies the need for keeping people at the heart of technology-enabled change.","post_content":"HOW CAN BUSINESSES keep their technology from becoming stagnant? That\u2019s the question facing senior leaders across the UK who hope to keep pace with technology innovation and retain their organisations\u2019 competitive advantage.\nIt\u2019s no secret that technology moves quickly, and keeping ahead of the curve can be challenging. But trying to predict the future, and where the world of business is headed can often be futile- however, that doesn\u2019t mean companies don\u2019t try.\nBusinesses will routinely invest huge amounts of time, effort and resource on horizon scanning-often with limited success. Horizon scanning, company monitoring and other tools are all the focus of investment budgets, but can only provide so much information. They\u2019re often lagging indicators, telling businesses what things were like in the recent past. They\u2019re also anonymous, detached data points that don\u2019t always link to the unique pressures individual businesses face or provide actionable insight into how things can be changed.\nWhilst senior leaders can sometimes find reassurance in research investment, more often than not, transformative insights can be found from within the company, and derived from the people who keep it turning- your workforce.\n\u201CIn a race to induct the most cutting-edge technology, some business leaders can fall into the well-trodden trap of prioritising the technology, and then perceived need for it, over their people, and their actual need for it,\u201D Benoit Laclau, consulting managing partner for the UK and Ireland at EY.\n\u201CWe often ask our clients: \u2018Are you reframing the future, or is the future reframing you,\u2019\u201D says Laclau. The question is designed to prompt thinking about hoped for growth aspirations against the backdrop of the changing market- and whether the company is leading the way, or being led by change. Establishing that core principle- of what investment is needed where, at what level, to best benefit the business- is done through collaboration with stakeholders across an organisation, including customers, employees and citizens. By putting stakeholders at the heart of transformation projects, EY teams are better able to establish which investment areas should. be prioritized and for what purpose.\nItalian news organisation Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA) approached EY teams with a complex problem: they needed support to help provide transparency in the origin of the news they were reporting. Staggeringly, falsehoods are 70 percent more likely to be retweeted on social media than the truth, according to research by MIT Media Lab, which can undermine the reputation that news agencies such as ANSA are keen to preserve.\nTo see how ANSA\u2019s news stories spread across the internet, EY teams implemented a blockchain based solution; when an editor publishes a news story it\u2019s fed into the system automatically, with its ID and publication details in a block that is made immutable through notarisation on the blockchain. When these stories are published online, they are given an \u201CANSACheck\u201D sticker that readers can click on to see who has written and potentially republished them. ANSACheck enables readers to confirm that news origins are true and trusted, and drives a deeper understanding of the news process \u2013 which is particularly relevant if a story is controversial.ANSACheck came into its own during the Covid-19 pandemic, when disinformation thrived and many readers asked about the origin of some stories that mentioned ANSA as a source. ANSA was able, through ANSACheck, to confirm that the source of the stories was not authentic. It combined the best of both worlds: a data-driven, human-centric approach can help affect meaningful change.\n\u201CInvestment for investment\u2019s sake isn\u2019t worth it,\u201D says Laclau. \u201CIt needs to have a purpose for leaders to see a return on their investment. In the Tech Horizons survey conducted by EY teams, 71 per cent of respondents ranked talent and culture in the top three success factors for transformation. Businesses that exceed expectations combine people and technology to grow their business faster. It is rarely the case that technology alone helps businesses to innovate- successful transformation relies on designing technology around user needs and putting people at the heart of change, as ANSA did.\u201D\nBut delivering on the promise of human-centric transformation is often easier said than done. EY teams are brought in to help initiate and deliver change within businesses with whom they work to avoid falling into the trap of rolling out a technology that doesn't meet needs of the business or its stakeholders.\nTo discover how ANSA used blockchain technologies to restore trust in news and deliver a people-centric transformation, read the full case study, then see how EY teams can help you.\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","post_cover":null,"author":null,"title":"Unlock greater value from your transformation investment","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/four-key-investment-areas-for-business-leaders\/","tags":[""]},{"date":"10.19.2023","summary":"With a new emphasis on the Hamas attacks on Israel, the US Treasury has proposed designating foreign cryptocurrency \u201Cmixer\u201D services as money launderers and national security threats.","post_content":"HAMAS\u2019 ATTACKS AGAINST Israel on October 7 have shifted the geopolitical landscape and triggered a looming Israeli ground assault in the Gaza Strip. Now the ripple effects are reaching the cryptocurrency industry, where they\u2019ve become the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s rallying cry for a crackdown on cryptocurrency anonymity services.\nThe US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today released a set of proposed rules that would designate foreign cryptocurrency \u201Cmixers\u201D\u2014services that blend users\u2019 digital funds to offer more anonymity and make them harder to trace\u2014as money laundering tools that pose a threat to national security and would thus face new sanctions and regulations. The new rules, if adopted following a 90-day period of public comment and debate, would potentially represent the broadest restrictions imposed yet on the mixing services and could make it far harder for cryptocurrency holders to put their money through the services before cashing it out at a US cryptocurrency exchange, or even at a foreign exchange that accepts US customers.\nWhile the proposed rules were almost certainly in the works long before October 7, the Treasury\u2019s announcement tied the push for a change in policy directly to the use of cryptocurrency by Hamas and militant groups in Gaza. \u201CThe Treasury Department is aggressively combatting illicit use of all aspects of the CVC ecosystem by terrorist groups,\u201D Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury, wrote in a statement, using the term \u201CCVC\u201D to mean convertible virtual currency. Adeyemo says that this includes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group that often aligns with Hamas, which Israel blamed for an explosion at a hospital in Gaza earlier this week.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nCryptocurrency mixers have existed almost as long as Bitcoin itself. They offer to take in a user\u2019s cryptocurrency, blend it with that of other users, and return the funds so that they are harder to follow from their origin to destination on blockchains, which generally record every transaction in full public view. The Treasury\u2019s rule change would designate those cryptocurrency-mixing services\u2014or at least the majority of them that are based outside the US\u2014as a \u201Cprimary money laundering concern.\u201D They would thus be considered a threat to US national security as defined by section 311 of the Patriot Act, a section of the law designed to restrict how domestic financial institutions interact with potential sources of terrorist financing.\nThe rule change would mean that US financial services, as well foreign ones with US customers\u2014including cryptocurrency exchanges\u2014would have to go through extra record-keeping and reporting requirements for funds that have touched a foreign cryptocurrency mixer, and it might even allow the Treasury to block US exchanges from handling those funds. \u201CWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201D says Ari Redbord, the head of global policy for TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm. Redbord notes that the rule change isn\u2019t proposing a blanket ban on foreign mixing services, only new rules for interacting with them. \u201CThe reality, however, is that 311 actions oftentimes have a sort of name-and-shame effect, where people are just not wanting to engage with these platforms out of fear of being caught up in money laundering or other type of illicit activity.\u201D\nRedbord, who previously served as an advisor to the Treasury\u2019s undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, also notes that the proposal was no doubt being considered prior to the latest Hamas attacks and that the Treasury must have changed the proposal\u2019s focus from the use of cryptocurrency by other national security threats, like North Korea and Russia, to Hamas and militant groups in recent days. \u201CHaving been at Treasury for a number of years, you don\u2019t just roll out an action like this over the course of 10 days,\u201D says Redbord. \u201CThey\u2019ve kind of shifted the narrative toward Hamas because that\u2019s the news.\u201DHamas and militant groups\u2019 use of cryptocurrency, while significant, pales in comparison to the amount of cryptocurrency used by other illicit actors. Hamas, for instance, raised $41 million in cryptocurrency over the past two years, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad raised $91 million, according to a report last week in the Wall Street Journal that cited analyses by cryptocurrency tracing firms and seizures by the Israeli government.\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, how much of those funds actually made it to these groups before being seized. In fact, Hamas asked its donors to stop using cryptocurrency in April of 2023, due to the public nature of the transactions on blockchains and the risk of prosecution. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis, which frequently works with government and law enforcement customers, went so far as to publish a blog post yesterday cautioning against mistaken analyses that overestimate the role of cryptocurrency in financing entities like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nNorth Korean state-sponsored cybercriminals, Russian ransomware gangs, and other criminal groups, by contrast, have pocketed billions of dollars through their theft of cryptocurrency or use of the technology as a means of demanding extortion payments from victims. Thieves stole $3.8 billion in crypto last year\u2014much of which went to the North Korean regime\u2014and ransomware hackers extorted close to $450 million in just the first half of 2023, according to Chainalysis.\nThose criminals often use cryptocurrency mixing services, funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into services like ChipMixer and Sinbad.io. In fact, US law enforcement and the Treasury Department have aggressively sanctioned or shut down one mixer service after another in recent years, including Blender, TornadoCash, and Bitzlato, often citing their use in laundering the profits of those North Korean and Russian hackers.\nThe new FinCEN rules would be less severe than those sanctions, indictments, and busts\u2014a new regulatory process rather than a ban\u2014but also far wider in scope, says Jason Somensatto, Chainalysis\u2019 head of North America public policy. \u201CThe impact can be much broader,\u201D says Somensatto. \u201CThey can say that this applies to all mixing services that people are interacting with.\u201D\nAs the Treasury doubles down on its push to cut off crypto-based money laundering\u2014and now points to Hamas as a new impetus for that crackdown\u2014TRM Labs\u2019 Redbord cautions that US regulators shouldn\u2019t go too far in censuring services that do, in some cases, offer financial privacy to legitimate users. After all, without mixers, most cryptocurrency transactions are fully public in nature. \u201CI think the challenge for regulators is, how do we thread the needle between stopping illicit actors from using these platforms but at the same time allow regular users to enable some degree of privacy?\u201D Redbord says. \u201CI think the concern is that this could very much be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Citing Hamas, the US Wants to Treat Crypto Anonymity Services as Suspected Money Launderers","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/us-treasury-crypto-mixer-hamas\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","ISRAEL","ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR"]},{"date":"07.02.2023","summary":"An ultra-libertarian Balkan \u201Ccountry\u201D called Liberland celebrated its eighth anniversary with a boat party and a barbecue, but no one lives there.","post_content":"LATE ONE MORNING in April, a boat called Liberty sailed down the Danube on a reconnaissance mission, toward a destination found on no map or atlas.

That's a Morin. Three, two, one. Hi, I'm Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And I'm Gideon Lichfield. And this is Have a Nice Future, a podcast about how terrifyingly fast everything is changing.\nLauren Goode: Each week, we talk to someone with big, audacious, and sometimes unnerving ideas about the future, and we ask them how we can all prepare to live in it.\nGideon Lichfield: Our guest this week is Michael Casey, the chief content officer of CoinDesk, the cryptocurrency news site that almost exactly one year ago brought down Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s multibillion-dollar crypto empire.Michael Casey (audio clip): What I find extremely frustrating is that the debate is about \u2018look how many bad people there are over here; we need to just shut this industry down\u2019 as opposed to thinking hard and intelligently about the technology itself and how we might actually create a safer system so that those bad people don't take charge of it.\nLauren Goode: Alright Gideon, I'm going to ask the question that's on a lot of people's minds: Is crypto dead?\nGideon Lichfield: Dead as in like nobody using it anymore?\nLauren Goode: Well, I mean, obviously people are still using it, but as you mentioned, I think the meltdown of FTX was a real wake-up call for crypto believers. It was so hyped up, and it ended up losing customers and billions of dollars. SBF was the poster boy of crypto, and now he's on trial for fraud, which we are covering at WIRED. And I feel like pretty much every crypto story I've read since then has been about other crypto companies or exchanges struggling because of the ripple effects of that collapse.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. And everyone's talking about crypto winter for\u2014I dunno, like the fourth or fifth time, and yet as SBF's trial was starting, the price of bitcoin was up something like 30 percent on what it was right before FTX collapsed, so a lot of people still believe in crypto.\nLauren Goode: Which still doesn't make sense to me at all.\nGideon Lichfield: And it didn't to me either, so that's one of the reasons I wanted to talk to Michael Casey.\nLauren Goode: Did you know that I used to work with Michael Casey at Dow Jones?\nGideon Lichfield: I did not.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I used to. I used to bug him to join me on a livestreaming video show that I was doing at The Wall Street Journal. I had no idea he was a crypto guy or became one.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes, he absolutely still thinks crypto is the future of financial systems, and he's in this interesting, unique position because CoinDesk is a media company whose very purpose hinges on the existence of crypto and indeed the success of crypto as a technology. But it also did the reporting that took down SBF and caused all this turmoil that we've seen in the industry.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, they actually won a big award for that recently. Did you happen to see that?\nGideon Lichfield: Oh, actually I didn't.\nLauren Goode: They won a Loeb, which is one of the most prestigious awards in business journalism, so kudos to them. But I also saw that CoinDesk was put up for sale.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Was that in any way related to the FTX collapse?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, indeed it was and that's another part of what makes their situation so interesting. So CoinDesk's parent company, DCG, owns a bunch of crypto companies and assets, and the fallout of FTX forced it to put a lot of those assets up for sale, including CoinDesk itself. So Michael's challenge now is how to make CoinDesk a thriving business during this latest crypto winter.Lauren Goode: Ah, so you're saying the future of journalism is not to put all of your assets in crypto?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, maybe the future of crypto journalism is not to put all your assets in crypto, that's for sure.\nLauren Goode: OK, fair enough.\nGideon Lichfield: Anyway, I wanted to talk to Michael both to have him explain how he still believes in crypto after everything that's happened, but also to understand how a news organization that's covering this industry walks the line between being an advocate for it and also a critic of it.\nLauren Goode: Well, I'm so curious to hear what he has to say.\nGideon Lichfield: And that conversation is coming up right after the break.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Michael Casey, welcome to Have a Nice Future.\nMichael Casey: Thank you for having me, Gideon.\nGideon Lichfield: Are you having a nice future?\nMichael Casey: Ask me tomorrow. I don't know.\nGideon Lichfield: Ask you in the future?\nMichael Casey In the future.\nGideon Lichfield: OK. Well, we're speaking because it's coming up to a year after one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, went bankrupt and billions of dollars worth of its customers\u2019 money went missing, and we're here basically to talk about how the crypto world looks a year after that and how it will look in the future. But I wanna start with you. How did you start covering crypto? What made you interested in it, and what made you believe in it?\nMichael Casey: Yeah, so I was at The Wall Street Journal at the time, and I had covered currencies. I saw this strange thing called bitcoin everyone was talking about. This is in 2013. I was writing a column at the time called \u201CHorizons\u201D for The Wall Street Journal. And I don't know. I wrote some pretty basic, \"Hey, don't touch this thing. It's probably a tulip bubble\" kind of story. And then I got called in by a few people who\u2014some of whom are still in the industry, some who aren't, some prominent names, some of them big venture capitalists and others, taken out for dinner\u2014explained what it was all about. And I think because of the fact that I'd spent six years of my life in Argentina, a country that just has perpetual crises\u2014it's just never resolved it's monetary problems throughout a very long 100-year history of ups and downs\u2014and suddenly this alternative to how a monetary system could run was presented in front of me, something that didn't need a government, and it just dawned on me as just a phenomenal idea.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, so you saw crypto as a kind of an answer to the brokenness of existing financial systems.\nMichael Casey: And also just a different\u2014just fascinating that you didn't\u2014you could construct it without an institution in the middle of it. This idea that money didn't have to be issued by a government, that was just a revelation that just became a never-ending quest to explore.Gideon Lichfield: So you wound up as chief content officer at CoinDesk, which famously published the story last November that brought down FTX, and we'll talk more about that in a second. But maybe just for our listeners who don't know, describe really briefly what CoinDesk is.\nMichael Casey: We describe ourselves as the leading media events and indices company in the crypto and digital asset space.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, and so a lot of media companies that cover a particular industry, you have this sort of joint role of being a watchdog for it and also, to an extent, a cheerleader. You are interested in growing and promoting the existence of the industry itself and making it better. Does that seem fair? And I think\u2014\nMichael Casey: I think so. I always flinch a little bit, and I think you as a journalist would do as you hear the word cheerleader. Like, it's just not something we ever wanna describe ourselves as. I think that it's pretty hard to be in crypto journalism if you don't have some belief in the power of the technology. That's obviously quite different from cheerleading any particular company or even cheerleading the industry as it currently is, right? Like the two things are different.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. The thing that I think is interesting is, any industry media publication has to strike this balance, but it's an especially delicate balance in an industry like crypto where there are so many scams and grifts. So what are your guiding principles for being honest about what is going on in the industry whilst also fundamentally believing that it's a worthwhile industry?\nMichael Casey: So many scams. There are a lot, without a doubt. Like I think it would be naive to say that there are not a lot of scams. It is obviously something that we are constantly reporting on. You just have to look at CoinDesk coverage. If you truly believe, as I do, for example, that we have an a fundamentally broken internet with Google, Facebook, and these massive platforms controlling our data and manipulating us via that, and you'd love to see a system that no longer had that dependency, and people had control of their data, then you're gonna cover this industry for the sake of holding it to account so that it does improve.\nGideon Lichfield: So speaking of that\u2014speaking of holding an industry to account\u2014let's go back to the day November 2 when CoinDesk published this report on problems at FTX. Maybe just begin by very briefly describing what those problems were for anyone who doesn't remember.\nMichael Casey: OK. So the first company that now I named\u2014that everybody would be familiar with\u2014Sam Bankman-Fried had created before he created the exchange FTX, was called Alameda Research. Alameda was a trading firm, and there was always known that there was a relationship between the two companies, but we didn't really have any idea about how deeply intertwined they were until our reporter Ian Allison got ahold of a balance sheet. This is a private company that the balance sheet was not formally released, and this was Alameda's balance sheet. And it showed that a lot of the assets that it recognized on its books were actually FTT, a token that was issued by FTX. What that showed was this very circular relationship that the assets that this company held were actually completely defined by the institution of which it depended for a lot of business, and essentially it exposed a house of cards and front-running, misuse of customer funds, and an absolutely enormous number of breaches of the fiduciary duty that any exchange has to its users.Gideon Lichfield: Do you think that you could have predicted when FTX first collapsed that it would have so many ripple effects in this way, such a domino effect?\nMichael Casey: We could have. I don't think we did. I'm not sure many people did. There were certainly people that were looking at the prevalence, and let's remember that these problems existed in traditional finance as well, right? The intertwined structure of Wall Street was a defining feature of the financial crisis of 2008, but I don't think anyone really was out there just predicting how dramatically affected everybody would be.\nGideon Lichfield: So overall, how would you say the crypto world looks today in the wake of all of that?\nMichael Casey: So there's been two phases of what people in this industry describe as the crypto winter. The first is this massive unwind\u2014a load of bankruptcies\u2014then what we've seen in each of these winters, a departure of interest in the sector from the kind of retail enthusiasts who were the fly-by-night folks who would come in and out, not sort of long-term investors, but just had gotten excited at the top of the market. And as always, when these things happens, they're the ones who lose their shirts. When it comes down, those people had disappeared. There was no more\u2014the search queries on Google for \u201Ccrypto,\u201D for example, have just plummeted. What's different about this time is it has also come with a very aggressive set of enforcement actions by the US regulatory apparatus, most notably by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC. It's my belief, others might say otherwise, that the extraordinarily large extent to which my former colleague at MIT, Gary Gensler, has gone to to really attack a lot of firms here\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: This is Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman.\nMichael Casey: That's right, the chairman of the SEC. It feels very motivated by payback, right, a very large number of lawmakers who had received donations from Sam Bankman-Fried and from FTX. He'd spread his largesse across both sides of the house, and then it turned out that he was just a crook, a\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: Just as bad as the rest, yeah.\nMichael Casey: I would say he was far worse, actually.\nGideon Lichfield: Well, worse than worst of them even.\nMichael Casey: Far, far worse, because it is this idea that you have breached everybody's trust. You don't go into Washington and make this sort of a mess without expecting some payback, and it is conceived as a payback against all of crypto, which is pretty unfair, I would say.\nGideon Lichfield: I'm gonna challenge you on that in a bit, because I wanna talk about what the SEC is actually doing. So in June, it sued Binance and Coinbase, which are two of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges. A large part of its lawsuit against both exchanges is that it thinks most crypto assets should be regulated like securities, like stocks and bonds, for example. But then there's a second issue, and that's where it's really suing\u2014where the SEC is suing Binance, which is a bunch of violations for mismanaging its customers funds, which are not unsimilar to some of the charges that were leveled against FTX. So let's take these two things in.Michael Casey: Or MS Global or HSBC or Standard Chartered or any single bank that has been in this. I'm not trying to shun or forgive them, but those things happen throughout finance, because finance is full of crooks. It always has, always has been. I've been covering it for 20 years, and trust me, there are a lot. You could look through a Wikipedia page on something like this, but anyway, carry on.\nGideon Lichfield: Alright. Well, let's go back to these two separate issues as they relate to crypto. So let's start with the regulatory question, should most crypto assets be regulated like securities as the SEC is claiming? What's your position on that?\nMichael Casey: If you just treat every token as a security, it ceases to be able to function for what it does. And so if you created a system that was purely securities, then anybody owning one, anybody who wants to participate\u2014this is supposed to be an open system, it's supposed to solve things like financial inclusion so that people in the developing world can gain access to payment systems and so forth\u2014every one of those people would have to be an accredited investor. That doesn't make any sense. You can't run a decentralized system with that level of bureaucracy in the middle of it.\nGideon Lichfield: OK, so it sounds like you're basically saying that regulating crypto assets as securities would limit far too much the ability of people to participate in this system and to use it to solve the kinds of financial problems that you think crypto currencies can solve.\nMichael Casey: I'm not at all saying that this shouldn't be regulated. I'm saying that we need a smart way of trying to deal with this.\nGideon Lichfield: So I think part of the reason that the SEC is trying to enforce these assets or securities is that regardless of what you say should ideally be happening, people aren't treating them as speculative investments. Like Ethereum I think is up 20 percent for the year. Is there a way to square the circle? Is there a way to have it not become just a speculative asset than\u2014\nMichael Casey: Sure, it's called consumer finance, it's called\u2014there's a whole lot of laws for \u2014what Sam Bankman-Fried did was allegedly illegal. Let's see how the case that started now plays out. I think many people are pretty convinced that it was. And there's laws that don't require necessarily securities laws to do so. Like there's a breach of a whole host of consumer finance and fiduciary duties. There is all sorts of ways to stop people from doing bad things. Like the risk that an investor faces, which is what you are trying to protect against, comes down to who controls it? Is there a system in which some company, some entity, some person controls your assets? And under a pure decentralized crypto system, you control the assets, not Sam Bankman-Fried. And so there's a lot out there that would make this a safer system, but it's really not being contemplated by the current administration.Gideon Lichfield: You said just now that what Sam Bankman-Fried did was allegedly illegal. Is there a world in which it wasn't illegal?\nMichael Casey: I think we all\u2014I know. I'm trying to be a good journalist here, Gideon. I'm just trying to like\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: Just because he hasn't been found guilty yet.\nMichael Casey: Innocent before proven guilty, yes, but I think he did.\nGideon Lichfield: Fair enough.\nMichael Casey: That's it.\nGideon Lichfield: Alright. So, let's go back to something else that you said, 'cause I started talking about how the SEC is also suing Binance over allegedly misusing its customer's funds, or mismanaging them, and how that was similar to what FTX did, and you jumped in and said, well, also a whole bunch of banks, also large parts of the truth about the financial system.\nMichael Casey: Which sounds like whataboutism maybe, yeah? But\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: It sounds a little bit like whataboutism, but I think more interestingly than that, my question is this, some of the promise\u2014I think, well, the promise of crypto was that it was gonna be decentralized, was that it wasn't gonna be captured by institutions or by individuals, and yet that is the fact of what has happened, because it turns out that even when you run a decentralized system, you need some things like exchanges or you need trading spaces for NFTs, for example, and those end up being dominated by, on the whole, a handful of parties. So I feel like the problem of corruption or mismanagement that we've seen in the crypto industry is to a large extent for that reason. In other words, it doesn't seem like it is actually immune from the same kind of challenges that face the financial system. So how would you get past that?\nMichael Casey: Well, I think that's a fair criticism, and I think that that's on crypto, that's on this industry for defaulting to the simple solutions.\nGideon Lichfield: Is it on crypto, or is it just on human beings?\nMichael Casey: I think it's on human beings as well. I think actually it's very difficult to build the decentralized system. They are inherently complicated, and it's very, very difficult to do it by snapping your fingers, but bitcoin achieved it. There is nobody in charge of bitcoin and it runs this way day in, day out.\nGideon Lichfield: But there are people in charge of the exchanges when bitcoin is traded.\nMichael Casey: Sure, sure.\nGideon Lichfield: I think that's my point, is that\u2014\nMichael Casey: No, it is and we can\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: It ends up centralizing somewhere.\nMichael Casey: But there are decentralized exchanges, Gideon. There are, and they function. Some of them, Uniswap for example, has really never had any problems. It works. It's very complicated for the average person to use. So it's still on crypto. Crypto needs to develop better UX, be easier systems, et cetera, et cetera. The point I'm just simply making is that it's possible to build these things, and if there were the right framework within which to do so, I think innovation would go in that direction.Gideon Lichfield: Can you give maybe just one example of a piece of regulation that you think would help make crypto safer?\nMichael Casey: There are laws around the separation of trading operations and investment. A variety of things that are just the norm for now for exchanges in the TradFi world should be applied in crypto, and that would just be one very effective way to, I think, protect investors and consumers from malfeasance.\nGideon Lichfield: Has the past yet changed your own thinking about the future of the crypto industry in any way?\nMichael Casey: It's made it apparent that we have to figure this out as a political process. There has to be public debate about, there has to be engagement with politicians. We've got to figure out a regulatory transition somewhere that enables this in the right way. So I think there's a\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: What do you think makes that difficult?\nMichael Casey: Oh, it's lack of education. I think it is characters like Sam Bankman-Fried, who have just shed such a negative light on this industry. So what I find extremely frustrating is that the debate is about, \u201Clook how many bad people there are over here; we need to just shut this industry down\u201D as opposed to thinking hard and intelligently about the technology itself and how we might actually create a safer system so that those bad people don't take charge of it. I don't know. It's frustrating.\nGideon Lichfield: To me who's always been something of a crypto skeptic, I think the past year has just reinforced my sense that\u2014\nMichael Casey: I'm sure it has.\nGideon Lichfield: It's going to be\u2014it's gonna be confined to a fairly niche group of users, because as you say, there are problems with making it usable and accessible and then difficulties in explaining to people how to regulate it or how to have a sensible conversation about regulation. And it still seems to be beset by volatility and by risk, and by risk of insight and seeding and all of these things.\nMichael Casey: Bitcoin's been a stable asset around for the last month by the way, but you're right. In general, you're right. Yes.\nGideon Lichfield: You're obviously a still big believer\u2014still a big believer. So what is it that can convince me that I should think differently?\nMichael Casey: I'm a believer in the underlying technology. I'm a believer in the underlying technology. I believe that we\u2014I literally believe we have no choice but to create some sort of decentralized system.\nGideon Lichfield: Why?\nMichael Casey: Well, because, Google. The monopolization of our lives. It's the idea that our data is controlled by these algorithms, and we're moving into an AI world in which those centralized entities, profit-motively driven to literally manipulate us with that data, are now going to get even more powerful. So that is what's at stake here. We can just talk about Sam Bankman-Fried and like whether or not we need a fancy way to play some sort of insurance scam. It's really about how is the digital economy going to function going forward. We need this thing to be fixed, I'm telling you.Gideon Lichfield: Alright, let's talk about the future since this is called Have a Nice Future. What do you think crypto looks like in\u2014I don't know, 10 to 15 years from now?\nMichael Casey: I think it's going to be normalized through the financial system. I'm not sure that that's great, by the way. I think you're going to have a lot of traditional finance actors. If you know, we now\u2014we have BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, all these sort of big institutions, very, very far down the path of developing their own digital asset strategies. They are looking to have ETFs and the like regulated, and I think they're going to be the big players in this space.\nGideon Lichfield: And that's bad why?\nMichael Casey: It's bad if it normalizes the idea that the only way to actually participate in this is through a old 1933 Securities Act, which means that if you are wanting to own or trade bitcoin and you are not an accredited investor or you're not a big institution, then the only way to own it is through some ETF that is controlled by so and so. You can't\u2014that idea of monetary freedom that it represents is not possible if this has to be heavily, heavily regulated. I\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: But you're not against regulation. It sounds like you're against\u2014\nMichael Casey: No, no, but I'm\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: The old institutions\u2014\nMichael Casey: I have a problem with\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: Getting their fingers in it.\nMichael Casey: Yes. And what I'm trying to say is like by the institutions coming along and validating it, they're all regulated, right? They're essentially endorsing the system. The general public is just not going to think about they're all gonna buy their ETFs and so forth. It's not going to be the same sort of decentralized system. But look, I don't think that's the end of the world because I've never been a believer that the most valuable thing was everybody owning bitcoin. That's going to sound like heresy to a lot of Bitcoin Maxis but I don't think that's it, right? I actually do think that creating decentralized mechanisms for things like data for\u2014again, I go back to the internet. I think those are the most important things. And so what I'm actually most encouraged by, what I would like to think is going to be the most interesting thing happening in the next 10 years, is that self-sovereign identity solutions are going to become the norm.\nGideon Lichfield: So CoinDesk parent company DCG also obviously suffered some fallout from the FTX collapse, and in July, it was announced that CoinDesk is being sold to outside investors. Does that change anything for CoinDesk?\nMichael Casey: Oh, inevitably. A change of ownership does, the new phase. I think DCG has had a very, very tough last year and a half, and it's difficult when your parent company is going through that. We have a whole host of things that we want to do. We still believe there's huge growth opportunities. The deal as it's structured would have a wider variety of investors as part of a consortium and that's I think a constructive structure for a news organization that is striving to be independent.Gideon Lichfield: Other than the future of CoinDesk, what keeps you up at night?\nMichael Casey: I think we could very well go rapidly into a dystopian world in which humanity is reduced to a bit player in a system run by machines and that the worst of human instincts will now be adopted by machines, which will basically carry out the work. That's the dystopian path, right? If we get it right and really focus on taking power away from the centralized entities that control these massive data-driven models, and figure out how there's a collective ownership in that, then of course AI could just be a wonderful driver of a bright future, a better future, that your podcast is looking for everyone to have.\nGideon Lichfield: And so the flip side of that is what keeps you optimistic?\nMichael Casey: I'm going to sound a little hokey, but I actually think that at their core, human beings want to do well by each other. And we need systems that enhance that, that encourage that, that actually are built to protect against the worst instincts that we have and encourage the best ones.\nGideon Lichfield: And it sounds like you think that crypto could be one of those systems even though it hasn't been\u2014\nMichael Casey: Crypto could be part of it. Again, I'm not going to be this\u2014I'm not the naive \u201Cit fixes everything.\u201D This is not a \u201Cthere's a blockchain for that solution\u201D kind of guy. I believe in government and regulation and all those things but I think that we need to think hard about where there's a good intersection between existing systems and certain centralized solutions, government and these decentralized alternatives that brings us to that happier place.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Well, Michael, thank you very much for making the case for believing in crypto in these systems despite all of the events of the last year and few years. So thank you for joining us on Have a Nice Future.\nMichael Casey: Thank you for having me, Gideon.\nLauren Goode: So do you own any crypto?\nGideon Lichfield: I still own no crypto. I do own an NFT of some piece of art that I was given, but no, I've never bought or sold a piece of cryptocurrency. What about you?\nLauren Goode: Wait, hold on. You own a piece of an NFT or a piece of art that's an NFT?\nGideon Lichfield: A piece of art that's an NFT or rather an NFT\u2014\nLauren Goode: What is that?\nGideon Lichfield: Of a piece of art? You know what, I haven't even looked at it in a while. I don't remember. It was a freebie. It was a freebie at some event about NFTs. You know how these things go.\nLauren Goode: Wow. Have you checked the value of it lately?\nGideon Lichfield: I'm not even sure it has value.Lauren Goode: OK. I wrote a story last year for WIRED about a Steph Curry NFT that I had been, I guess, gifted. It was on loan to me, and I think at the time that I acquired it, which is February of 2022, and by the time I wrote about it, which was the spring or maybe summer of 2022, [laughter] it had declined in value from like $1,000 to $6.\nGideon Lichfield: Wow. OK. I mean, I feel like we're just exposing our Luddite tendencies here by talking about how we don't own any crypto. And it used to be this thing that journalists shouldn't own cryptocurrency because it was like having a conflict of interest. I think definitely we should be past that by now. Certainly if you're going to write about cryptocurrency, I think it makes sense to at least own a token amount of it so you understand how it works.\nLauren Goode: Well, that's good that I own some then.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes, indeed. It is. You have more authority than I do.\nLauren Goode: I'm looking at my Robinhood app right now, and according to this, on the day of taping, I am $15.27 in a hole on my sliver of a bitcoin. So I'm doing really well here. I mean, I bought\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: When did you buy the sliver of a bitcoin?\nLauren Goode: Let's see if I can tap on it and see my history. Well, I'm checking my positions right now. It's actually up 43 percent over the past year according to this. Why am I down? I don't know. I don't understand it. I quite really don't understand it.\nGideon Lichfield: Just wait long enough and you'll be up again. That is the nature of these things.\nLauren Goode: I can tell you that even if we emerge from this trough, this crypto winter and this surges, I'm still not going to be able to retire.\nGideon Lichfield: So you're saying you're not giving up the day job?\nLauren Goode: No, not giving up the day job. And I would say that I'm still a crypto skeptic like you, and I'm wondering, did your conversation with Michael Casey make you any less skeptical?\nGideon Lichfield: I don't think it did. I mean, I think the argument that I was having back and forth with Michael at some level was about whether the potential for cryptocurrency to be a well-regulated, well-run, largely fraud-free industry depended on the technology itself, on the ability of the technology to provide decentralized systems, or whether it is really entirely dependent on the human beings and human beings tendency to find graft opportunities wherever they can. And so Michael was saying to me, look, the traditional financial industry is full of fraud as well and the crypto industry has a chance to be better because it has this decentralized technology.\nLauren Goode: I guess I'm still wondering whether or not you're convinced.Gideon Lichfield: I want to not be quite as skeptical as I am, and maybe I should just buy some crypto and get into it so that I can ease my skepticism that way. But for me, the thing that is fundamental here is when you look at the crypto industry, the promise of crypto was supposed to be the decentralization that no one person or entity was going to have power over these systems. And as I was saying to Michael, what you've seen emerge again and again is that even when you have decentralized currencies on a blockchain, you still need some centralized entity somewhere along the line for it to work. You need an exchange where cryptocurrency is turned into conventional currency, you need a marketplace where NFTs are bought and sold, you need some system for, let's say, blockchains have been used for land registries, for example, but somebody needs to authenticate that you actually own that land before you can put it on a blockchain. So no matter where you are in the system, there is an opportunity for humans to insert themselves, for power to be centralized and for fraud to happen, and I'm just not convinced that that can ever be overcome. But Michael was arguing if we only regulate things well enough, and if the crypto industry itself somehow gets its act together, despite having been so fraud-ridden up to now, then maybe things can get better.\nLauren Goode: He seemed to be implying that the SEC's efforts to regulate crypto are inspired by vengeance rather than motivated by a real desire to protect investors. Do you agree with that?\nGideon Lichfield: Not really. I mean, he was saying that lots and lots of lawmakers took money from Sam Bankman-Fried, which is true. He was spreading his largesse left and right and that therefore the SEC's enforcement against the industry was kind of payback for that, but I don't think that's true at all. I think the effort to regulate cryptocurrencies as securities dates back long before most people had heard of Sam Bankman-Fried, and it is this debate that's been running for a while about whether these assets that can be much more than just a currency, like in the case of Ethereum, it's essentially the basis for an entire programming language, whether those should be regulated like securities that people trade in other ways or whether they should be dealt with as some kind of a new thing. And I agree, I suppose, with Michael that we need to not try to apply 100-year-old securities laws to these entirely new instruments. We ought to come up with something better. But on the other hand, I think that trying to protect investors from these very, very volatile markets is a sensible instinct. And much as people like Michael Casey would like cryptocurrencies to be treated as more than just a speculative investment, the fact is that they are being treated as a speculative investment and that is what the SEC is trying to protect people from.Lauren Goode: So Michael also talked about the \"monopolization of our lives.\" He said we're moving into an AI world in which decentralized entities, and he was talking about companies like Google and Meta are driven to manipulate us with that data, our data, and are going to get even more powerful. That really resonated with me. But how do you think he meant crypto is supposed to solve that?\nGideon Lichfield: I can't say that I understand this argument very well, but it's one I've encountered in the past, which is if we own our data, if we have access to or control data about us, or data about our customers, for example, or our followers on social media, if we have that data and we control it and it's on a blockchain rather than being held by a centralized company like Google or Facebook, if we have that control, then we have power over that data, then we can decide what happens to it, we can find ways to make money off of it, we can decide who to transfer it to, but it's never going to be in the hands of a company that can take it away from us. How exactly that's supposed to work is the stuff that I don't understand very well, but that's the kind of the principle that a lot of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts talk about.\nLauren Goode: So what's actually a better solution here? Introducing a decentralized but potentially befuddling new form of internet or regulating the monopolies as they currently exist?\nGideon Lichfield: So I think that is the key question. Michael and I actually got into a discussion on this that was too long to include in the podcast. But a few weeks ago, you interviewed Cory Doctorow here on the show and Cory's belief, like Michael's, is that we need to strip away the power of these gigantic tech companies that control all our data. But they come at it from very, very different ways of how to do it. And so Michael is saying if we use blockchains and cryptocurrency, we can give people ownership of their data in such a way that it is decentralized, no single entity controls it, and then that gives people the power. Cory takes a rather different view and he says what we need is interoperability. We need to force the big tech companies to let us move our data back and forth between them to if we decide we want to take our contact or our social media graph or all our photos and videos and whatever off of Meta and put them onto some other company's platform, we should be able to do that. And if regulation forces the tech companies to let us do that, that will put power back in the hands of the people.\nLauren Goode: How to build a better internet\u2014that's what it is, that's sort of what we're getting at. In fact, we should probably just rebrand the show that.Gideon Lichfield: Yeah, how to build a better internet. But if you're asking me which of those approaches I believe in more, I suppose I probably lean more towards interoperability. I feel like it's going to be easier to introduce regulation that forces companies to let their users move their data around than it is to build an entire new system for data management and ownership based on blockchains and make that system easy to use and understandable to everybody 'cause right now it's really confusing, but of course Michael would disagree with me on that.\nLauren Goode: So what do you think that means for the future of the blockchain then? I mean, does it mean that 10 years from now we're still talking about it as something that like the folks over at Andreessen Horowitz are using and [laughter] maybe a few outliers around the world and we're still just battling for a better internet based on the infrastructure we currently have?\nGideon Lichfield: I actually think that despite my skepticism, I'm relatively bullish for the future of the blockchain and crypto 'cause I think so many people are invested in it at this point. So many people are working on different variations of this technology. That there is still going to be an industry in five or 10 years time. I've no idea what it's going to be doing. Perhaps I will be proved wrong on a lot of the things I've said about how susceptible it is to fraud and corruption or how difficult it is to use. Maybe those problems will be solved and Michael is right. Most revealing and possibly most realistic is that crypto does have a future, but it's one in which it's basically been co-opted by the existing big tech platforms and by the existing big banks and they all issue their own ETFs for crypto, and we end up in a similar\u2014\nLauren Goode: The Vanguards of the world and Fidelity's of the world. It's not very sexy.\nGideon Lichfield: It's not very sexy, but it's like the Occam's razor prediction that things will change less than you expect. And so we will end up with crypto, but it will still be run by big banks.\nLauren Goode: And at that point, I will be retired on my crypto earnings.\nGideon Lichfield: I very much hope so for your sake.\nLauren Goode: My sliver of bitcoin. That's a very optimistic view of the future.\nGideon Lichfield: In that case, let's end on that note.\nLauren Goode: Alright, that's our show for today.

This knowledge is all thanks to the QR code on the shirt\u2019s label and hangtag.\nScanning the QR code takes them to the shirt\u2019s entry on the Aura Blockchain Consortium\u2014a blockchain that is equally owned by a who\u2019s who of luxury companies: LVMH, OTB Group, Prada, Richemont, and Mercedes-Benz. \nA Loro Piana analyst assessing the quality of some fibers.\nYou\u2019ve likely heard of the blockchain, but if you\u2019re still in the dark about what it is, a blockchain network is essentially a shared, digital ledger of transactions which, once recorded, can\u2019t be changed or tampered with\u2014although they can be viewed by anyone. Take, for example, our writer\u2019s shirt. They can claim ownership of it by using the pin code they were given on purchase, as well as see the details of how it was made and its care instructions\u2014all by scanning the QR code on the label. And if they were to try and sell it, potential buyers could verify that it\u2019s an authentic Loro Piana shirt\u2014that the seller owns\u2014by looking it up on the Aura Blockchain Consortium before its ownership is officially transferred\u2014with this transfer being recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see.\nCreated in April 2021, the Aura Blockchain Consortium was built in an effort to innovate, push sustainability (it\u2019s pledged to be carbon neutral by 2025), and give customers transparency.\nThe use of blockchain technology in luxury markets has two obvious upsides: It will be harder for scammers to try and pass off fake luxury goods as genuine items when they don\u2019t have the proper QR code. Sellers of stolen luxury goods will also have a hard time when the blockchain shows that they don\u2019t own what they\u2019re selling.For Loro Piana, the use of the blockchain is a natural next step in its technical evolution, since it\u2019s one of the few luxury fashion companies to be vertically integrated. It has grown over the years from a family of wool fabric merchants in the 19th century to the innovator it is today\u2014a company that controls its entire production process. Today, Loro Piana sources its own raw materials, manufactures them, and retails its wears, offering its customers a unique end product that has been quality controlled all the way back to the fiber it\u2019s made from.\nNot every Loro Piana item is certified via the Aura Blockchain Consortium\u2014yet. The luxury brand is rolling out the technology starting with its most exclusive offering: those made from the finest merino wool there is, The Gift of Kings®. Specifically, its Spring\/Summer 2023 The Gift of Kings® Ready to Wear collection, as well as 20 individual The Gift of Kings® pieces that will be sold at its new Palo Alto store to celebrate its launch\u2014and which come with their own exclusive NFTs created by artist Charlotte Taylor, which can only be transferred if the garment\u2019s ownership is transferred.\nProducts made with The Gift of Kings® wool fiber are highly sought after, seeing as there are just over 4,400 pounds of it produced every year by Loro Piana\u2019s local breeding partners in Australia and New Zealand. Loro Piana holds its annual Record Bale event to award one of these wool breeders the title of \u201CFinest Merino Wool in the World\u201D\u2014with the all-time record being 10.3 microns. The Gift of Kings® fibers are, on average, around 12 microns thick (our writer\u2019s shirt fibers are 12.6 microns in diameter, according to its entry on the Aura Blockchain Consortium). Compare this to the red blood cell of a human, which is 5 microns, and the average human hair, which is 80-100 microns in diameter, and you can see why it\u2019s so special\u2014and worthy of digital authentication and certification.\nThe Gift of Kings® collection being added to the Aura Blockchain Consortium is just the start for Loro Piana\u2014it plans to roll out the technology across its Excellences collections in the future. But, for now, it\u2019s exciting to see how this new technology could revolutionize the fashion industry and give customers like our writer the transparency they crave in a digital world.\n1 \/ 5\nThe shorn wool is scoured to remove any dirt or dust before being packaged and shipped to the manufacturing facilities in Italy.\nThis story was produced by WIRED Brand Lab for Loro Piana.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/640660ebb66dcce8cbc808ab\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/SS23%2520GOK%252036%2520Traceability%2520card.jpg","author":null,"title":" Loro Piana Is Shepherding the Future of Fashion Thanks to Blockchain Technology","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/loro-piana-is-shepherding-the-future-of-fashion-thanks-to-blockchain-technology\/","tags":[""]},{"date":"10.09.2023","summary":"The same chaotic day FTX declared bankruptcy, someone began stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from its coffers. A WIRED investigation reveals the company\u2019s \u201Cvery crazy night\u201D trying to stop them.","post_content":"BY THE EVENING of November 11 of last year, FTX\u2019s staff had already endured one of the worst days in the company\u2019s short life. What had recently been one of the world's top cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at $32 billion only 10 months earlier, had just declared bankruptcy. Executives had, after an extended struggle, persuaded the company's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to hand over the reins to John Ray III, a new chief executive now tasked with shepherding the company through a nightmarish thicket of debts, many of which it seemed to have no means to pay.\nFTX had, it seemed, hit rock bottom. Until someone\u2014a thief or thieves who have yet to be identified\u2014chose that particular moment to make things far worse. That Friday evening, exhausted FTX staffers began to see mysterious outflows of the company's cryptocurrency, publicly captured on the Etherscan website that tracks the Ethereum blockchain, representing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto being stolen in real time.\n\u201CHoly shit,\u201D one former FTX staffer, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak about internal company matters, remembers thinking. \u201CAfter all this, we\u2019re being hacked?\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nAccording to its own accounting, FTX would ultimately lose between $415 million and $432 million worth of its cryptocurrency holdings to those unidentified thieves, numbers it has publicly confirmed as part of its bankruptcy process. What FTX hasn't previously revealed is how close it may have come to losing vastly more\u2014how its staff and outside consultants raced to move more than $1 billion worth of crypto to more secure storage before it could be stolen by the malevolent presence on its network\u2014even, at one point, scrambling to send close to half a billion dollars to a physical USB drive in one consultant's office in an effort to keep it out of the thieves' hands.\n\u201CInvitation: Urgent\u201D\nAs the trial of FTX's disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried enters its second week, many in the cryptocurrency community are closely watching courtroom events for any hint of how the exchange was so catastrophically looted, just hours after it left his control. The question of who carried out that theft\u2014and whether the thieves were FTX insiders or external hackers\u2014looms largest of all. That mystery remains unsolved, and neither Bankman-Fried nor other top FTX executives have been charged with that theft.\nSign Up Today\nKeep up-to-date with the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried by signing up for our Daily newsletter.\nBut now, WIRED can reveal the events of FTX\u2019s panicky night working to limit the damage from that theft\u2014and to prevent what might otherwise have been a 10-figure heist. The new FTX leadership under Ray, its new CEO, declined to be interviewed about the incident. But WIRED learned the hour-by-hour details of the crisis response from a detailed invoice submitted by the restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsall for its work on FTX's bankruptcy case, interviews with individuals who participated in the immediate response to the theft, and blockchain analysis provided by the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic.\nThat response started around 10 pm on the evening of November 11, when Zach Dexter, the chief executive of FTX subsidiary LedgerX, sent a Google Meet invite to a group of more than 20 of FTX\u2019s remaining staff, bankruptcy lawyers, advisers, and consultants. The invitation\u2019s one-word subject line: \u201Curgent.\u201D\nA handful of staffers quickly joined that Google Meet video call, which would eventually grow to dozens of participants over the next 12 hours. They could all see FTX wallets being drained in real time on Etherscan. But almost no one on the call had any idea where exactly FTX stored its cryptocurrency or how it managed the secret keys that controlled those wallets. That knowledge was held only by a small group of FTX elite\u2014Bankman-Fried and his inner circle. Bankman-Fried never appeared in the meeting, according to sources who were present, but Gary Wang, the FTX cofounder and CTO, did join the call.By this point Wang was distrusted by many people close to Ray, sources say. In the midst of FTX\u2019s meltdown, Wang had initially sided with Bankman-Fried and had only distanced himself from the former CEO after days of persuasion from others within the company.\nWang didn't win over any of his critics in the emergency meeting when he initially suggested the ongoing theft could be halted by simply changing the secret keys that protected the wallets that were being emptied. That seemed pointless, the former FTX staffer remembers thinking, given that whoever had gained access to the network could simply grab the new keys and continue their heist. \u201CThe fox is in the hen house, and you\u2019re going to change the keys to the hen house?\u201D the former staffer remembers thinking. Wang, who has since pleaded guilty to the same criminal charges Bankman-Fried now faces, did not respond to a request for comment sent to his attorney\nJust as the Google Meet call started, however, LedgerX\u2019s Dexter had started exploring a different approach to protecting FTX\u2019s funds. The week before the theft, digital asset trust company BitGo had been negotiating with Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm overseeing FTX\u2019s bankruptcy process, to take custody of the firm\u2019s remaining cryptocurrency holdings. So Dexter now called BitGo to try to circumvent the long legal contract process Sullivan & Cromwell had begun with the company. Instead, Dexter asked BitGo to immediately create \u201Ccold storage\u201D wallets\u2014wallets that would be kept securely offline\u2014that FTX could move all its remaining funds into as a safe haven. Dexter did not respond to a request for comment.\nBitGo said it could have the wallets ready in around half an hour. FTX staffers worried that this would still be too slow. The thieves could potentially take hundreds of millions of dollars more worth of crypto out of the company\u2019s wallets by then.\nSomeone on the Google Meet call asked if anyone had a hardware wallet of their own where the money could be stored until BitGo was ready. Kumanan Ramanathan, an adviser to FTX from Alvarez & Marsall calling in from his house in the suburbs of New York, volunteered. He had a Ledger Nano\u2014a USB drive hardware wallet\u2014in his home office that he offered to set up as a temporary refuge for the vulnerable money.\nRamanathan set up a new wallet on his Ledger Nano at around 10:30 pm ET on November 11. The former FTX staffer remembers watching him check and double-check the password that he'd created for that wallet. Wang began sending FTX\u2019s funds to it, and soon Ramanathan was holding between $400 and $500 million in the company\u2019s crypto assets on a USB drive in his Westchester County home.\nA Late-Night 911 Call\nMinutes later, BitGo told the FTX staffers that its wallets were ready, and they began transferring hundreds of millions more in crypto to BitGo\u2019s cold storage instead of Ramanathan's Ledger device. For the rest of that sleepless night, the staffers hunted for every wallet where FTX\u2019s money was stored and transferred every coin they could find to BitGo. \u201CThey were scrubbing various systems trying to find where various private keys were, where assets were held,\u201D says another person involved in the response, granted anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak about it publicly. \u201CIt was just chaos.\u201D\nAs FTX's staff focused on getting executives to sign off on those transfers of potentially vulnerable funds, Ramanathan was left holding the crypto that Wang had initially transferred to his Ledger wallet. That created the bizarre situation of an individual physically possessing around half a billion dollars worth of FTX's money, which presented its own unique legal and security risks. That night, Ryne Miller, the general counsel for FTX, rushed to Ramanathan's home to help safeguard it. Ryne Miller declined to comment for this story, and Ramanathan didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.At 10:59 pm Ramanathan called the police to report a theft in progress and explain that he was holding a very large amount of the victim's money, requesting that officers come to his house to help protect it. After all, no one knew then\u2014or now\u2014who had stolen the other funds, and if they might try to physically take the stash that Ramanathan held too. A police report from the New Rochelle Police Department obtained by WIRED shows that Ramanathan told the 911 dispatcher that \u201Cthere is a huge crypto hit currently going on and that there is a large amount of money being sent to this address\u201D and that he \u201Cfears the house is going to become a target.\u201D\nEven after the police arrived, Miller, FTX's general counsel, stayed at the house for most of the night. Ramanathan's record of billable hours shows that he and Miller spent nearly three and half hours in his home, from around 2 am to 5 am, on November 12.\nNo physical threat to Ramanathan or his home materialized. In fact, the siphoning of funds from FTX had stopped when the money was moved to Ramanathan's Ledger wallet. \u201CHe took a huge fucking risk using his personal Ledger,\u201D says the former FTX staffer. \u201CHe\u2019s a total boss. It\u2019s my pretty strong feeling that if we hadn\u2019t pulled this Ledger stunt, we would have lost significantly more money.\u201D The money in Ramanathan's home office was finally transferred to BitGo by around 5 am on Saturday, November 12. The company would ultimately hold $1.1 billion of the remaining FTX funds.\nLater on Saturday, Bankman-Fried and Wang transferred another $400 million plus to accounts under the control of the Bahamas government for safeguarding, as reported by Forbes and recorded in a court filing. At some points, that movement of funds to the Bahamas appears to have been confused with the theft itself. A week after the theft, some media outlets incorrectly reported that the stolen funds had actually been seized by the Bahamian government. As evidence to the contrary, cryptocurrency tracing firms like Elliptic and Chainalysis have observed portions of the actual stolen funds being sent to \u201Cmixing\u201D services often used to launder stolen crypto funds such as Railgun and the cross-blockchain coin swap service THORChain, behavior typical of thieves who pull off large-scale crypto heists.\nFew Safeguards, No Map\nIn the months since the desperate rescue effort of November 11, FTX\u2019s new regime, which is handling the company\u2019s bankruptcy process, has publicly alleged glaring security failings that made the theft possible.\nAn April report released as part of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings listed examples of that alleged neglect: The previous FTX regime had no independent chief information security officer or actual dedicated security team; it kept virtually all its cryptocurrency in hot wallets\u2014wallets on computers connected to the internet\u2014despite employees being instructed to publicly claim that it stored as little as 10 percent in hot wallets; it left keys to those wallets unencrypted or failed to properly set up security systems where multiple keys are needed to unlock funds; and it lacked the logging systems to even know who was moving funds and when, along with many other issues.The same report describes the impossible situation that the new FTX regime faced on November 11, when, in its first day in charge, it discovered it had inherited a deeply compromised network. \u201CDue to the FTX Group\u2019s deficient controls to secure crypto assets, the Debtors faced the threat that billions of dollars of additional assets could be lost at any moment,\u201D the report reads, using the term \u201Cdebtors\u201D to describe the new FTX administration led by Ray. \u201CAs the Debtors worked to identify and access crypto assets with no \u2018map\u2019 to guide them, the Debtors had to engineer technological pathways to transfer many types of assets they identified to cold storage.\u201D\nGiven that apparently shambolic security and disorganization, it\u2019s perhaps not a surprise that FTX became the target of one of the costliest crypto heists in history. But if not for a few quick decisions in the midst of that chaos, it now appears that it could have been far worse.\n\u201CIt was a very, very crazy night,\u201D the former FTX staffer says. \u201CWe worked on it, we got it done, and we saved a massive amount of customers\u2019 money.\u201D\nUpdated at 10:35 am ET, October 10, 2023, to clarify THORChain's functionality.\nUpdated at 3:50 pm ET, October 10, 2023, to add details from a New Rochelle Police Department report detailing Ramanathan's 911 call. We also clarified that Ramanathan and Miller were at Ramanathan's home when the 911 call took place and while they awaited the transfer to BitGo.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65203361f9c5320e83248c07\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Amid-Bankruptcy%2C-How-FTX-Scrambled-To-Save-$1-Billion-From-Thieves-Security-Alamy-2HFBNJT.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Inside FTX\u2019s All-Night Race to Stop a $1 Billion Crypto Heist","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-1-billion-crypto-heist\/","tags":["","FTX TRIAL","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CYBERSECURITY","CRIME"]},{"date":"05.04.2024","summary":"Plus: An assassination plot, an AI security bill, a Project Nimbus revelation, and more of the week\u2019s top security news.","post_content":"This week, WIRED reported that a group of prolific scammers known as the Yahoo Boys are openly operating on major platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, TikTok, and Telegram.

Now a second group is demanding money, and it has sent WIRED samples of what they claim is the company's stolen data.","post_content":"For months, Change Healthcare has faced an immensely messy ransomware debacle that has left hundreds of pharmacies and medical practices across the United States unable to process claims. Now, thanks to an apparent dispute within the ransomware criminal ecosystem, it may have just become far messier still.\nIn March, the ransomware group AlphV, which had claimed credit for encrypting Change Healthcare\u2019s network and threatened to leak reams of the company\u2019s sensitive health care data, received a $22 million payment\u2014evidence, publicly captured on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, that Change Healthcare had very likely caved to its tormentors\u2019 ransom demand, though the company has yet to confirm that it paid. But in a new definition of a worst-case ransomware, a different ransomware group claims to be holding Change Healthcare\u2019s stolen data and is demanding a payment of their own.\nSince Monday, RansomHub, a relatively new ransomware group, has posted to its dark-web site that it has 4 terabytes of Change Healthcare\u2019s stolen data, which it threatened to sell to the \u201Chighest bidder\u201D if Change Healthcare didn\u2019t pay an unspecified ransom. RansomHub tells WIRED it is not affiliated with AlphV and \u201Ccan\u2019t say\u201D how much it\u2019s demanding as a ransom payment.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nForensics Expert Answers Crime Scene Questions From Twitter\nRansomHub initially declined to publish or provide WIRED any sample data from that stolen trove to prove its claim. But on Friday, a representative for the group sent WIRED several screenshots of what appeared to be patient records and a data-sharing contract for United Healthcare, which owns Change Healthcare, and Emdeon, which acquired Change Healthcare in 2014 and later took its name.\nWhile WIRED could not fully confirm RansomHub\u2019s claims, the samples suggest that this second extortion attempt against Change Healthcare may be more than an empty threat. \u201CFor anyone doubting that we have the data, and to anyone speculating the criticality and the sensitivity of the data, the images should be enough to show the magnitude and importance of the situation and clear the unrealistic and childish theories,\u201D the RansomHub contact tells WIRED in an email.\n\u201CWe are working with law enforcement and outside experts to investigate claims posted online to understand the extent of potentially impacted data,\u201D Change Healthcare said in an email to WIRED. \u201COur investigation remains active and ongoing. There is no evidence of any new cyber incident at Change Healthcare.\u201D\nBrett Callow, a ransomware analyst with security firm Emsisoft, says he believes AlphV did not originally publish any data from the incident, and the origin of RansomHub\u2019s data is unclear. \u201CI obviously don't know whether the data is real\u2014it could have been pulled from elsewhere\u2014but nor do I see anything that indicates it may not be authentic,\u201D he says of the data shared by RansomHub.\nJon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at threat intelligence firm Analyst1, says he believes RansomHub is \u201Ctelling the truth and does have Change HealthCare\u2019s data,\u201D after reviewing the information sent to WIRED. While RansomHub is a new ransomware threat actor, DiMaggio says, they are quickly \u201Cgaining momentum.\u201D\nIf RansomHub\u2019s claims are real, it will mean that Change Healthcare\u2019s already catastrophic ransomware ordeal has become a kind of cautionary tale about the dangers of trusting ransomware groups to follow through on their promises, even after a ransom is paid. In March, someone who goes by the name \u201Cnotchy\u201D posted to a Russian cybercriminal forum that AlphV had pocketed that $22 million payment and disappeared without sharing a commission with the \u201Caffiliate\u201D hackers who typically partner with ransomware groups and often penetrate victims\u2019 networks on their behalf.Notchy\u2019s post suggested that Change Healthcare faced an unprecedented situation: It had allegedly already paid a ransom, yet jilted partners of the gang extorting it still felt they were owed money\u2014and still possessed Change Healthcare\u2019s stolen data. RansomHub tells WIRED it is associated with notchy.\nNow, RansomHub has claimed \u201Cthe data remains with the affiliate,\u201D and AlphV did not directly have the data originally. WIRED could not verify these claims. \u201CFor everyone speculating and theorizing on the situation, AlphV stole our share of the payment and performed an exit scam,\u201D a RansomHub representative wrote to WIRED. \u201CAlphV performed the exit scam before we get to the data deletion part.\u201D\nCallow says the incident reinforces that cybercriminals can\u2019t be trusted to delete data, even when they are paid. For example, when a global law enforcement operation disrupted the notorious LockBit ransomware group, in February, police said they discovered that the cybercriminals still had data that investigators had paid to be deleted.\n\u201CSometimes they use the undeleted data to extort victims for a second time, and the risk of re-extortion will only increase as law enforcement up their disruption efforts and throw the ransomware ecosystem into chaos,\u201D Callow says. \u201CWhat were always unpredictable outcomes will now be even more unpredictable.\u201D\nSimilarly, DiMaggio says victims of ransomware attacks need to learn they can\u2019t trust cybercriminals. \u201CVictims need to understand that paying a criminal who promises to delete their data permanently is a myth,\u201D DiMaggio says. \u201CThey are paying to have their data taken off the public side of the ransomware attackers data leak site. They should assume it is never actually deleted.\u201D\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s website says it is continuing to \u201Cmake progress in mitigating the impact\u201D of the attack and expanding financial assistance to health care providers that have been impacted. However, the attack has sent long-lasting ripples across medical facilities in the United States, demonstrating how disruptive ransomware attacks can be and the difficulties in restoring services. Clinicians and patients alike have been impacted, with extra strain being placed upon medical business owners.\nOn Wednesday, the American Medical Association said \u201Cserious disruptions continue\u201D across physician practices. A survey of AMA members, conducted between March 26 and April 3, found 80 percent of clinicians had lost revenue and many are using their own personal finances to cover a practice\u2019s expenses. Medical practitioners responding to the survey said they were heading toward bankruptcy, were struggling to \u201Cmanage pain care\u201D for cancer patients, and that procedures had been delayed. \u201CPractices will close because of this incident,\u201D Jesse M.

Nope, I hated that.\n[Laughter]\nLauren Goode: Three, two, one. Hi, I'm Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And I'm Gideon Lichfield. And this is Have a Nice Future, a podcast about how terrifyingly fast everything is changing.\nLauren Goode: Each week we talk to someone with big, audacious, and sometimes unnerving ideas about the future, and we ask them how we can all prepare to live in it.\nGideon Lichfield: Our guest this week is Luukas Ilves. He is the chief information officer of the government of Estonia, which people often talk about as one of the most digitally advanced governments in the world.\nLuukas Ilves (audio clip): The fact that other countries in a couple of years time can look at what we've done, learn these lessons, and then kind of catapult themselves into being the same league with us, that gives me ground for optimism that actually governments can get better at this.Lauren Goode: So Gideon, I've heard passing references to Estonia as this magical, futuristic place where everything runs on the blockchain or something. But I have to confess, I know very little about Estonia. I am going to be the proxy today for audience members listening to this who are like, \u201CI know nothing about Estonia, tell me.\u201D\nGideon Lichfield: That is your job.\nLauren Goode: That's my job.\n[Chuckle]\nGideon Lichfield: OK, well, so let me ask you something. In the last five years or so, how many times do you think you have filled in exactly the same information: your name, address, phone, email, social security number, health conditions, whatever, every single time you've gone to see a new doctor or applied for a driver's license, or done pretty much any other bit of bureaucracy?\nLauren Goode: A lot. A hundred. You're saying within the past year? I can't even begin to count.\nGideon Lichfield: Or five \u2026 However long. Yes.\nLauren Goode: I can't begin to remember. That's actually just called adulting.\nGideon Lichfield: That's why it's so hard.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nGideon Lichfield: So what if you never had to do that again? You show up at a new doctor's office or at City Hall or at the bank, and you just prove to them that you are you, and they say, \u201COK, thank you Ms. Goode. Just tap here to accept our services, and we will have all the data on you that we need.\u201D\nLauren Goode: So it's like Apple Pay for government?\nGideon Lichfield: Sure, if you want.\nLauren Goode: I think this is good as long as the data is secure.\nGideon Lichfield: Yeah. So what Estonia has is this advanced system for permissioning data. Different bits of the government, and also different private companies, all have data on you. But you can decide who gets to see which data from which place. This system they call the X-Road is basically a backbone for transferring data between different entities. And what's more, you not only can give permission to individual people or entities to see bits of your data, you can also see who has looked at it every single time, so you have total transparency into how your data is being used, which you certainly don't here in the US.\nLauren Goode: Ah, that must be where the blockchain comes in.\nGideon Lichfield: Somewhere in there the blockchain comes in. Yeah. It's possibly the first use of a blockchain I've actually believed in.\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: So let's go even further. Let's say you don't have to file your taxes\u2014\nLauren Goode: I'm listening.\nGideon Lichfield: You just get a notification from the government that your tax return is ready, you take a look, and if it looks good to you, you click accept, and your taxes are done.Lauren Goode: What if they don't look good?\nGideon Lichfield: Then you can change them.\nLauren Goode: OK. I'm just saying if you have, like, a quibble about something.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes.\nLauren Goode: OK. I like the sound of this too.\nGideon Lichfield: And now let's imagine you're eligible for some kind of state benefit, like disability or an education grant or childcare but you don't have to apply for it, you don't even have to know it exists, you just get a notification from the government saying that you qualify for this thing, do you want it? If yes, click here.\nLauren Goode: How does the government know you're about to have a baby? Are they spying?\nGideon Lichfield: [Chuckle] No, but if it knows you've had a baby, if you've been to the hospital and registered a birth\u2014\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: Then they\u2014\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: Kick in automatically.\nLauren Goode: OK, so there's one side of this that sounds a little bit Big Brother, and then there's another part of me that thinks this is probably how a fully digitized government should work.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. It's kind of like Steve Jobs used to say about Apple products, \u201CIt should just work.\u201D\nLauren Goode: And so, Luukas' job is to make this all work?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, not his job alone, but he is the guy in charge of overseeing the digital transformation that started about 30 years ago, and continuing to advance it across all the government.\nLauren Goode: Estonia is pretty small though, right? So to ask a question that perhaps a Silicon Valley VC would ask, can it scale? Is this something that the United States could conceivably do?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to Luukas about. Because Estonia is seen as this poster child for digital government, to the point where it's kind of become a cliché. People say, \u201COh, yeah, Estonia.\u201D But good luck trying to replicate what Estonia does anywhere else. I basically wanted to ask Luukas how exportable is the Estonian model. And he seemed to think it wasn't as unique to Estonia as you might imagine.\nLauren Goode: Well, I can't wait to hear this.\nGideon Lichfield: And that conversation is coming up right after the break.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Luukas Ilves, welcome to Have a Nice Future.\nLuukas Ilves: Thanks, Gideon, it's a pleasure to be on.\nGideon Lichfield: Are you having a nice future?\nLuukas Ilves: I am. Although for me, it's my present.\nGideon Lichfield: I think most of our listeners probably have heard that Estonia is a pioneer in digital government, but they don't know much about what that means in practice. So can you briefly talk about the key things that make it a leader?Luukas Ilves: Sure. I mean, the headline point is really simple, which is just that everything's digital. There isn't a government service or an interaction between citizen or business and government that hasn't been digitized at this point. So everything from the mundane that should be digital at this point in pretty much every country in the world, like filing your taxes, permitting of any kind to\u2014you know, some things that are a bit less digitized in most parts of the world, such as voting, where we've been able to vote online since 2004, and in our most recent elections, more than half of people did. And of course beyond just digitizing things, we have a very strong focus on taking advantage of all the sort of, the tools that new tech gives us to constantly make stuff better, whether that's better from the perspective of transparency and accountability, convenience, or cost effectiveness. So in some ways, I'd say it's almost unremarkable. We do in government what pretty much everyone in the world everywhere does with digital transformation, which is to find ways to constantly get better at what they're doing using the technologies of the day.\nGideon Lichfield: Estonia has been on this journey of digitizing government for about 30 years, so how did it get started, and why do you think it got a head start on so many other places?\nLuukas Ilves: Well, the interesting thing is we didn't get a head start, we had a very late start. So when did the US start digitizing government? Late \u201840s or the early \u201950s with a bunch of mainframes. And even countries that you don't think of as being wealthier, super technologically advanced, have been doing digital government, at least in the sense of having government mainframes running back-office processes since the 1960s. Estonia was forcibly occupied by the Soviet Union until 1991, and so in a sense, a lot of our government processes were much more backward technologically. And when we regained our independence in 1991, we effectively had a clean reboot of a lot of how government functioned, and so we got lucky in timing. We started at a time where the thinking had just radically shifted in terms of what providing a service means. We were in the era of the internet. And the second is that we didn't have a lot in the way of resources. So we couldn't just sort of take 1980s enterprise IT, because we didn't have the ability to afford IBM and Accenture to come in and build that for us. And so, you know, initially, a lot of what we did was bootstrapped, and at the time fairly young tech guys figuring out very organically, well, what makes sense, what kind of fits our functional requirements?\nGideon Lichfield: Let's talk about some of the implications of what that actually means for users of government services. So Estonia has this principle that no piece of data should have to be entered twice. How does that change the experience for people compared with a country like sitting here in the US, every time you go to see a different doctor, you have to fill in forms all over again?Luukas Ilves: That's right. So that's what we call the once-only principle. If the government has asked you for a piece of data, they don't have a right to ask you for that same data again in a different context. So that means prefilled tax declarations, where Estonians like to compete on how long it takes them to declare their taxes, and what they're really competing on is who's faster at logging on to the tax service, pressing accept, and being done.\nGideon Lichfield: How long does it take then to file one's taxes?\nLuukas Ilves: If you don't actually look at the declaration, you can do it in about 15 seconds. So what's happening in the background there is that we have a pretty good taxonomy of the data that government has, and when one public body has a reason to use data, then they go and query that from another public body based on the legal authorization they have to use that data. But the benefits aren't just around convenience. It makes our public services work more effectively, it reduces a lot of error, and a lot of the sort of difficulties in public service delivery where disadvantaged populations might not get access to a service because they don't know about some kind of an opportunity or an entitlement\u2014that you can sort of do away with. It reduces a lot of opportunities for fraud on the one hand, but also corruption on the part of officials. And it also, we at least think, makes us better at protecting our citizens' data, because instead of having massive amounts of data over-collected everywhere and generally not necessarily thawed and safeguarded too well, if we've got a piece of sensitive data, then we focus on keeping that well protected in one context, making sure the access rules are strictly enforced and making sure the right protections are in place, and then giving our citizens transparency on how that data is actually used.\nGideon Lichfield: So my sense from having visited Estonia a number of times over the last couple of decades, it's a pretty technologically literate country. But there will always be some people, and especially the elderly, who find digital services a little harder to handle, or who are especially vulnerable to hacking and having their data compromised. How do you help those people, and how do you make sure nobody's getting left behind?\nLuukas Ilves: So there's a two-part answer. The first, of course, is how you actually build your digital services to address these problems. So it's a basic, first of all, user design question, where you can have very complex services that can still be easy to use or that can be a nightmare to use. And the same thing is true for instance, for questions around identity theft or hacking. Part of having a security ID is it puts additional barriers in place to some of the usual ways in which credentials would get stolen. So for part of the elderly population, you're gonna solve that question by having easy-to-use convenient services that don't create those problems. And by the way, it's not just an elderly question, if we look at the largest proportion of calls to our help lines are actually from people in the age bracket of 18 to 25, because a lot of how government agencies design services, even Estonia, isn't really built for how Gen Z, which only uses mobile devices, which has a different expectation of user experience, how they're used to using services. So it's not always the case that younger means that they have an easier time using a service. But for the elderly, you're never gonna hit 100 percent. You're always going to have people with enough cognitive or sensory impairment that they really can't use a service, you're going to have people who just refuse to use a service, and we don't force citizens to use digital services, there is always an in-person or paper alternative. But it becomes a numbers game. The more you can move people into the online and automated channels, the more you can take the resources that you would use for in-person interactions to actually make the interaction for the complex cases work better. The idea is not that we move everyone into digitization, but that if we can move 80-20 or 90-10\u2014the vast majority\u2014into digitized automated channels, then we use the resources we have to then deal with the other 5 or the 10 percent in a way that actually pays more attention to their needs and gives them better outcomes.Gideon Lichfield: Right. So it seems like one of the big shifts that is happening at the moment in Estonia is a move to proactive public services, the idea that if you're entitled to some benefit, you shouldn't have to apply for it, it should just appear automatically. Where do you expect that to end up?\nLuukas Ilves: The idea is really quite simple, which is that the triggering conditions for most public services are written in the law somewhere. It can be anything from as mundane as, well, your passport needs to be renewed, to something a bit more sophisticated like means-testing for a public benefit. And if we know that we have the data that determine whether you are entitled to a benefit or should be using some kind of a service, then we're kind of sitting on our hands if we don't reach out to you when those data or those events indicate something should be happening. So the basic idea is just\u2014it's a convenience point, it's as simple as me getting an SMS saying, \u201CHey, your passport's gonna expire in two months, here is a link to renew it.\u201D But as you then start going through more complex events and services, you get into situations where you're notifying people of benefits that they weren't aware they're eligible for, you might in particular be focusing on disadvantaged populations where the information about the availability of these benefits isn't really there. Or you're pushing out things like, for instance, in the case of Covid, where we had additional unemployment benefits and then health benefits and support also for enterprises, you're going to the people that these benefits are meant to target without waiting for them to come to you, which should be contributing to actually achieving the desired outcome\u2014the reason for which those benefits or those targeted forms of support were created in the first place\u2014more effectively.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. I mean, it seems kind of obvious. And yet in most places around the world, it's assumed that if you want something from the government, you have to ask for it.\nLuukas Ilves: Yeah. And there may still be asking for it, I have to ask to have my passport renewed. But why shouldn't the government tell you that, \u201CHey, you can ask for it.\u201D Wouldn't you like to ask for it? Because again, all of these various forms of benefits and services, ostensibly they exist because they're in the public good and because the lawmaker wants them to be used. So if we're kind of funding something, we're creating a legal framework and then we're just failing to tell our users that it's out there, it's really sort of doing 95 percent of the work and then failing in the last 5 percent.\nGideon Lichfield: Let's talk about online voting. This year, Estonians voted, and for the first time, more than half the votes were cast online. Tell us, first of all, how that online voting system works, what makes it secure?","post_cover":null,"author":"BY GIDEON LICHFIELD","title":"How to Digitize an Entire Government","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/have-a-nice-future-podcast-25\/","tags":["","HAVE A NICE FUTURE","PODCASTS","GOVERNMENT"]},{"date":"04.10.2023","summary":"Ether is finally untethering itself from mining\u2014and driving renewed debate about bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact.","post_content":"AT 19:27 EASTERN time on April 12, the Ethereum blockchain, home to the world\u2019s second-most-popular cryptocurrency, ether, will finally sever its links to crypto mining. Within the Ethereum bubble, a sense of anticipation is building; some are planning \u201Cviewing parties\u201D for the occasion. Codenamed \u201CShanghai,\u201D the update to Ethereum caps off a process, after \u201CThe Merge,\u201D which fundamentally changes the way transactions are verified and the network secured. \nUnder the old system, proof-of-work (PoW) mining, the right to process a batch of transactions and earn a crypto reward is determined by a race to solve a mathematical puzzle. The greater the computing power miners throw at the problem, the greater their chance of winning the race. Under Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake (PoS) system, there is no race and there are no miners; instead, the winner is determined by raffle. The greater the amount of ether somebody locks up on the network\u2014or stakes\u2014the greater the chance they hold a prize-winning ticket.\nBy demonstrating that a large-scale blockchain can shift from one system to another, Shanghai will reignite a debate over whether the practice of mining that still supports bitcoin, the most widely traded cryptocurrency, is viable and sustainable. Figures from the University of Cambridge suggest the Bitcoin network consumed 107 terawatt-hours of energy in 2022\u2014equivalent to that of the Netherlands\u2014of which only just over a quarter came from renewable sources. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum consumed roughly two-thirds as much energy as the Bitcoin network. But the move away from mining has cut that consumption, according to analysis by Alex de Vries, data scientist at De Nederlandsche Bank and creator of Digiconomist, a source of crypto emissions data, by at least 99.84 percent.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\n\u201CThe energy consumption problem is Bitcoin\u2019s achilles heel,\u201D says de Vries. \u201CIt\u2019s a simple fact that as the price of bitcoin gets higher, the energy consumption problem gets worse. The more money miners make, the more they will typically spend on resources: hardware and electricity.\nBut many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And, they say, PoS is inferior to PoW\u2014prone to centralization (crypto\u2019s great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces, like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of crypto.\nIn bitcoin\u2019s infancy, the cryptocurrency could be mined effectively with just a personal computer and simple software. But as the level of appetite for bitcoin increased, the industry professionalized. Today, the mining scene is dominated by large companies\u2014some publicly traded, like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain\u2014that operate gargantuan facilities with rack upon rack of hardware. The largest of these mines, many of which are located in Texas, can draw upwards of 700 MW of power.But bitcoin proponents claim that looking at the absolute amount of energy that the industry consumes misses important context. Far from triggering investment in new fossil-fuel plants, miners say they are incentivizing renewable energy development, by plugging the gaps when demand is low.\n\u201COnly the miners with the cheapest energy can survive, so bitcoin is driven to areas of low or no demand,\u201D says Yan Pritzker, cofounder of the bitcoin trading platform Swan Bitcoin. \u201CSources of wind and solar are unreliable and therefore have to be overprovisioned. But bitcoin miners are coming in and acting as a buyer of last resort.\u201D\nBy purchasing energy from renewable sources when it isn\u2019t needed by the grid, the argument goes, bitcoin miners can increase the profitability of solar and wind farms and accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources. Miners also say consumption figures like those compiled by the University of Cambridge don\u2019t take into account the amount of off-grid energy sources used to power mining, nor the circa 1 percent that run on methane\u2014a byproduct of oil extraction that is otherwise vented or burned away.\nA common argument among bitcoiners is that rather than focusing on trying to cut down how much energy is consumed by the network, critics should look at how the network can help expand the amount of renewable energy on the grid. \u201CBitcoiners understand that the way to reduce emissions is not to use less energy, but to generate orders of magnitude more low-emissions electricity,\u201D says Chris Bendiksen, bitcoin research lead at investment firm CoinShares. \u201CIn order to do that, producing low-emission energy must be profitable, something that PoW mining ensures in a wholly unique manner and at scale.\u201D\nAlthough compelling at a surface level, these arguments do not stand up to scrutiny, say bitcoin critics. Pete Howson, an assistant professor on the Environmental Sciences faculty at Northumbria University, likens the common defenses of bitcoin mining to \u201Cmagic tricks''\u2014sleights of hand that obscure inconvenient truths and \u201Cprovide the illusion of clean and profitable investment.\u201D\n\u201CThe only difference between flaring methane and flaring methane for bitcoin,\u201D says Howson, \u201Cis that the latter makes fossil-fuel companies more profitable, slowing the transition to green alternatives.\u201D There are even a handful of examples\u2014in New York and Montana\u2014of the additional revenue generated by bitcoin mining giving new life to fossil-fuel plants that had either closed or were scheduled for closure.\nMeanwhile, in countries like Iceland, Howson says, bitcoin miners are outcompeting other energy consumers, like recycling plants, which \u201Ccan\u2019t get access\u201D to otherwise plentiful sources of renewable energy. \u201CThere is no such thing as wasting energy sustainably,\u201D he says.\nWhether it\u2019s really a waste is at the core of the debate.\nThe scrutiny of bitcoin\u2019s environmental credentials, says Pritzker, is out of proportion with the emissions it produces, which best estimates place somewhere between 0.1 percent to 0.15 percent of the global total. He asks why bitcoin is singled out, when other industries pollute in larger volumes or are powered by a dirtier mix of energy. The simple answer is that the argument hinges on a matter of personal opinion; it comes down to whether somebody believes that crypto serves a purpose.If bitcoin is agreed to be of greater societal value than tobacco, say, an industry responsible for a greater volume of emissions, its footprint becomes easier to justify. But if instead, bitcoin is just one big Ponzi scheme, the sums will never line up.\nThis ideological battle, and the strength of the animosity between bitcoin evangelists and their critics, means that it\u2019s hard to have a nuanced discussion about the industry, and both sides have become entrenched in their positions.\nAccording to de Vries, it would be perfectly possible, from a technical perspective, for Bitcoin to follow in the footsteps of the Ethereum network. \u201CBitcoin could move to PoS, no problem,\u201D he says. \u201CBut it\u2019s a social challenge.\u201D\nDe Vries is often attacked by bitcoiners, who claim he is incentivized by his affiliation with central banking to criticize bitcoin, that his data is incorrect, and that he fails to account for the nuances in bitcoin\u2019s relationship with the environment.\nBitcoiners have locked horns with environmental charities. On March 23, activists at Greenpeace unveiled an art installation named the Skull of Satoshi, an allusion to the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Standing 11 feet tall, the skull is decorated with old motherboards, its eye sockets glow red, and chimneys eject smoke from the crown. The installation was intended to represent the dual contribution of crypto mining to carbon emissions and e-waste, says Rolf Skar, campaign director at Greenpeace USA. But the skull was quickly appropriated by bitcoin supporters on Twitter, who described the skull as \u201Cmetal\u201D and \u201Cbadass.\u201D Some used it as a new profile picture. \n\u201CThe reaction was predictable, but disappointing,\u201D says Skar. \u201CIt\u2019s not surprising, but it\u2019s a bad look to trivialize these very real issues.\u201D\nThe artist that designed the sculpture, Benjamin Von Wong, bore some of the backlash too. On March 25, he published a Twitter thread saying that he had revised his \u201Cblack and white\u201D assessment after conversations with bitcoiners. But he also pointed to the forces standing in the way of productive debate: \u201CThere are people on both sides who believe the other is naively optimistic, misguided and misinformed,\u201D he wrote.\nThe Skull of Satoshi, which is being taken on a tour of US cities, is part of a broader Greenpeace campaign called \u201CChange the Code, Not the Climate,\u201D the purpose of which is to push for changes in the Bitcoin code base that would reduce the network\u2019s emissions. Skar says the intention is to prevent fossil-fuel plants from \u201Croaring back to life,\u201D courtesy of bitcoin, but Bendiksen calls the effort a \u201Csmear campaign.\u201D\nBoth parties also accuse the other of bad-faith misrepresentations of facts and data. The Greenpeace campaign, Pritzker and Bendiksen say, is funded in part by Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple, a company with interests in promoting XRP, a cryptocurrency that was launched as a direct competitor to bitcoin. But by the same token, says Howson, arguments in favor of bitcoin mining are often founded on data supplied by the Bitcoin Mining Council, a coalition of mining companies led by Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, a business with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in bitcoin.The impasse is worsened by the ideological opposition to PoS among bitcoiners, separate from the environmental considerations. Some find unthinkable the idea of tampering with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original invention, and others, like Bendiksen and Pritzker, believe PoS introduces greater risk of centralization and censorship\u2014and therefore represents a threat to crypto\u2019s founding principles. \u201CPoS is essentially the fiat system,\u201D says Pritzker, \u201Cbecause whoever has the gold makes the rules.\u201D For this reason, explains Bendiksen, bitcoiners will \u201Cnever agree\u201D to a shift.\n\u201CAny attack on bitcoin is an attack on their morality, values, and often their net worth. This makes everything feel personal,\u201D Von Wong told WIRED. \u201CBecause most people don\u2019t see themselves as intrinsically bad, they feel misjudged and misunderstood, which is a terrible place to start a conversation.\u201D\nThe result is a situation in which both parties lob insults across the void but register none of the legitimate or well-intentioned complaints. Any morsel of information that might be used to discredit the opposition is also seized upon. And Von Wong worries about becoming a morsel himself.\n\u201CThe hardest part about being in the center of a controversy is feeling like a chess piece,\u201D he says. \u201CI don\u2019t feel like I can speak freely in public without someone, somewhere, taking what I say out of context and trying to leverage it against the opposite side.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Update Opens a Rift in Crypto","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ethereum-shanghai-update-crypto-rift\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","ETHEREUM","ENVIRONMENT"]},{"date":"04.02.2024","summary":null,"post_content":"FARUK FATIH ÖZER stood in front of a passport control officer at Istanbul Airport, a line of impatient travelers queuing behind him. He pulled his face mask below his chin for the security camera. Surely he was nervous. The 27-year-old had unruly black hair, a boy-band face, and a patchy beard. Normally he overcompensated for his callow features by dressing in a pressed three-piece suit. But this spring day he wore black trainers and a navy-blue sweater hastily pulled over a white polo shirt, as if he had dressed in a dash. A small backpack was slung over his right shoulder. He looked like someone who could have been going on a last-minute day trip\u2014or someone planning to never come back. At 5:57 pm on April 20, 2021, the guard stamped his Turkish passport and Özer shuffled through the crowd to Gate C, a flash drive containing a rumored $2 billion in crypto stashed in his belongings.\nAfter Özer\u2019s plane reached Tirana, Albania, at 9:24 that night, he checked into the Mondial, a popular 4-star business hotel in the capital\u2019s commercial district. A couple of days later, he looked at his social media accounts. A mob was very angry with him: Customers couldn\u2019t access their money on the exchange Thodex, where he was founder and CEO, and people were accusing him of absconding with their funds.\nÖzer posted a public letter to his company\u2019s website and his social accounts. \u201CI feel compelled to make this statement in order to respond urgently to these allegations,\u201D he wrote. The accusations weren\u2019t true, he said. Thodex\u2014which had nearly half a million investors and $500 million in daily trade volume\u2014was investigating what Özer claimed was a suspected cyberattack that caused \u201Can abnormal fluctuation in the company account.\u201D Assets would be frozen for five days while Thodex resolved the issue. This was terribly bad timing for the big business deal he said he was en route to make: selling the company, or so he had told some employees and his brother and sister before he left. All would be made right. \u201CThere will be no victims,\u201D he promised. \u201CI personally declare that I will return to Turkey within a few days and ensure that the facts are revealed in cooperation with judicial authorities and that I will do my best to prevent users from suffering.\u201D Of course, there was this possibility too: He was in the midst of pulling off the biggest heist in Turkey\u2019s history.\nPHOTOGRAPH: GETTY IMAGESBefore dawn the day after Özer posted the letter, police squads fanned out across Istanbul and public prosecutors opened an investigation. Law enforcement arrested 62 people, including Thodex employees at all levels of the company\u2014and Özer\u2019s older brother and sister, Güven and Serap. Interpol issued a red notice, a request for law enforcement worldwide to find and \u201Cprovisionally arrest\u201D Özer pending his extradition to Turkey. Search teams deployed across Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia. There were reported sightings of the dark-haired young man across Tirana, rumors that he had gone to a poultry farm, that an executive from the Albanian football league was sheltering him. Soon, the Albanian police arrested people accused of aiding and abetting him. But no one seemed to know exactly where Özer was.\nBackgammon cafés, where old men have been drinking tea and talking politics for centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip.\nÖzer had vanished at a particularly precarious time in crypto\u2019s annals: In the weeks leading up to his disappearance, so-called rug pulls\u2014when a cryptocurrency exchange or altcoin developer absconds with investors\u2019 funds\u2014had crypto investors around the globe flabbergasted. The CEO of Mirror Trading International, a crypto trading company based in South Africa, defrauded users of more than $1 billion, then skipped town; TurtleDex, an anonymous decentralized finance storage project on Binance, reportedly vanished with $2.4 million; another decentralized finance project, Meerkat, reportedly fleeced investors out of $31 million (of which they paid back 95 percent). Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis ranked rug pulls as the primary scam of 2021, accounting for 37 percent of all cryptocurrency scam revenue that year, up from 1 percent the year before.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nThodex was at the top of that roster, and nearly every major outlet from Bloomberg to Newsweek published headlines like \u201CTurkish Crypto Exchange Goes Bust as Founder Flees Country\u201D and \u201CTurkish Cryptocurrency Founder Faruk Fatih Özer Seen Fleeing Country With Suspected $2 Billion From Investors.\u201D CoinGeek called it \u201Cthe biggest scam in the digital asset industry in 2021.\u201D The New York Times\u2019 headline read, \u201CPossible Cryptocurrency Fraud Is Another Blow to Turkey\u2019s Financial Stability.\u201D In Turkey, the country I now call home, people were reeling: For years, crypto had been built up\u2014largely by Özer but by others too\u2014as a way out of economic volatility. Now it seemed like just another way to lose your life savings. But something felt off to me, like the whole story wasn\u2019t being told.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRFaruk was born in February 1994, the youngest of three. He was inseparable from his brother, Güven, and sister, Serap. They grew up camping, playing video games, and cooking together. Friends always pointed out their shared sense of humor. His parents ran a print and copy shop in the city of Kocaeli, down the street from their house. They were observant Muslims who gave their children meaningful names: \u201Ctrust\u201D (Güven), \u201Cmirage\u201D (Serap), and \u201Cthe one who distinguishes between right and wrong\u201D (Faruk).\nKocaeli is an industrial port town about 100 kilometers east of Istanbul surrounded by a checkerboard of tobacco and sugar beet fields, petrochemical plants, and paper mills. Roman emperors once lived there, and their crumbling fortress walls still wind through the landscape. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed, Kocaeli became a manufacturing boomtown, and its residents muscled the newly minted Republic of Turkey into the Industrial Revolution.\nWhen Özer was born, Turkey\u2019s economy was in a tailspin. A fragile financial system, irresponsible borrowing, and political corruption had triggered a brief period of triple-digit inflation. The lira\u2019s volatility threatened the savings of its entire population. So many people moved their domestic assets to foreign-currency deposits that, by the end of the year, an astonishing 50 percent of bank deposits in Turkey were in a foreign currency. The year before, that figure was just 1 percent.\nThat same month Özer was born, a charismatic orator with a sympathetic gaze and push-broom mustache began campaigning through Istanbul\u2019s streets in a paisley kipper tie. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan railed against the secular elite who had led the country to near economic collapse. A devout Muslim, he walked the streets of his home neighborhood, Kasımpaşa, a hardscrabble district where he grew up selling simit, or sesame bread, promising reform. In an upset election, he coasted into the role of mayor of Istanbul.\nAround the same time, two Turkish business moguls launched Turkcell, the nation\u2019s first mobile communication system. (This was a year and a half before the same technology was released in the US.) By 2003, Erdoğan was elected prime minister, kicking off a decade of unprecedented growth that foreign observers called Turkey\u2019s \u201CSilent Revolution.\u201D In a turn away from his predecessors, he governed through the lens of a businessman, inaugurating a massive building boom across the country and ultimately wrangling Turkey\u2019s rampant inflation. His pro-business rhetoric boosted the middle class and set Turkey on a path to European Union membership.\nÖzer also caught the spirit of entrepreneurship at an early age. As a teenager in the mid-aughts, he worked after-school shifts at his parents\u2019 print shop. \u201CEver since I was a child, I wanted to do my own business, no matter what sector it was,\u201D he said. At the end of his second year in high school, he decided that further study would not lead him to that dream, so he dropped out.\nBy 2013, Turkey\u2019s gross domestic product had nearly tripled, the lira hovered just above the dollar, and the country was negotiating entry into the EU. BtcTurk, Turkey\u2019s first crypto exchange (and reportedly the world\u2019s fourth), was preparing to launch. Then, in May of that year, a group of activists gathered at Gezi Park in Istanbul to protest plans to redevelop it into a shopping mall with Ottoman-era architecture. They bridled not only at the loss of green space but also at the glorification of Turkey\u2019s Islamist past in a society that called itself secular. Police brutally cracked down on the protesters, sparking a nationwide movement. Within weeks, more than 3 million people had taken part in the demonstrations, their frustration now encompassing the growing authoritarianism of Erdoğan\u2019s government. Thousands were injured, and at least five died. Özer had just turned 19. In the following years, Erdoğan tossed a record number of journalists in jail and censored the internet, and foreign investors recoiled.Around that time, Ismail H. Polat, an expert in engineering, information tech, and new media, was the first person to cover crypto on his YouTube channel. Now a lecturer at Istanbul\u2019s Kadir Has University, the way he tells it, crypto was about trying to be financially free. In those early days, he says, \u201Cit was not the coin, but the spirit.\u201D (After all, bitcoin was worth only $77 at the time.) For young people who felt that Erdoğan had pulled the rug out from under them, whether they knew it explicitly or not, crypto was a new way to protest.\nAt the same time, Özer\u2019s generation was watching as tech startups were taking off around the world. Facebook had bought Instagram for $1 billion, and that spurred entrepreneurs to begin churning out apps. A lot of them were gaming-focused; Candy Crush brought in $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013. The Özers took note.\nBy then, Turkcell had become one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Turkey\u2019s mobile infrastructure and smartphone adoption rate became one of the fastest growing in the world. Polat credits this as the foundation for what came next: The dream began to shift from mere employment to entrepreneurship. Güven cofounded a company called Inline Yazılım; Faruk started one called Inline Teknoloji a few years later and another called Game Bridge after that. The brothers figured out how to crank out chintzy apps\u2014cut-and-paste washboard abs for Instagram photos (pre-vanity-filters era) and addictive gambling games. \u201CI started to sell almost every product that I thought could make a profit on the internet,\u201D he told me. \u201CThis is how I took my first step into business life.\u201D\nBY 2017, 14 years into Erdoğan\u2019s rule, Turkey\u2019s economy had come full circle. Erdoğan\u2019s unorthodox economic policies\u2014repeatedly cutting interest rates\u2014were supposed to raise investment and make Turkey less dependent on foreign powers. Instead they led the country into an economic crisis; the value of the lira hit the skids, and after a failed coup attempt in 2016 people figured it would only get worse. Just as they had 23 years earlier, citizens began searching for places to shelter their money. Voilà, 2017 was also the first year bitcoin\u2019s value shot sky high, from $9,000 to $20,000. Global trade volume also skyrocketed from $99 million to $16 billion.\nBeing early investors in tech wasn\u2019t something that had historically been available to the average person in Turkey. The instant millionaires and billionaires and unicorns pretty much lived elsewhere. Now, Faruk Özer saw a possibility. People in Turkey could shelter their money in what was clearly going to be the next big tech boom. But the biggest opportunity wasn\u2019t in trading coins\u2014it was in running a cryptocurrency exchange. Exchanges collect people\u2019s money and, for a commission, invest it; that gives people who don\u2019t have the time or skills to invest directly into the blockchain a pathway to crypto. Users who go through an exchange don\u2019t even have their own digital wallets; their money is stored until they withdraw it.

Rather than getting lost in its unknowns, instead focus on its underpinning technologies...","post_content":"THE METAVERSE IS a fuzzy concept. It\u2019s generally taken to be a vision for a future internet comprising a network of virtual experiences. But there are differing takes on what this might look like. Most versions of the idea feature certain key technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and virtual worlds \u2013 but do conventional devices such as PCs also have a role to play? Would the virtual worlds be interoperable? Is blockchain core to the idea or just a sideshow? And is this prediction for the future of the web even likely to happen in the first place?\nThe fuzziness is compounded by the word itself. It was coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash, where the metaverse was an alternate, digital reality. When the word was appropriated by Silicon Valley around two years ago, its usage was generally aligned with Stephenson\u2019s idea. But, since then, it has broadened almost to the point of meaninglessness. \nSo, how should business leaders approach this subject? Here\u2019s a suggestion. Rather than getting lost trying to untangle the competing definitions and assess the likelihood of the grand forecasts, it can be helpful to go back to basics. The metaverse might be a nebulous concept, but it encompasses technologies and ideas that are real things in the here and now. Separating out those component parts, assessing them on their own terms and considering whether they may have relevance for the organisation \u2013 regardless of whether 'the metaverse' happens \u2013 can prove fruitful. Here are five key areas to follow\u2026\nVirtual reality\nWhen most people talk about the metaverse, the group of technologies they have in mind typically includes VR. This is an immersive digital experience achieved using a headset with near-eye displays and motion tracking. VR can be used with a variety of media \u2013 innovations such as 360-degree cameras, for instance, allow live action films to be shot for VR \u2013 but in the metaverse context it is most associated with exploring virtual worlds. \nThe earliest such computer-generated environments were the text-based games of the 1970s, such as Colossal Cave Adventure, in which the software describes the surroundings and narrates the action. As computers became more sophisticated, so did the virtual worlds these games could conjure. Text turned to graphics \u2013 initially 2D, later 3D \u2013 and then they shifted online. As this happened, virtual worlds came to be used for purposes other than what might be strictly understood as gaming. Platforms emerged where users could collaboratively create content, for example, and game worlds morphed into social spaces where users might gather in large groups to watch a digital concert as much as fight out a battle royale. This has led to a recent proliferation of virtual realms encompassing everything from brand-built experiences to purpose-built \u2018alternate reality\u2019 platforms. Many are simply accessed over a computer or phone in the conventional manner, but a number of these offer VR support and some commentators expect this to become increasingly commonplace. \u201CThis will be a game changer,\u201D says Sam Hamilton, creative director of Decentraland, a browser-based virtual world. \u201CVirtual worlds work best when people are fully immersed in them, and only then will digital life feel more like a human experience.\u201DSo, what else does the future likely hold for VR? Beyond hardware improvements (see below), two trends stand out. One is the ability to support ever larger numbers of simultaneous users in the same virtual environment. Right now, technical constraints mean hosting more than around 100 users without trade-offs in functionality is a challenge, but improvements in computing power are starting to change that. The other trend is the rise of hardware that can capture data from the physical world \u2013 satellites, 3D scanners \u2013 and feed this into a digital environment. Some speculate this could lead to computer-generated simulations looking increasingly like reality. \nHow is this changing business?\nCommercial activities in virtual worlds typically centre around brand marketing and selling virtual goods. As for VR more broadly, organisations are experimenting in a variety of ways, albeit cautiously. For the entertainment industry, say, VR is a new potential revenue stream \u2013 and not just for gaming. The NBA broadcasts basketball live in VR, allowing users to watch the action as if they were sitting courtside. The remote audience is represented as digital avatars; viewers can move around the \u2018venue\u2019 and interact with each other.\nIt\u2019s not just about consumer applications. Whether it\u2019s meetings, co-working or onboarding, a range of traditional \u2018back end\u2019 business activities are being trialled in VR. Meta Horizon Workrooms, for example, integrates meeting rooms, video calls and presentation tools. Some believe VR experiences improve on the conventional approach. If the creative team at a car company is collaborating on a new design, for example, being able to view it in VR can aid understanding. Or consider training, which can be made safer in a simulation \u2013 if you\u2019re learning to operate a crane, say, the stakes are much higher in real life. VR can also enable new forms of learning. Taking apart a virtual model of the machinery you\u2019re being taught how to fix is arguably more compelling than studying a 2D diagram.\nAugmented reality\nThe idea of bridging the physical and virtual worlds is central to the metaverse conversation, which is why augmented reality is seen as a core technology. But the concept of using screens to overlay digital content on the real world has been around for decades. Consider the \u2018head-up displays\u2019 long used by fighter pilots to view flight data without having to look down at instruments. But it wasn\u2019t until the smartphone hit its stride in the late 2000s that augmented reality came into its own. The combination of portable high-definition screen, web connection, fast processor and integrated camera has enabled a wave of AR apps that turn the phone into a \u2018window\u2019 for mediating the physical world. Many of the use cases are practical: replacing foreign language text with a translation, or previewing how a piece of furniture might look in your home. But AR is also being used for entertainment, allowing users to view geolocated digital artworks, add filters to social video posts, and play games that place characters in the world around them. \nSome futurists predict that AR devices \u2013 mobile phones but also emergent wearables such as AR glasses \u2013 will eventually come to incorporate 3D scanners and powerful graphics chips. These could rapidly map the dimensions of the physical environment relative to the device and overlay reality with a richness and seamlessness that is currently impossible. This is often referred to as \u2018mixed reality\u2019 \u2013 \u2018true AR\u2019 \u2013 where the physical and digital worlds are blurred in a manner that is completely persuasive. Imagine walking down the road wearing AR glasses, for example, and seeing present day London re-skinned as a William Gibson-style cyberpunk city. How broad are the use cases?\nAugmented reality is not just focussed on consumers. Use cases are emerging across a range of domains, from industrial maintenance to military logistics. A particularly promising area is medicine. A number of start-ups offer dedicated AR-based medical devices and some doctors are already using these as a matter of course. Take Dr. Timothy Witham, professor of neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery at Baltimore\u2019s Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Since 2020, he has been using an AR headset made by Chicago-based company Augmedics to assist with inserting spinal instrumentation \u2013 screws and rods \u2013 during spinal surgery. \n\u201CThe spinal cord and nerve roots are literally millimeters next to where you're putting in these screws, which demands very high accuracy and precision,\u201D says Witham. Traditionally, he would rely on X-rays and his understanding of anatomy to insert those items freehand. The view through Augmedics\u2019 headset, however, overlays the spine with the patient\u2019s CT scan imagery \u2013 a little like X-ray vision. \u201CWhen we're going to put a screw in, I can see exactly where it's going with millimetre accuracy,\u201D he says. \u201CThis technology is about 98 percent accurate, which compares favourably to any other method for doing this.\u201D \nWitham believes augmented reality holds significant potential not only for other types of spinal procedure \u2013 he has successfully trialed it for removing spinal tumours \u2013 but also for other areas of medicine. \u201CEventually it will spill over into other disciplines, I'm confident about that,\u201D he says. \u201CI think it will be applicable to removing brain tumours in the future, and I do think it will have applications in other types of surgery such as orthopaedics and abdominal surgery.\u201D\nHardware\nThe range of hardware that falls under the metaverse umbrella is broad. It spans everything from regular smartphones and computers, on the basis that these can be used to access virtual worlds, through to motion-tracking wearables for operating avatars. But the device category that most people have in mind is dedicated headsets for AR and VR. Over the past decade and a half, there has been a renewed interest in developing this hardware among tech companies such as Meta \u2013 and other major players are rumoured to be entering this market in the near future. The ambition is to create affordable, powerful, small headsets that can offer a high-definition experience. Those who believe that \u2018the metaverse\u2019 is the future of the internet foresee this hardware becoming so compelling that it comes to enjoy mass market, smartphone-level adoption globally.\nShould businesses expect this shift any time soon?Headsets are still evolving, and their prices are still high. This, in turn, has stunted the predicted boom in VR and AR adoption. That\u2019s because this hardware represents an almighty technical challenge: it has to operate within many technical constraints yet be more capable than even the most powerful games console. A major issue is miniaturisation: packing a broad range of systems into a small space \u2013 motion trackers, cameras, high-resolution displays \u2013 alongside the required processing power and battery life to render high-quality graphics on the fly. This is not only a computing problem, it\u2019s also a manufacturing problem, because it can\u2019t be solved by combining off-the-shelf components. Much has to be made from scratch. \n\u201CAR eyewear has more challenges than VR,\u201D says Simon Windsor, co-founder of Dimension Studio, which makes volumetric content for major brands. \u201CIf you want to re-skin the world around you \u2013 for virtual content to genuinely and believably coexist in our physical world \u2013 you're reliant on performant eyewear, you're reliant on computer vision, you're reliant on compute, graphics and connectivity. There's lots of technologies, which are required to synchronise to provide a seamless and compelling experience. We don\u2019t have those capabilities in an optimal form yet.\u201D\nAvatars\nAn avatar is a graphical representation of a human that allows them to interact with other users and the virtual world around them. Indeed, more than a billion Meta avatars have now been created. The word itself comes from Hinduism, meaning the \u2018descent\u2019 of a god to Earthly form, but was first used in the contemporary sense in 1985 with the game, Ultima IV: Quest Of The Avatar. Rabindra Ratan, an associate professor who studies avatars at Michigan State University, says that there are three main types, although they do overlap. First, avatars that are simply tools for performing tasks \u2013 you probably think of your car in a driving game as a utilitarian object more than \u2018you\u2019. Secondly, avatars as social others \u2013 when you play as Mario, you likely see him as having a different identity and narrative from your own. Finally, the avatar as \u2018me\u2019 \u2013 you identify with the avatar as a self-representation. \u201CIn most metaverse conversations, we're thinking about this latter usage,\u201D says Ratan. \u201CThough, of course, you might represent yourself differently from who you really are.\u201D \nIndeed, avatar aesthetics range from the anthropomorphic to the fantastical, and can be further adapted with clothes and accessories. New generative AI tools are making it easier to create all kinds of avatars, notably ones that can imitate the user with uncanny photorealism. The reason many virtual world platforms opt for low-fi or cartoonish avatars is to reduce processing requirements, but this constraint may lift as Moore\u2019s Law takes its course.In terms of the future, Ratan is particularly excited about \u201Cthe potential for ownership over a single avatar that could be used across multiple digital contexts\u201D, adding that it could nevertheless adapt its look to specific situations \u2013 more formal for work purposes, say, more expressive for social purposes. \u201CThat would let us feel even more identification with the avatar, and I think the locus of identity for humans will start to shift once we can do this.\u201D People may feel more authentically represented by their avatar than their real self, he says \u2013 especially if augmented reality glasses let others view us re-skinned as an avatar in the real world. \u201CBut that\u2019s an even further future direction.\u201D\nWhy is this relevant to businesses? \nRight now, business applications centre on helping people create avatars and selling digital clothing. For companies exploring digital fashion, the notion of a future where an avatar can represent you consistently across multiple virtual experiences is an exciting one. That\u2019s because it implies a degree of interoperability between virtual experiences. If that becomes possible, then it seems reasonable to think that those digital belongings may be able to move with the avatar. This would give customers a greater reason to buy those items, and also presents brands with a bigger marketing opportunity.\nIn years to come, other kinds of opportunities may arise outside of the bounds of virtual worlds themselves. If AI enables photoreal, \u2018digital twin\u2019 avatars become widespread, for instance, fashion retailers could use these to let customers preview e-commerce purchases of physical items.\nNFTs\nA non-fungible token (NFT) is a record on a blockchain that certifies ownership of a digital asset, such as an artwork. The idea took off in the developer community in the mid-2010s, and gained wider popularity in 2017 through online games based around trading NFTs. Since then, independent creators and major businesses alike have sold everything from digital wearables to music as NFTs \u2013 and the marketplace has been on a rollercoaster. At its peak in 2021, NFT artworks were being auctioned for tens of millions of dollars. But as crypto markets tanked over the course of 2022, so did the market for NFTs.\nNevertheless, NFTs still feature prominently in metaverse discourse because a virtual economy relies on being able to prove ownership of digital files, and also because an NFT establishes scarcity and, therefore, value. If there are only 10 NFTs for an artwork, it constrains perceived supply of an infinitely copyable asset.How are brands using NFTs?\nNFTs have been used as rewards in games, membership cards and loyalty program points. Generally, however, brands are gravitating towards two main applications: virtual art and virtual clothing. Virtual fashion platform RTFKT, for instance, made headlines two years ago when it sold 620 pairs of digital trainers for $3.1 million in seven minutes. It has since been acquired by Nike. \nWhat do people get wrong about NFTs?\nNFTs are freighted with misapprehensions. Although the term is often used to refer to the virtual objects over which you have ownership, an NFT is technically just a digital record on a blockchain. That record is associated with your unique crypto wallet ID and includes a link to the digital file in question, which is hosted externally. This establishes provenance, sure, but let\u2019s be clear: that file is not itself \u2018stored on the blockchain\u2019. The digital assets themselves are thus more vulnerable than many believe. It\u2019s also a common misconception that these files can be ported with ease between different digital platforms.\nWhy are people buying NFTs?\nClearly, much of the market is driven by speculation. But Benoit Pagotto, founder of RTFKT, says that\u2019s not the whole story. \u201CFor sure, a lot of people are doing it initially for investment, but then they realise they have become part of a community. I think that\u2019s what makes people stay in the end. They have a sense of belonging to something greater than themselves, which is I believe a cultural revolution powered by blockchain technology in the background. And the thing with blockchain is it\u2019s transparent \u2013 you can see what everyone is buying \u2013 so you can tell who is here to speculate and make money and who's here to collect and stay for the long run.\u201D \nBut aren\u2019t NFTs just a mechanism to create artificial scarcity? \u201CThere are lots of brands that could make a lot more output than they do \u2013 that controlled scarcity is just part of how you build your brand and your product. That\u2019s true in the watch industry, the car industry, the diamond industry,\u201D he says. \u201CBut on the digital side, we never had that option until now.\u201D\nWhat\u2019s happening at the cutting edge?\nThere\u2019s an increasing interest in using NFTs to merge the physical and digital worlds. RTFKT sells physical trainers that contain NFC (near-field communication) chips. \u201CWe call them \u2018World Merging chips\u2019,\u201D says Pagotto. The user scans the chip with their phone to acquire an NFT version of the shoes. \u201CThis helps authenticate the item. Counterfeiting is a big problem in the luxury industry. And these chips are opening a lot more possibilities of the future where, for example, we could do physical events where you can only enter if you have the physical sneakers with the chip inside.\u201D\nThe future\nTechnology does not develop deterministically. No matter how much innovators attempt to will a technology into existence, it\u2019s up to the market to decide if it wants it. What\u2019s more, the evolution of technology is recursive rather than linear: new tools give rise to new behaviours which give rise to new use cases and therefore new technologies. These two factors make future gazing a precarious exercise. \nSome anticipate that the notion of the metaverse \u2013 if we still use that term in years to come \u2013 will eventually incorporate frontier technologies such as volumetric video screens (which show 3D images without the need for special glasses) and brain-computer interfaces (which let users operate computers via thought alone). This is clearly highly speculative. But so too are many of the forecasts we\u2019ve been discussing. \nSo, where does this leave organisations who need to strategically plan for the future? Here are a few guiding principles. For one, keep time horizons short \u2013 trying to forecast beyond two or three years is practically impossible. For another, unless you need to be at the bleeding edge, look at what others are doing in the here and now, track those that innovate early, and learn from the mistakes of the early adopters. Finally, remember: the future belongs to those who not only can best weed out the signals from the noise, but who are most able to adapt when that future arrives \u2013 whatever form it may take. After all, the only certainty is change.\nLearn more about marketing in the metaverse on meta.com.\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65e9c273e0038c22b89c197c\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/MetaHeader_final_v001.png","author":null,"title":"How to Think About \u2018the Metaverse\u2019","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/how-to-think-about-the-metaverse\/","tags":["","BRAND LAB","PROMOTION"]},{"date":"05.02.2023","summary":"The collapse of the exchange has pushed users back to \u201Cself-custody\u201D products like Ledger.

He was recently released on bail from a prison in Montenegro, where he was arrested last year and awaits extradition.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nExpert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty - Blockchain\nIn Kwon\u2019s absence, the jury in the US civil trial in the Southern District of New York heard evidence from investors who bought into Terraform tokens, whistleblowers from companies with which Terraform partnered, and other witnesses. After a deliberation lasting less than two hours, the jury found Kwon and Terraform liable on civil fraud charges related to making false claims and misleading investors in Terraform\u2019s cryptotoken.\n\u201CWe are pleased with today\u2019s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud,\u201D said SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal in a statement. \u201CFor all of crypto\u2019s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people.\u201D\nThe resolution of Kwon\u2019s civil trial\u2014along with the recent sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of fallen crypto exchange FTX\u2014will help to draw a line under a traumatic period for the crypto industry, says market analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis Trading. \u201CMany feel hurt by what Do Kwon did. Those that invested feel betrayed,\u201D she says. \u201CHopefully, people will be reminded to do more homework and ask better questions, to avoid getting drawn into rather flimsy claims again.\u201D\nKwon started Terraform in 2018, alongside cofounder Daniel Shin. By 2020, the company announced plans to launch a stablecoin called TerraUSD (UST), whose value would remain pegged to the US dollar, ostensibly providing holders with a refuge from the volatility of other crypto assets.\nStablecoins are typically held to a specific value by an underlying basket of assets\u2014including cash and short-term government bonds\u2014for which they can be redeemed at any time. But UST, claimed Terraform, would be pegged to its dollar value by way of a complex algorithm, tying it to a second coin issued by the firm known as LUNA. If the value of UST were ever to diverge from $1, traders would theoretically be incentivized to either buy or sell the stablecoin until the target value was restored.\nAt the height of its popularity, in early 2022, LUNA was among the 10 largest cryptocurrencies in the world by the combined value of coins in circulation\u2014and UST wasn\u2019t far behind. \u201CIt was an intriguing and very novel mechanism,\u201D says Acheson. \u201CMany smart people believed it would work.\u201DIn May 2022, it all went wrong. When holders of large amounts of UST sold the token in bulk, it slipped from its dollar peg, leading to panic and a broader sell-off that drove the price practically to zero. LUNA and Terraform\u2019s other coins were decimated along with it. \u201CThe mechanism was based on the faulty assumption that people would want it to self-correct and therefore it would,\u201D says Acheson. \u201C[Kwon] made marketing claims about the stability of stablecoins that weren\u2019t true.\u201D\nThe incident sent crypto markets into a downward spiral and catalyzed a chain reaction that brought a string of crypto companies to their knees. The failure of Terraform\u2019s tokens contributed to the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in June, followed by crypto lenders Voyager Digital, then BlockFi, then Genesis\u2014and, in a roundabout way, FTX too.\nAfter the incident, Kwon fled Singapore, where Terraform was headquartered, for Dubai and then Serbia. He was later apprehended by authorities in Montenegro, where he was sentenced to four months in prison for attempting to leave the country on a fake Costa Rican passport. The kind of \u201Chubris\u201D displayed by Kwon, says Acheson, \u201Chas been part of the crypto ecosystem for some time.\u201D\nThe SEC\u2019s case was built around two core allegations: First, that Kwon and Terraform had misled investors about the capacity for UST to restore itself to a dollar valuation\u2014to self-heal\u2014without intervention; and second, that they had lied about Chai, a large Korean payments firm founded by Shin, utilizing Terraform technology to conduct its operations, leaving investors with an unmerited confidence in the prospect of widespread adoption.\nIn May 2021, after UST had fallen from its peg for the first time, the SEC alleged, Kwon struck a secret deal with trading firm Jump Trading, which agreed to purchase the token in large volumes until its value was restored to the target level. At trial, a whistleblower who had worked as a software developer at Jump Trading testified to that effect. (During the SEC investigation, the president of Jump\u2019s crypto trading division declined to comment in a deposition, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Jump has not been charged by the SEC.)\nAlmost as soon as Jump intervened to manually restore UST to its dollar valuation, the SEC claimed, Kwon and Terraform began to make misleading public statements, telling people the token \u201Cautomatically self-heals\u201D by design.\nA second SEC whistleblower, a former Chai executive, testified that the payments company did not process or settle transactions using Terraform technology, as Kwon had claimed. Instead, the SEC alleged, Terraform had artificially mirrored Chai transactions on its network to create the impression of legitimate traffic. It presented to the court messages between the two Terraform cofounders in which Kwon suggested they create \u201Cfake transactions that look real,\u201D and promised to \u201Ctry my best to make it indiscernible.\u201D\nBoth strands of the SEC\u2019s case were \u201Cextremely strong,\u201D says Daniel Silva, a former US prosecutor and attorney at law firm Buchalter. \u201CIt\u2019s easy when you have people lying. \u2018Fraud\u2019 is a fancy word, but really it\u2019s just lying to gain property.

As it amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally, it openly told the United States government that, as an offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.\nThen, late last month, those years of brushing off US regulators caught up with the company in the form of one the most punitive money-laundering criminal settlements in the history of the US Justice Department. The crackdown doesn't just mean a chastened Binance will have to change its practices going forward. It means that when the company is sentenced in a matter of months, it will be forced to open its past books to regulators, too. What was once a haven for anarchic crypto commerce is about to be transformed into the opposite: perhaps the most fed-friendly business in the cryptocurrency industry, retroactively offering more than a half-decade of users' transaction records to US regulators and law enforcement.\nWhen the Department of Justice announced on November 21 that Binance's executives had agreed to plead guilty to criminal money-laundering charges, much of the attention on that settlement focused on founder Changpeng Zhao giving up his CEO role and on the company's record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. But Binance's settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US Treasury Department also stipulate a strict new regime of data-sharing with law enforcement and regulators. The company has agreed to comply with regulators' \"requests for information\"\u2014a term that carries none of the evidence or suspicion requirements necessary for obtaining a warrant or even a subpoena\u2014to the point of producing any \"information, testimony, document, record, or other tangible evidence.\"\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nBinance has also agreed to scour all of its transactions from 2018 to 2022 and file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for anything it deems a potential violation of US law from that five-year period. That \u201CSAR lookback\u201D means the company will now be actively scrutinizing its customers in retrospect, not just passively assenting to regulators poring over its databases. Those SARs are collected by FinCEN, the Treasury Department's financial crimes division, but then made available to law enforcement agencies from the FBI to IRS Criminal Investigations to local police. And all of this new scrutiny will be overseen by a \"monitor\" firm chosen by the US government but paid by Binance\u2014an in-house watchdog assigned to make sure Binance is complying in good faith.\n\"I don't think Binance's customers have the slightest clue of the ramifications of this plea and consent decree. It's unprecedented,\" says John Reed Stark, who spent 20 years as an attorney at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including as the founder of its Office of Internet Enforcement. \u201CIf they're a drug dealer or a terrorist or a child pornography peddler, they're going to get caught.\" He describes Binance's agreement as a \"24\/7, 365-days-a-year financial colonoscopy.\"\nOne US prosecutor, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to media about the case, calls the degree of access to Binance's records described in the agreement \"kind of crazy,\" and remains in disbelief at the idea of Binance abiding by the settlement. \"I don't know what kind of business would want to operate while allowing that much government oversight, especially one that's deliberately stayed out of the US so that they're not under our nose,\" they say. \"The other option must have been really bad.\"If Binance does comply, however, the prosecutor adds that \"it would be a game changer in taking down transnational syndicates doing evil deeds worldwide and trying to shield those crimes by using cryptocurrency to move money.\"\nBinance's chief compliance officer, Noah Perlman, tells WIRED that Binance has collected \"know-your-customer\" information on users and cooperated with US law enforcement on data requests for the past two years. He added that all reports to the monitor firm inside Binance would be \"confidential\"\u2014as in, not shared publicly, only with the US government\u2014and that it would continue to abide by data privacy laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.\nBut Perlman also says he's \"excited\" for the new era the agreements represent for Binance. \"I feel like this is a great opportunity for Binance to set the standard for what compliance in this industry should look like,\" he says. \"For the general community, removing concerns of illicit finance in crypto is one of the most important things we can do to drive mainstream adoption. Hopefully, the vast majority of users will feel that there's assurance here, that the funds are safer than ever, and they have nothing to worry about as long as they're not part of the very small, small group of users that use crypto for illicit purposes.\"\nWhile Binance's new radical transparency may be welcomed by law enforcement and regulators, its users and advocates of financial privacy may not be so pleased. Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein calls the settlement an \"overreach\" that he believes is part of a US regulatory effort to set a precedent for crypto as a whole. \u201CThey\u2019re going to try to force people to use these regulated platforms where everything is monitorable,\" Gladstein says. He adds that Binance is \"an unsavory corporation, but still, it's alarming what the US government is doing.\"\nDigital civil liberties nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation, too, has historically called on cryptocurrency exchanges to stop giving up users' transaction data to law enforcement and regulators without notifying those users. Now, the Binance settlement would create perhaps the most extreme case yet of that crypto exchange data-sharing, giving the US government wholesale access to the records of a crypto hub that at some points processed billions of transactions a day.\n\"EFF is increasingly worried about law enforcement turning to intermediaries such as cryptocurrency exchanges and hosted wallet providers to obtain sensitive user data,\" the EFF's cryptocurrency-focused attorney, Marta Belcher, wrote in a 2020 blog post. \"The fact that the transactions are made through cryptocurrency rather than through traditional financial channels indicates that the transactions are more likely to be sensitive, and that the person making the transaction may be turning to cryptocurrency precisely because of the privacy protection it provides.\" That argument may apply particularly to Binance, given its early reputation as an offshore exchange that didn't bow to US government data demands.\nIn fact, some Binance users may not have considered the risk of their data becoming available to crypto investigators in the new settlement, in part because Binance has at some points collected far less data on its users than other exchanges. Part of Binance's appeal to users has been that, for years, it asked only for a user's email address to set up an account\u2014one of its many now-admitted violations of US know-your-customer requirements that led to last month's crackdown.But US law enforcement has proven that even troves of exchange data that lack users' names can nonetheless be highly revealing of their financial history\u2014especially in combination with blockchain data and information from other exchanges that usually do comply with know-your-customer laws. In the case of the Welcome to Video child sexual abuse materials dark-web site in 2017, for instance, one alleged abuser was identified and arrested after his email address was tied to an account on the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e, which authorities had seized months earlier.\nIn another case, BTC-e's data allowed IRS criminal investigators to identify a hacker who had taken nearly 70,000 bitcoins from the Silk Road dark-web drug market\u2014worth more than $3 billion today\u2014and then track them down and seize the funds. Though BTC-e didn't collect users' names or other identifying details, its data still served as the missing link in both those cases\u2014just as Binance's no doubt will in many more investigations to come.\nAssenting to have US regulators comb through its data, for a company that spent years resisting regulation, may be a severe culture shock, says Stark, the former SEC attorney. He says he won't be surprised if the company ends up violating the terms of the agreement. \"It's like taking someone who's been a drug addict for a decade and drug-testing them every day and thinking that they're not going to try to sneak something in,\" he says.\nUltimately, with enormous fines and criminal sentences hanging over the heads of its executives\u2014and worse punishments if its settlement falls through\u2014Binance may not have a choice about baring its soul to the US government. Neither, whether they know it or not, will its users.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/655e55765a9f03a94854e2cd\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/binance.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"The Binance Crackdown Will Be an 'Unprecedented' Bonanza for Crypto Surveillance","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/binance-settlement-transaction-histories\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","PRIVACY","CRIME","POLICE","REGULATION"]},{"date":"05.25.2023","summary":"A security review describes how attackers exploited mistakes to steal millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.","post_content":"WHEN A HACKER, or hackers, broke into the Bitfinex crypto exchange and stole 119,754 bitcoins in 2016, their haul was worth $72 million.

But, as in past crises, figuring out the right way to get aid to people has been a huge challenge. For people who have been displaced, the best support is cash. Unlike in-kind assistance like food or clothing, cash can be used for anything, and it\u2019s flexible for when circumstances change. \u201CWe always ask ourselves: Why not cash?\u201D says Carmen Hett, treasurer for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency.\nIn Defense of the Future\nThis story is part of WIRED30, our special 30th anniversary series. Read more here.\nThe humanitarian sector has historically been reluctant to distribute cash to refugees over fears\u2014since debunked by multiple studies\u2014that the money would be squandered on so-called temptation goods, like alcohol or tobacco. But cash has played a bigger role than ever in the Ukraine crisis. Nearly half of all of the aid delivered by the Disasters Emergency Committee, a coalition of UK-based charities, in the first six months of the war was in cash.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nHowever, cash is difficult to move around. It either has to be shipped physically by the pallet-load into war zones and disaster areas, creating logistical and security headaches, or delivered electronically via the traditional banking system, the rigidity of which can pose problems for people whose documentation has been lost.\nRecognizing these limitations, the UNHCR has moved to deploy an alternative system, partnering with the Stellar Development Foundation, a nonprofit that supports the growth of the Stellar blockchain network. The two organizations are working alongside money transfer company MoneyGram and Circle Internet Financial, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, to rig up a system for sending aid directly to Ukrainian refugees using crypto. Cryptocurrencies have often been dismissed as being useful only for financial speculation, but in Ukraine the technology may be a solution to a real-world problem.\n\u201CThis project is a prototype but a very real one,\u201D says Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at Circle. \u201CIf you can solve the gaps in money logistics in such an acute conflict, it stands to reason that these types of innovations would be meaningful\u201D in other contexts too.The system works like this: The UNHCR delivers USDC, a crypto coin locked to a $1 valuation and hosted on the Stellar network, to a digital wallet that can be accessed via smartphone. The recipient then exchanges their coins for local currency at any MoneyGram facility.\nThe UNHCR is also using standard bank transfers to distribute aid. However, as Hett says, although the Ukrainian banking system has so far proven resilient, if a bank were to fail, its customers would be left without access to the aid in their accounts. But a stablecoin is hosted on decentralized infrastructure and in the custody of individual wallet owners, which means funds cannot be withheld. Digital wallets are also available to people who don\u2019t have a bank account.\nThe Ukrainian government has put in place strict capital controls to prevent money from flowing out of the local economy, meaning that refugees who have left the country face restricted access to funds in their bank accounts. But stablecoins are geography-agnostic; the only restriction in this context is the proximity of a MoneyGram location, of which there are 4,500 in Ukraine and roughly 350,000 worldwide.\nCrypto has been tapped to collect donations during humanitarian crises in the past. It has been successful in bringing together pools of money, but it can be difficult to actually use on the ground. In Turkey and Syria, after a huge earthquake in February that killed more than 50,000 people, recipients of crypto donations complained that they couldn\u2019t spend the coins or turn them into fiat currency, limiting their usefulness. \n\u201CThe challenge is that there\u2019s not a lot someone can do with crypto once they have it in their possession,\u201D says Alex Holmes, MoneyGram\u2019s CEO. \u201CIt\u2019s not a form of payment that a lot of [vendors] accept.\u201D \nThe UNHCR pilot overcomes this problem by building in a mechanism to convert crypto into cash. \nFor now, the stablecoin program in Ukraine is being piloted on a microscopic scale, with fewer than 100 participants in the cities of Kyiv, Lviv, and Vinnytsia. The UNHCR is preparing to expand the initiative to up to 5,000 wallets by April, but this would still represent only a fraction of the number of Ukrainians displaced by the war.\nHett declined to reveal how much cash has already been distributed via the program\u2014information she describes as \u201Cnot so important\u201D\u2014but insists the system is ready to scale. \u201CIt\u2019s not about how many millions have flowed through,\u201D she claims, \u201Cit\u2019s about how many millions will flow through going forward.\u201D\nUkraine may be an ideal proving ground for experimental financial services of this kind. Even before the war, the country was nurturing plans under President Volodymir Zelensky to become a digital-first economy and build a central bank digital currency\u2014a blockchain-based version of Ukraine\u2019s hryvnia.\n\u201CYou\u2019ve got a community that is used to change, with high consumer technology penetration, and generations of people scattered across the globe,\u201D says Dora Chomiak, board member at the Ukraine-focused nonprofit Razom. \u201CCombine all of those things, and going beyond formal banking makes sense.\u201DThe process of launching the project has, in its own way, been radical for a humanitarian system known for its often ponderous bureaucracy.\nThe project was incubated for 10 months before being launched in December, far quicker than its backers anticipated, according to Denelle Dixon, CEO at the Stellar Development Foundation. As well as the usual red tape, the job of convincing stakeholders of the technology was made harder by the implosion of crypto exchange FTX in November, which sparked a crisis of confidence in the sector. \u201CBut I think that\u2019s mostly behind us now,\u201D says Dixon.\nThe goal is not to replace traditional cash-based intervention, say the UNHCR and its partners, but to arm humanitarian organizations with alternative rails for distributing aid that support the full range of scenarios refugees may find themselves in. \u201CThe real breakthroughs here are more evolutionary than revolutionary,\u201D says Disparte. \u201CIt\u2019s about extending the brick-and-mortar banking system beyond its many limitations.\u201D\nIt is also important to avoid scenarios in which crypto is applied to problems that do not exist, says Dixon. \u201CYou never want crypto to be a square peg in a round hole. This is just another option\u2014another tool in the toolbox.\u201D\nIrrespective of the small scope of the initial pilot, the partners on the UNHCR scheme believe that projects like their own, as well as the $78 million in crypto donated to Ukrainian causes since the war began, hint at a permanent change in the way humanitarian aid will be distributed.\nThe UNHCR is investigating the potential for the same system to assist those displaced by the economic crises in Venezuela and Argentina, says Hett. And Holmes points to potential applications in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201CHaving portable access to money, no matter where they are, gives people the options to move on in life,\u201D says Hett. \u201CThe question is now, how can we do more of this? Because we know it works.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/64110f9bd531bd05a681abb9\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/w30_MARCH_DEMOCRACY_UKRAINE-CRYPTO.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"In Ukraine, Crypto Finds a Purpose","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ukraine-crypto-refugee-aid\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","UKRAINE","RUSSIA","WIRED30"]},{"date":"12.11.2023","summary":"The responsible AI, sustainable tech, and cleantech scenes are all thriving in Amsterdam, a city favored for its location, cost of living, and culture.","post_content":"IT\u2019S EASY TO see why global investment platform fDi Intelligence ranked Amsterdam a heavyweight for direct investment, maintaining its number two spot among major European cities.

His crypto-mining company, among the largest in the world, has found itself\u2014like the rest of the industry\u2014in the path of a perfect storm.\nOver the past year, the sector has been battered by a slump in the price of bitcoin, combined with a spike in the cost of energy and an increase in mining difficulty\u2014a reflection of the amount of computing power directed at the bitcoin network, which dictates the proportion of coins miners are able to win. \nAt the height of the 2021 boom, profit margins in the mining business rose as high as 90 percent, says Thiel. But now, they have \u201Ctotally collapsed.\u201D If the price of bitcoin does not rally, he says, there will be \u201Ca lot more pain,\u201D and firms that are only marginally profitable today will find themselves \u201Cvery underwater.\u201D \nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nAs they scramble to cut costs, miners are playing a high-stakes game of chicken. In spring 2024, the halving, a mechanism baked into the bitcoin system that periodically cuts the number of coins awarded in half, will slash mining profits. The goal for miners is to ensure they are in a strong enough financial position to survive the fall in profits longer than anyone else; as miners give in and drop from the network, the share of coins won by the rest will increase. \n\u201CAny miners that are struggling now will not be able to survive the halving,\u201D says Jeff Burkey, VP of business development at Foundry, which operates its own mining facilities, a large-scale mining pool, and a marketplace for mining hardware. The dynamic will create a rush among miners to get their houses in order, he explains.\nMiners will look to eke out additional profit margin wherever they can, whether by deploying superior hardware and cooling techniques, developing software to closely monitor the performance of machines, relocating to territories with cheaper power, or renegotiating the terms of their loans.\nOthers, like Geosyn Mining, are aiming at vertical integration\u2014all the way down to the energy powering the facilities. The company, says CEO Caleb Ward, wants to construct its own solar farm to power its machines, thereby eliminating a major cost. \u201CWe need to be more thoughtful as an industry about how we protect against risk,\u201D he says. \u201CIt\u2019s not all about shooting for the moon.\u201D\nMeanwhile, the miners whose financial predicaments prevent them from fine-tuning their operations are playing a dangerous waiting game, gambling on an increase in the price of bitcoin that may never come.\n\u201CThe beauty of halving cycles is that the industry [is forced] to become more efficient\u2014a lot of weaker players will have to exit the business,\u201D says Jeff Lucas, CFO of mining company Bitfarms, which has worked to restructure its finances in the downturn. \u201CThe devil is in the details.\u201D\nAlready on the back foot, mining companies are beginning to fold. Compute North, which owned multiple large-scale mining facilities, filed for bankruptcy in September, and Core Scientific, a publicly traded miner, did the same in December. Others are having to maneuver. Argo Blockchain, also a public company, was forced to sell off mining equipment and its state-of-the-art mining center, while Stronghold Digital Mining has negotiated a debt repayment holiday. Neither company responded to interview requests.A combination of \u201Cimmaturity, poor planning, and greed\u201D has led miners to the brink of collapse, says Phil Harvey, CEO of Sabre56, a crypto-mining consultancy firm that also operates its own facilities. While the market was hot, companies took on large amounts of debt at high interest rates (10-20 percent) to finance expansion, says Harvey, and now the value of the coins they earn is insufficient to cover the costs of repayments.\nHistorically, a steep rise in the price of bitcoin, triggered by a buying frenzy, has been followed by a sharp fall and then a gradual recovery. Although there is no guarantee this pattern will repeat, the process is widely described as the bitcoin cycle. The fatal mistake, says Jaime Leverton, CEO of mining company Hut 8, was to imagine that that 2021 was different\u2014that the industry was in a \u201Csupercycle\u201D that was going to \u201Cbreak prior cycles\u201D and extend the hot streak. A lot of people bought into this idea, she explains, and so were caught off-guard when the market tanked.\nIn an effort to strengthen its own position, Hut 8 is in the process of merging with US Bitcoin, another mining firm. The goal, says Leverton, is to minimize risks associated with the volatility of bitcoin by diversifying both revenue streams and the regions in which the business operates.\nWhereas Hut 8 only has facilities in Canada and mines exclusively for itself, US Bitcoin runs mines across the US and hosts mining hardware for third-party customers alongside other auxiliary services. \u201CIt\u2019s important to be dynamic,\u201D says Mike Ho, cofounder of US Bitcoin. \u201CThere is an optimal strategy, depending on the price of bitcoin. It\u2019s about knowing how to navigate through the cycle at different stages.\u201D\nRecognizing the trajectory of the market, other companies have sought to eliminate outstanding debt as rapidly as possible. In the summer of 2021, Bitfarms had $165 million of debt on its books, at interest rates between 16 and 18 percent. Lucas says it may seem \u201Cabsurd\u201D to stomach these exorbitant rates, but it \u201Cmade sense\u201D because the cost of debt was eclipsed by the revenue generated by mining activity\u2014at least until it wasn\u2019t. \n\u201CAs revenues came down dramatically with the price of bitcoin, there was still a high debt to pay for,\u201D he says. \u201CAnd that put a squeeze on a lot of companies.\u201D \nIn June 2022, Bitfarms began to sell down the bitcoin in its treasury to eliminate its debt. Earlier this month, the firm also managed to negotiate down a $21 million debt to bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi that was instead paid off in a single $7.75 million cash payment. The company\u2019s approach to slashing debt, coupled with a focus on maximizing the efficiency of its mining rigs, says Lucas, will put Bitfarms in good stead to weather the remainder of the crypto winter.\nThe scramble among miners to balance the books has attracted the attention of other market participants hoping to increase their market share at a reduced price. Investment firm Galaxy Digital has long been eager to expand its bitcoin-mining operations. Sensing an opportunity, the company swooped in to grab Argo\u2019s flagship Helios mine in December, spending $65 million for a facility reported to have cost at least $1.5 billion to build.\nMergers, acquisitions, and collapses will continue to be a theme, says Alex Mologoko, analyst at blockchain intelligence company Elementus, until \u201Call economically unsustainable mining operations are weeded out.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63eede2c5b4882ebafffb0e1\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Biz-data-mining-934468788.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Bitcoin Miners Are Playing a High-Stakes Game of Chicken","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/bitcoin-mining-halving-crypto-winter\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","MARKETS","BLOCKCHAIN"]},{"date":"02.13.2023","summary":"The Securities and Exchange Commission launched enforcement actions against some of the industry\u2019s major players, raising questions over crypto\u2019s future.","post_content":"THE US SECURITIES and Exchange Commission is on the warpath\u2014and crypto is in its crosshairs. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that the agency intends to sue crypto firm Paxos for issuing BUSD, a stablecoin developed in partnership with the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance. \nThe SEC declined to comment, but Paxos, which is based in New York and Singapore, confirmed today that the agency alleges BUSD should have been registered as a security in the US, which requires compliance with complex rules. In a statement, the firm said it \u201Ccategorically disagrees\u201D that BUSD is a security but has complied with an order from the New York Department of Financial Services to halt the creation of any new BUSD, effectively strangling the coin.\nPaxos did not respond to a request for comment. Binance\u2019s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann, declined to comment on how the SEC\u2019s action would affect the exchange but said the firm will be \u201Creviewing other projects to ensure users are insulated from further undue harm.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nThe crypto industry is no stranger to conflict with regulators, but the Paxos case is different\u2014and it has sparked a measure of panic and confusion. The concern is that a ruling against the issuing or use of BUSD will set a precedent that could be applied to all stablecoins, striking down a crucial piece of infrastructure in many crypto markets. \u201CIf the supply suddenly dried up, the crypto economy would collapse,\u201D says economist Frances Coppola, who previously worked for HSBC and other banks.\nDesigned to cling to a specific value, usually $1, stablecoins are a critical pillar of the crypto economy. Most are backed by a combination of cash and bonds, which anchors the tokens in circulation to the desired value.\nUnlike cash, which can be difficult to move around, especially across borders, stablecoins are \u201Ceasy and fast,\u201D says crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of CoinDesk, helping traders jump on opportunities as they arise. They have \u201Copened up an economy on-chain,\u201D says Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of wealth management firm Lumida, allowing money to \u201Cflow into and stay in the ecosystem.\u201D\nThe SEC defines securities as contracts that amount to \u201Can investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit, to be derived from the efforts of others.\u201D The classification brings with it a range of regulatory and disclosure requirements. If stablecoins were universally determined to be securities, issuers would be required to register them with the SEC, giving the agency a chance to reject coins. Any stablecoins already on the market could be subject to enforcement action.\nBemused members of the crypto industry, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, are now asking how stablecoins can possibly meet the SEC\u2019s criteria, and in particular how crypto coins designed not to fluctuate in value can be said to be sold with a reasonable expectation of profit.\nBut action against a major stablecoin issuer should be no surprise, says Acheson, because the SEC has said on multiple occasions that it believes some stablecoins qualify as securities. Acheson imagines the regulator will argue that stablecoins like BUSD, backed by their issuer\u2019s holdings of established securities such as government and corporate bonds, are by extension securities themselves and must be regulated accordingly.Because neither the SEC nor Paxos have specified the nature of the regulator\u2019s complaint, says Ahluwalia, the impact of a potential lawsuit is unclear for now. But it can hardly be good for stablecoin issuers\u2014and could signal more trouble to come.\nThe move against Paxos is the latest in a volley of enforcement actions launched by the SEC in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November. Last week, the regulator announced that crypto exchange Kraken would halt one of its services in the US, after the SEC charged the firm with failing to register a security. And in January, the agency charged crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital over different services offered to US customers. \nThis crackdown is being described in crypto circles as Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2014a reference to a program launched by the Obama administration, under which US officials were alleged to have pressured banks into severing ties with disfavored industries like pornography and payday lending. \nCoppola says it feels like the SEC\u2019s intention is to \u201Cdrive crypto entirely offshore,\u201D and out of the US altogether. \u201CThe SEC wants to prevent US citizens from interacting with crypto. And I think other countries may follow suit.\u201D\nDespite fears the SEC will target stablecoins more broadly, Acheson, Coppola, and Ahluwalia all suspect the agency is taking on Paxos as a way to gain a measure of control over Binance, and that it does not reflect an enmity towards stablecoins in general. Although Binance is by far the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, it operates only a limited service in the US. But Reuters reports that the US has long believed Binance to have facilitated money laundering activity.\nBy taking aim at BUSD, the stablecoin that underpins much of Binance\u2019s activity, says Coppola, the SEC can effectively shut the firm off from a source of US dollars. Ahluwalia agrees, suggesting the SEC is looking for creative ways to \u201Cdefang\u201D Binance. \u201CIf you\u2019re a regulator that has suspicions but not jurisdiction, you pull the levers at your disposal,\u201D he says. Binance has always maintained that it plays a central role in helping law enforcement deal with financial crime.\nUntil the SEC makes its intentions known, though, the crypto industry must wait. \u201CWe\u2019re all just guessing,\u201D says Ahluwalia. If the SEC were to go after other stablecoin issuers, like Circle or Tether, the consequences would be severe. Without stablecoins acting as a \u201Cbridge\u201D between volatile coins, trading would become more expensive and riskier, says Coppola\u2014and the decentralized finance sector as a whole could topple. \u201CPotentially,\u201D she says, \u201Cthis could bring down the entire crypto edifice.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63ead20bde59d567d5d7c701\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/confusion_GettyImages-1443335545.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Confusion Spirals in Crypto as the US Cracks Down","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/confusion-spirals-in-crypto-as-the-us-cracks-down\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","REGULATION","FINANCE"]},{"date":"03.06.2024","summary":"The energy demands of bitcoin mining have sparked controversy in a state that once welcomed those companies with open arms.","post_content":"Three years ago, bitcoin miners flocked to the state of Texas.

Alistair is the author of three books on technology and business, including the best-selling Lean Analytics, and is currently working on Just Evil Enough, a playbook for subversive thinking.\nFortunately, we have a solution waiting in plain sight. But to understand the elegance of this relatively simple hack, let\u2019s first look at the alternatives and why they won\u2019t work.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nEnglish Teacher Grades Homework By ChatGPT\nBoth legislators and tech firms agree that the best way to distinguish AI-generated content from content made by humans is to mark it at the point of origin, something seven tech firms pledged to do as part of an agreement the White House announced last week. There are three broad approaches to watermarking digital content. The first is to add metadata, which cameras have been doing for decades. Blocks of text are often marked up as well. When you type something in bold, or set a font\u2019s color on a website, the word processor or browser labels your content with metadata. But it\u2019s application-specific: Paste some bold text into your address bar, and the formatting is gone.\nYou can also watermark digital images using steganography, which hides one message inside another cryptographically. First used by spies to smuggle secrets, there are now plenty of design tools that add hidden markings to images, then crawl the web looking for copyright violators. And encryption works for watermarking too. You can digitally sign a paragraph of text, and then tell when it\u2019s been altered, either through a centralized system (a digital certificate authority) or a distributed one (a blockchain). This is why that movie you bought only plays in iTunes, and that NFT you\u2019ve forgotten about still belongs to you.\nBut these approaches have three fundamental problems. First, they require immense coordination. By contrast, a good AI markup solution would need to work seamlessly across billions of devices. The markings would have to survive being copied and pasted from one app, operating system, or platform to another. Second, any solution would have to be accessible to any human with an internet connection, without any training, immediately. It would need to be deployable to the whole world with just a software update.\nThird, while watermarks work well enough for large objects like images, songs, or book chapters, they don\u2019t work for smaller objects like individual words or letters. That means these approaches don\u2019t handle content that blends human and machine well. If you have a document that\u2019s generated by an AI, and then edited by a human, you need a more fine-grained watermark\u2014the digital equivalent of a highlighter.\nThat may seem like an impossibly tall order. But in fact, this system already exists: Unicode.\nUnicode is the universal numbering system for text, and text is the fundamental building block of the internet. In Unicode, every character has a number. The Latin Capital Letter A, for example, is hexadecimal number 41. But there are plenty of other A\u2019s in Unicode: There\u2019s Fullwidth Latin Capital Letter A (Ａ, number EF BC A1), Mathematical Bold Capital A (𝐀, number F0 9D 90 80), Mathematical Sans-Serif Capital A (𝖠, F0 9D 96 A0), and plenty of others. Each A has its own name, its own Unicode value, and in some cases, its own font shape. Why not create a letter A just for AI?Unlike metadata, which is attached to content, the unicode value is the content. If the companies who pledged to watermark AI content at the point of origin do so using Unicode\u2014essentially giving AI its own character set\u2014we\u2019ll have a ready-made, fine-grained AI watermark that works across all devices, platforms, operating systems, and websites.\nIt\u2019s important to note that this proposed markup is not an enforcement mechanism. Bad actors could easily convert AI text to look like it was written by a human. A recipient still needs to trust a sender in order to believe what is marked up. But that\u2019s one of the strengths of this approach. Once text is marked, a human has to actively remove the AI marker at some stage between the LLM and the consumer. We have legal mechanisms to investigate and deal with negligence or wrongdoing. The proposed protocol simply lets us apply these to AI.\nThis hack has its limitations, of course. There\u2019s a finite amount of room in Unicode, and many languages to support. Also, some text-to-speech tools may not read Unicode variants aloud, making this article confusing for those who are listening to it. These things need to be addressed. But Unicode offers a ready-made approach that\u2019s already widely adopted. We designed it so that all humans could use the internet; we can also use it to coexist with AI.\nWhat\u2019s more, the companies who steer the future of Unicode\u2014the Unicode Consortium\u2014are many of the same tech giants at the core of generative AI, and three of them just promised to watermark AI content.\nWe have labels for the things we put in our bodies. We should care as much about what we put in our minds. This proposal represents a reasonable, practical, nonpartisan first step down that path\u2014one that can change the way billions of humans consume information with just a software update.\nWIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of viewpoints.

Moving away from fossil fuels remains necessary, but Siddarth Kara captures a painful truth in Cobalt Red: The electric revolution has an underbelly, too. Rechargeable batteries, including those within phones and electric vehicles, are usually manufactured with cobalt, a metal plentiful in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Cobalt Red is a grim investigation into the conditions workers experience within \u201Cartisanal\u201D cobalt mines; child labor is rampant, and death on the job is commonplace. It\u2019s a call to arms to push companies using these batteries to clean up their supply chains, and for those of us who buy consumer devices to interrogate how they\u2019re made and how we treat those who make them.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nDo You Remember Being Born?\nby Sean Michaels\nCOURTESY OF ASTRA HOUSE\nJust as there was a rush of lockdown-themed novels following the first wave of Covid-19, it\u2019s a near-certainty that readers are about to get hit with a deluge of fiction about large language models. It\u2019s too bad, because Canadian novelist and music critic Sean Michaels has already written the definitive novel about art in the age of AI, one that incorporates machine-generated phrases and sentences in an unexpectedly moving way.\nDo You Remember Being Born? follows a 75-year-old poet after she accepts an invitation to spend a week cowriting a poem with an AI trained on her work.

KNOPF\nThe day John Vaillant\u2019s book about Canadian wildfires came out in the US last summer, Canadian wildfires became a temporary American obsession. Skies in the northeastern United States turned orange, hazy, and hazardous as the result of more than 400 infernos in Canada\u2019s vast boreal forests in early June. New York City\u2019s air quality became the worst in the world, choked with smoke blown down from Quebec. Philadelphia urged residents to stay indoors. Fire weather, indeed. Great publicity, but so bleak\u2014like releasing a history of terrorist attacks in September 2001.\nUpon its release, I recommended Vaillant\u2019s gripping account of the 2016 Fort McMurray fire as the best thing to read to understand this particular crisis, and that recommendation stands.

It was good timing for Faux, as he\u2019d opened his rollicking crypto-world travelogue with an account of meeting SBF. In fact, the opening line is a quote from Bankman-Fried: \u201CI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201D SBF promises Faux. \u201CThis was a lie,\u201D Faux writes. This accomplishes two things. First, it signals immediately to the reader that Faux gets it, that he knows Bankman-Fried was full of it. Second, it\u2019s funny.\nNumber Go Up is definitely the best book to read for anyone who wants to understand what happened with SBF and FTX; I\u2019d argue it\u2019s also the best book to give any general-interest reader who wants to learn more about why crypto has crashed and burned.\nBUY ON AMAZON\nBUY ON BOOKSHOP.ORG\nTokens: The Future of Money in the Age of the Platform\nby Rachel O\u2019Dwyer\nCOURTESY OF VERSO\nIrish writer Rachel O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s Tokens also came out shortly before the SBF trial, and it\u2019s also an excellent book to pick up for anyone interested in crypto.

Leftist journalist? Climate activist? Decidedly not the former liberal feminist writer turned conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf? Somehow, people confuse the two Naomis. Klein gets mixed up with Wolf so much, in fact, a Twitter mnemonic was born: \u201CIf the Naomi be Klein you\u2019re doing just fine \/ If the Naomi be Wolf, oh, buddy. Ooooof.\u201D\nThus the basis of Klein\u2019s new book, Doppelganger. Writing hundreds of pages based on Twitter discourse is, of course, a questionable choice. As she is quick to point out, though, Doppelganger is not really about Wolf. She\u2019s merely an entry point to dissect the \u201Cintellectual and ideological mayhem\u201D of the Covid era. How wellness entrepreneurs demonize medicine. How the far right appropriates and warps leftist talking points. How parents see their children as reflections of themselves. In all this, Klein writes, there\u2019s a new doubling going on\u2014distortions of what used to be more straightforward realities.

I am Michael Calore. I'm a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We are joined this week once again by WIRED senior writer Andy Greenberg. Andy, welcome back to the show.\nAndy Greenberg: Thanks to you both for having me on again.\nMichael Calore: It's great to have you back. We're talking about cryptocurrency again on today's show, but it's not really in the way that you might expect. Andy, at the end of last year, you published a book. It's called Tracers in the Dark. It's filled with stories about investigators who have been able to track down criminals by studying their cryptocurrency transactions. These are people who operated on the dark web, places like Silk Road, AlphaBay, and Welcome to Video, a site where users shared child sex abuse videos. These criminal enterprises were funded and fueled by cryptocurrency, primarily bitcoin. Now, since bitcoin has existed, people have been using it to buy and sell all sorts of legal and illegal things online. They may not see that behavior as risky if they're doing something illegal, because they're operating under the assumption that bitcoin transactions are untraceable. Now, that's never really been true, but that belief has persisted anyway. Andy, this myth of anonymity around cryptocurrency is a running theme in your book. How did this myth come to be?\nAndy Greenberg: Well, I have to admit that I am in some sense a part of it, Mike. I wrote the first print magazine piece about bitcoin in 2011\u2014thankfully, in some sense, not for WIRED magazine. I worked at Forbes magazine at the time. I covered this world of anonymity and hackers and surveillance, and I came upon this new phenomenon. Bitcoin was described to me as a kind of untraceable, anonymous digital cash for the internet. I was talking with some of the first bitcoin developers, and even Satoshi Nakamoto, this mysterious creator of bitcoin, had written in this email to a cryptography mailing list that, among other things, participants can be anonymous in this new cryptocurrency world that he or she or whoever they are was describing. So I wrote this first piece in 2011, and I did describe in this Forbes piece how this seemed to be a kind of untraceable digital cash. You could put unmarked bills in a briefcase and send them across the internet to anybody without revealing your identity if you were careful, it seems. Of course, I immediately also was imagining, just being the kind of reporter I am, that this was going to unlock a whole world of money laundering and online drug deals and, I don't know, terrorist financing. All of that, in some sense, did come to pass over the following years because it did seem \u2026 And it wasn't just me. Even Satoshi Nakamoto believed that bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally, as there became more flavors of cryptocurrency, had these anonymous properties. It was only, I would say, at least fast-forward a whole decade, around 2020, that I started to realize how completely wrong I was about this. How not just I was a little bit wrong, but actually 180 fully opposite of correct about this\u2014that bitcoin is actually fully traceable. In fact, it is much easier to follow the money if you can crack and decipher the blockchain with cryptocurrency than even with traditional finance. It was actually when I started to see the Department of Justice credit this one company, Chainalysis, which is a cryptocurrency tracing firm, in one announcement after another, I started looking into this world of investigators who had figured this out much earlier than me. I saw that this small group of detectives had learned to trace cryptocurrency within law enforcements in many cases, and had used this to take down one massive cybercriminal operation after another over the last 10 years. That escalating spree of massive busts and takedowns is the story of this book, Tracers in the Dark.Lauren Goode: Describe in the most accessible way possible how that tracing actually works.\nAndy Greenberg: Well, I think an even better way to start thinking about it is, how in the world, Andy, could you have been so stupid to ever think that bitcoin was untraceable? Because\u2014\nLauren Goode: This podcast is now an Andy Greenberg mea culpa.\nAndy Greenberg: Well, because the whole notion of bitcoin is that it is basically backed up and guaranteed by not a bank or a corporation or a government, but the blockchain, this list of every single transaction. So how in the world could you have ever thought that was private when, those transactions, the notion of the blockchain is that they're copied out to thousands of computers around the world and can't be changed or erased? But the blockchain only records transactions between bitcoin addresses. It doesn't have any identifying information, it seemed to early cryptocurrency users and to me in 2011 or so. But then around 2013, this researcher, Sarah Meiklejohn, at the University of California San Diego, was the first to really look into whether this is true, that the blockchain does provide any privacy, or if there was some way to find patterns in this massive collection of data. She started quickly to find clever tricks to cluster bitcoin addresses and to show that sometimes dozens or hundreds or even millions, in some cases, of addresses could provably be shown to belong to a single person or service or sometimes a dark web drug market like Silk Road, which had come online by that point. Then sometimes you could follow the money from one of those clusters and see bitcoins move from one address to the next and, with other kind of tricks, figure out which path to take when there was a fork in the road until the money hits a cryptocurrency exchange. Cryptocurrency exchanges are legally required by US law anyway to have \u201Cknow your customer\u201D requirements, and they actually do have identifying information on their users. So when people cashed out their bitcoins, traded them for dollars, or vice versa, when they bought their bitcoins with traditional money, you could often get their identifying information with a subpoena with this kind of small collection of tricks. Also, another thing she would do is, she would interact undercover with people in the cryptocurrency world. In doing so, she would sometimes put money into the Silk Road drug market, for instance, and see which address she had interacted with and then know that that address was part of a bigger cluster, and so identify that whole cluster. With this whole bag of tricks that she created, it started to become clear that actually you could start to identify services on the blockchain and follow the money\u2014and in some cases, see real crimes recorded in an indelible, unerasable, unchangeable way in this permanent record. It was only after Sarah Meiklejohn and her coauthors at UCSD published that paper that Chainalysis launched. This Danish tech entrepreneur named Michael Gronager created Chainalysis and automated those tricks and built them into this piece of software that was then made available to law enforcement agencies\u2014who quickly, or not quickly, but bit by bit saw the power of this investigative technique that became a kind of secret super weapon, like a devining rod to track down dark-web criminals and all these people who thought that they were invisible when in fact they were anything but.Michael Calore: That's something that I think is pretty clear when you're reading your book is that there's this cat-and-mouse cycle where criminals are taking greater and greater steps to obfuscate their true identity, and law enforcement is getting savvier and savvier at figuring out people's real identities who are doing illegal things on the dark web. But we should also note that, among all of that, there are still a lot of people, particularly on the consumer end, people buying things on the dark web, who are being really sloppy. What sorts of rookie mistakes were people making that led to them getting caught pretty easily?\nAndy Greenberg: Well, actually, when I was writing for Forbes back in 2013, at this point I was kind of obsessed with the Silk Road drug market, and I did some test transactions. I can now legally say I bought some marijuana for Forbes on it. The sidebar of a story I was writing on the Silk Road, where I was interviewing the Dread Pirate Roberts, the administrator of that dark-web drug market, and I was foolish enough to send, in some cases, bitcoins directly from my Coinbase wallet to the Silk Road. But then in other cases, I think I did send it through intermediary addresses in an attempt to cover my tracks. When I showed all this to Sarah Meiklejohn, she very easily could trace all of my transactions. She had done undercover transactions with the Silk Road. She had identified that cluster, so she could easily see exactly which drug deals I had done. I think that this kind of captures the problem, which is that cryptocurrency users are not that dumb about this. We all thought back then that if you were just a little bit clever, of course, some mistakes would reveal your cryptocurrency transactions in the blockchain, but if you were really clever, if you just stayed a step ahead of the tracers, if you took some obfuscating steps, then you could actually still be more private with cryptocurrency than with traditional money on the internet. But I think Sarah Meiklejohn and then Chainalysis, which is now this $8.6 billion company that has hired every brilliant person they can think of to find these patterns in the blockchain, what they have shown is that it's a better rule of thumb just to say it's impossible. You will not be able to win this cat-and-mouse game, at least with bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are like it. There are now cryptocurrencies that are designed to be far less traceable than bitcoin or ether or those kinds of well-known original cryptocurrencies. But the problem also with this cat-and-mouse game is that you can use state-of-the-art, cutting-edge obfuscation and anonymity techniques, but somebody years later can figure out a new trick to defeat those techniques. Because it's all recorded in the blockchain forever, they can basically go back in time and excavate that evidence and use it against you, sometimes to prove that you committed a crime. So it's like a cat-and-mouse game where the cats can travel back in time to solve the crimes, and the mice have to think years and years ahead into the future, which is basically impossible. So I think it's almost better just to think of most cryptocurrencies as just completely transparent, which is truly the opposite of what they were promised to be in many cases. I think it's also fair to describe it as having served as a kind of trap for people seeking financial privacy and lots of criminals who were seduced by this false idea and then found that law enforcement was able to just turn the lights on and carry out these huge busts where many hundreds of people were arrested.Michael Calore: Wow. Well, let's take a quick break and we'll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: The crypto market has been pretty wild lately. There's all the recent drama with Sam Bankman-Fried and the collapse of the FTX Exchange. There's the cratered market around NFTs, the rapid devaluation and erratic behavior of many of the currencies. Andy, have these recent instabilities in the cryptocurrency market at all slowed down the use of it on the dark web or in other illicit markets?\nAndy Greenberg: I don't think that they have, for the most part. The one big crime that has kind of slowed down because of the fall in the value of cryptocurrency is scamming, because scammers depend on people believing that their cryptocurrency is going to keep going up in value. But on the dark web, cryptocurrency is really just a means of transaction, and it doesn't really matter so much what it's worth. In fact, the fact that bitcoin appreciated massively from the time when I was buying marijuana on the Silk Road in 2013 really now just means that I spent tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins on a few grams of pot, which is unfortunate when you think about it. But the dark web is not the only place where these crimes that are now traced by the tracers who are the central detectives in my book are taking place. There are also just straight-up thefts that are a huge part of the dark side of the crypto world. When FTX collapsed, in the midst of that collapse, which was like a traditional finance story in a way\u2014an over-leveraged bank or something, or a Lehman Brothers or maybe like a Theranos story. But there's also a straight-up crime story here, where about half a billion dollars of FTX's funds were actually just stolen in the midst of its bankruptcy, and we don't know by whom still. The bizarre thing about the blockchain is that all of these tracers can watch this theft happen in real time. We can see these hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency taken out of FTX and then moved around. They seem to be packaged to try to launder them. But because it's all so transparent and traceable, it's going to be very difficult for whoever took that money to cash it out or spend it or get away with this crime in a way where they won't be identified. So we'll probably soon know if the person who did that was some sort of inside embezzler or external hackers who were trying to take advantage of the chaos of FTX's meltdown.\nLauren Goode: Do you see a mainstream future for some of the more privacy-focused coins, like monero\u2014am I saying that correctly, monero?\u2014or will they be kept at arm's length by legitimate financial institutions?\nAndy Greenberg: It's really interesting to watch. I mean, monero is one that is being adopted. Monero, for the people who maybe haven't heard of it, it's not the most popular cryptocurrency by any means, but it is designed to be much less traceable than bitcoin and to tangle up its blockchain and obfuscate the amounts and make it hard to see who is sending money to whom. And monero is being adopted by dark web markets. One of the big stories in this book is the hunt for and the takedown of the kingpin of AlphaBay, which was this dark web market that became 10 times the size of the Silk Road. Now, years after AlphaBay was taken down, it actually reappeared in 2021, and now only accepts monero, which is a sign of the cat-and-mouse game, as Mike put it, that is occurring and the ways that people are starting to wise up to the traceability of bitcoin at least. But we see that cat-and-mouse game continuing because it does actually seem like sometimes monero, much to the surprise of all of these people using it, can sometimes be traced. monero people hate it when I point this out. In this big case that happened about a year ago where these two New Yorkers were arrested and accused of money laundering \u2026 You probably heard of this case because the woman in this couple had posted these terrible, super cringey rap videos on YouTube. $3.6 billion was seized from this couple, the biggest seizure of money of any kind in US criminal history. They had actually transferred some of that money into monero. Yet, you can see in court documents that the IRS criminal investigators, who were the central detectives in that case, continued to follow it and to identify them as the ones holding it. There's actually even leaked Chainalysis documents that appeared on the dark web that show that Chainalysis says to its law enforcement customers that it can trace monero in the majority of cases. So even when people, even now, believe that they're using a privacy coin, something that's less traceable, they're often still going to be surprised, I think, by how clever the tracers have become, how hard it is to use cryptocurrency anonymously. But I feel like I have to also mention that there is a newer cryptocurrency, zcash, that does seem to be truly untraceable, that uses these new, almost magical-seeming cryptography tricks called zero-knowledge proofs to basically fully encrypt its blockchain, so that there is no information for blockchain analysis or tracing of any kind. That may be finally the untraceable cryptocurrency that people believed bitcoin was. Yeah, as you say, Lauren, it's going to be really interesting to see if zcash is more adopted, and if it is, if it becomes this popular tool for crime or what people once called crypto-anarchy, carving out a space where you can't collect taxes, you can do any black market transaction you want, will that lead to some sort of regulatory backlash where regulators try to ban zcash or prevent exchanges from letting you buy and sell it?Lauren Goode: Well, I'm definitely not an expert in regulation, but I do think a lot about permanence on the internet, what is permanent and what is not, and how we've sometimes deluded ourselves into thinking that some of the things we do, the actions we take, like using cryptocurrency to make a purchase on the dark web or even just moving something into the trash on our desktops, that that somehow is untraceable, that something is vanishing when actually we are laying down these infinitesimal bits, these 1s and 0s that are now the mesh network of our lives. And it's really pretty permanent.\nAndy Greenberg: In some ways, cryptocurrency is a little parable about how people think about committing crimes on the internet, or just their privacy, that we are all leaving this digital exhaust trail. In some cases, you can see these in the stories of the book as well. In one case, the administrator of AlphaBay was first identified because he leaked his email address in a welcome email to the AlphaBay user forums. Although he fixed that problem within days, years later, an anonymous tipster gave that email address to the DEA, and that's how they first learned his name. They later proved his identity and dispelled any doubts and were able to charge him because they traced his cryptocurrency. Yeah, we leave these breadcrumbs behind that we're not aware of. I just think that it turns out the cryptocurrency is maybe the most ironic, the clearest, craziest example of that, because people really thought that they were invisible. In fact, they were leaving totally clear, indelible trails that show every transaction that you make for all time. There are cases where, for instance, IRS criminal investigations identified the alleged creator of a bitcoin money laundering service called Bitcoin Fog by tracing his transactions before he even successfully launched the site, 10 years earlier. So it is just a true, as Edward Snowden would say, a permanent record that, for good or ill, can be used to solve crimes, but also to expose human behavior in a way that we're really just not ready for.\nMichael Calore: Well, thanks Andy for coming on the show and talking about this. Let's take a break, and when we come back we'll do our recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore:  This is the last segment of our show where each of us recommends something our listeners might like. Andy, you get to go first.\nAndy Greenberg: Oh, wow. Well, I have to say I was going to recommend a book called You Are Not Expected to Understand This, which is a collection of essays about lines of code that my WIRED colleague, Lily Hay Newman, contributed to. But Lily, it turns out, already recommended this book on the show, she tells me, a couple weeks ago. So I have to come up with another one. Although, I have to say, that as a really delightful collection of little parables about the history of computing. I guess instead I will recommend this game that I have been obsessed with for years now called Getting Over It. It seems completely ridiculous, but I found it to be kind of profound. You basically are this naked man in a pot with a hammer, and you have to use this hammer to climb a mountain of junk, basically. It's very hard. You constantly can fall and basically lose all the progress that you have made. You can't die in any way. There's no lives. You just sometimes fall and lose the weeks and weeks of climbing that you have put into the game. It's like this little experiment in extreme frustration. The creator of the game, Bennett Foddy, talks to you actually throughout the game, telling you his theories about the nature of failure and frustration and playing bits of songs and poetry that are all around the theme of just the difficulties of life. I find it almost inspiring in a way. I have actually now played through it hundreds of times. I think I'm in the top 5 percent of players in terms of how many times I've played through it, worldwide. Now my 6-year-old son has gotten curious about it, and I just sit and watch him play it. I find that, for a 6-year-old, it's an interesting practice and how frustrated can he become and can he tolerate, which is an important thing for a kid to figure out. Yeah, Getting Over It, I recommended it to everyone.Michael Calore: Nice. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is another work of Andy's actually. We're just recommending each other's work on this podcast. We really do like each other this much here at WIRED.\nAndy Greenberg: It's so incestuous, but I appreciate it. Thank you.\nLauren Goode: I know I sometimes make fun of Mike for talking about being vegan, not being vegan itself, just that you talk about it. But Andy's latest story is going to make you want to avoid eating American-raised pork, because it has made me vow not to eat anymore pork. It's a story about how an animal rights activist group, which Andy has written about before, and WIRED revealed using spy cameras what really happens inside of carbon-dioxide stunning chambers, which are used to slaughter pigs. It's pretty horrific. Food companies have claimed that these CO2 chambers lead to what they would say is painless loss of consciousness and death for the animals. But these videos and Andy's story reveal that, for these pigs, the deaths are anything but painless. It's a pretty hard read, and the videos are even harder to watch. But if you can stomach it, I recommend reading that story. Mike, what's your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: My recomm\u2014\nLauren Goode: Perhaps recommend some vegan food for us.\nMichael Calore: My recommendation is stop eating bacon.\nLauren Goode: There you go. You said it so much more simply than I did.\nMichael Calore: I'm going to recommend a book. It's called Art Is Life. It's by Jerry Saltz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic of New York Magazine and just all around fantastic writer. It is a collection of the last 25 years or so of his essays and criticism and profiles and writing about the art world, particularly artists who are challenging some long-held beliefs in the art world, and artists who are trying new things and stretching the boundaries, and artists who he feels are overrated or overexposed and his thoughts about them. If you have any interest in contemporary art, then you know Jerry Saltz, and you know that you should read this book, so I'm just giving you a nudge. You should definitely check it out. It's brand-new. I'm consuming the audio book, so it is kind of fun to hear his voice read back to me the words that I've read before, not knowing what his voice sounds like. Also, I own the book in physical form, and it's just as enjoyable in either medium. So that's my recommendation, Art Is Life, by Jerry Saltz.\nLauren Goode: The other day, you and I were having a Slack conversation about something completely unrelated. I was like, \u201COh, something, something,\u201D about the BART from Berkeley, and you just replied with a photo of Jerry Saltz, and you wrote, \"Jerry Saltz, exclamation point. I'm currently reading\/listening to his book.\"\nMichael Calore: Well, because he was on Kara's podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, that's great.\nMichael Calore: He was on Kara Swisher's podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, but you heard about Jerry Saltz here first.\nMichael Calore: Yes, yes, indeed. Well, that is our show. Andy, thanks again for joining us.\nAndy Greenberg: Thanks to you both. It's always fun.\nLauren Goode: Always fun having you on, Andy.\nMichael Calore: Once again, the book is called Tracers in the Dark. It's out now. You can buy it anywhere, and you could read some long excerpts of the book on WIRED.com, including the stories about the operations to take down AlphaBay and Welcome to Video. Just check the show notes. We'll link to those there. Thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter and Mastodon. Again, just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth. We will be back next week, provided all these new chatbot search engines don't take our jobs.

The space reverberates with the hum of 3D printers, the devices that gave 3D his nom de guerre. A network engineer, 3D comes across as controlled and cautious, but from time to time, mostly when he\u2019s speaking about his printers, a playful grin appears on his face. He spoke on condition that WIRED would not reveal his real name or show his face. \u201CMy parents would kill me if they [knew] what I\u2019m up to,\u201D he says. Not only does 3D face the risk of arrest, torture, and execution for his part in the revolution, but the military would also not hesitate to arrest his parents if they were to discover 3D\u2019s identity.\nMyanmar\u2019s borderlands have been plagued by civil conflicts since the end of World War II. Rebel groups, often delineated along ethnic lines, have sought autonomy from a state that was stitched together by the British Empire, and which unified distinct ancient kingdoms. The civil war escalated dramatically after the military seized power in February 2021, reversing years of tentative democratic progress. Thousands of people took to the streets to protest, but the military cracked down with stunning brutality, killing hundreds of civilians across the country. Many people took up arms against the regime, or joined existing insurgencies. Today, over 250 rebel groups are fighting against the military dictatorship in all corners of the country, turning Myanmar into a patchwork of front lines, no-man\u2019s-land, and islands controlled by a mosaic of insurgents.\n3D joined the peaceful protests in the eastern town of Loikaw in the aftermath of the coup and witnessed the bloody response. \u201CThey fired with live ammunition at the protesters and killed many,\u201D he says. After he saw that, 3D decided to join the revolution. He enrolled in an armed insurgent group that consisted of civilian volunteers like himself, named the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF). What he found was a resistance movement that was massively outgunned. \u201CWe had nothing when our resistance began two years ago, and we took up against a military titan,\u201D 3D says. \u201CThat\u2019s when I thought, I have to find a way to make weapons from scratch.\u201D Before the revolution began, 3D already owned a 3D printer. \u201CBut I just used it as a hobby. When I saw the urgent need for weapons, I decided to find a way to use my 3D printer.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Today, 3D\u2019s printers are at the heart of the rebel group\u2019s in-house weapons program, producing drones, stabilizers for mortars, and other munitions to support the pro-democracy fighters. These are tools that have become closely associated with Ukraine\u2019s scrambled, open sourced defense against Russia\u2019s invasion, but, as 3D\u2019s work on Myanmar\u2019s front lines shows, the bootstrapping of warfare has become a global phenomenon.\n\u201CWithout 3D printing, someone can manufacture a very high-quality weapon,\u201D Yannick Veilleux-Lepage, assistant professor of political science at the Royal Military College of Canada, says. \u201CBut that does require a great deal of skill. You need to be a competent metal worker, and that takes a long time. With a 3D-printed firearm, it doesn\u2019t take very long to go from no skill to [creating] something lethal. That\u2019s how things are changing, the lethality and the ease of it.\u201DPHOTOGRAPH: DAPHNE WESDORP\nThe first weapons that 3D manufactured for the revolution were FGC-9s, 3D-printed semiautomatic rifles. The blueprint for the weapon was created in 2018 by a gun designer using the pseudonym JStark1809. Over the course of several years, the designs were uploaded to several easily accessible online platforms, including Odysee, an open source blockchain-based media website. FGC stands for \u201Cfuck gun control,\u201D as the gun can be manufactured without any regulated commercial gun components. It is composed of a mixture of custom 3D-printed parts, readily manufacturable metal components, and store-bought screws, springs, and bolts. JStark\u2019s motto, \u201Clive free or die,\u201D is engraved on a tag around 3D\u2019s neck.\n3D produced the first FGC-9 in the early months of the coup, and the guns were used on the front line. But it soon became clear that plastic firearms weren\u2019t up to the rigors of the battlefield, and the 3D-printed guns have been relegated to use in defensive actions or limited hit-and-run attacks. When it became clear there was no longer a need for plastic rifles, 3D started to think about how his 3D printer could help the revolution in different ways. So, in December 2022, he began working on a drone.\nInspired by a Ukrainian-made drone called the Punisher, the Liberator-MK1 was his first attempt. This small, fixed-wing reusable aircraft could carry up to 1.5 kilograms of explosives, and has already been deployed at Myanmar\u2019s scattered front lines. The frame of the drone was 3D-printed and then covered with fiberglass. The other components\u2014its battery, motor, and control surfaces\u2014have to be smuggled across the border from Thailand. As cars and fuel are both expensive and scarce in rebel-held territories, the Liberator needed to be transportable by scooter, and therefore had to be compact. \u201CThere were so many things to take into account while making the design,\u201D 3D says. \u201CBut the biggest problem we had was a weak wing structure. It couldn\u2019t support the plane\u2019s weight and broke in the middle.\u201DIn February this year, 3D refined the designs with the MK2. All told, it costs around $5,000 to produce a drone. Once all the components are in the country, they can be assembled in around two days.\nThe merging of 3D-printing technology and drone development has opened up new possibilities for both conventional military development as well as for non-state actors such as Myanmar\u2019s anti-junta fighters. Military organizations have adopted 3D-printing technologies to produce sophisticated, low-cost, disposable aircraft\u2014most visibly, and arguably most successfully, in Ukraine. This convergence has been particularly valuable to some non-state actors, like Myanmar\u2019s rebel groups. When you lack foreign allies and your borders are sealed, you need to be innovative to get hold of weapons and bypass the conventional supply chain.\nGroups like the KNDF, which consists of mostly millennials and Gen Zs, thrive on having digital natives who can find and tweak designs online. Manuals on how to weaponize and build drones circulate online, and non-state actors often learn from the tactics of other groups that are disconnected from them, or even their enemy. When the war in Ukraine started, Ukrainians were even translating Islamic State manuals that contained instructions on how to weaponize drones, in order to prepare the population to wage an insurgency in case the Russians attacked. As Veilleux-Lepage says: \u201CNo technology is neutral. Every technology has essentially the purpose for which it is built, but can be used in various ways, by people with different ideologies.\u201D\nIn Myanmar\u2019s case, what these weaponized drones offer is an opportunity to strike back in an incredibly asymmetrical war. While the rebels struggle to access basic munitions, Myanmar\u2019s military has obtained at least $1 billion in weaponry and materials needed to make weapons since the coup, according to a United Nations report that was published in May 2023. The cost of that imbalance is measured in lives. The past summer has been the deadliest for the pro-democracy rebels in the past two-and-a-half years, and casualties are reported daily.\nOn a misty morning, a dusty pickup arrives carrying the remains of a young fighter. \u201CHe died on the way here. He was injured in an airstrike,\u201D the driver says. After the fighter is carried out of the car, a medic lifts his arm and inspects the fatal wound in his side, where a piece of shrapnel has pierced his body. On his arm, he has a self-made tattoo that says \u201Chappy,\u201D covered in blood. To honor fallen fighters, three shots are fired in the air. \u201CBut even those shots are blanks,\u201D says the deputy chief commander of the KNDF, who uses the alias \u201CMaui\u201D (named for the main character from the Disney film Moana\u2014a giant, and the archetype of a warrior). \u201CAmmunition is like gold for us. We don\u2019t have the luxury to waste a single bullet.\u201D\nWhile they\u2019re training, KNDF volunteers are given only two .22-mm bullets to try to hit a target with. \u201CThe military junta can buy all the heavy weapons they want, but we barely have bullets to shoot with,\u201D says Maui. \u201CReal practice is done during active combat. But [the military] still can\u2019t defeat us on the ground, so they attack us from the sky.\u201DPHOTOGRAPH: DAPHNE WESDORP\nWith his drones, 3D hopes to redress that imbalance. One of his team members, a young man wearing a stained purple T-shirt, grumbles in irritation as he unsuccessfully attempts to set up the Liberator drone for a test run. \u201CBad compass health,\u201D a voice from the drone repeats, as it lies on the dusty earth. \u201CThat means we have a problem with the compass,\u201D 3D says, while he walks over to help his friend. \u201CWithout it, the drone won\u2019t be able to be controlled properly.\u201D\nTesting the drones is conducted at various undisclosed locations. There are spies, who might report on their position, but also junta scouting planes. When they hear the roar of an aircraft, 3D and the team operate like a well-oiled machine. Someone sprints to the drone, whose white fuselage stands out against the iron-rich red soil, and covers it with a dark net. The others hide between the foliage and under improvised bamboo roofs. Even though there is no way the scouting plane can hear their voices, no one speaks a word.\n\u201CThe launching process is the make-or-break moment,\u201D 3D says after the scouting plane has passed. \u201COnce it\u2019s in the air, we know there\u2019s no reason to worry, but sometimes it crashes due to malfunctions. There are many errors we need to consider. That\u2019s why we continue to refine our designs. Several drones have already been lost in midair.\u201D\nWhen everything is ready, a team member raises the drone high above their head in an open area, preparing for a running start. Once given the green light, he sprints a few meters, leaps, and releases the drone into the sky. 3D and the others cheer as the drone takes off, the craft growing smaller and smaller until it becomes merely a black dot against the blue sky. However, despite the promising launch from the ground, 3D\u2019s expression soon turns to disappointment. \u201CIt fell about 500 meters from here,\u201D he says.\nTwo members of the team jump on a scooter and drive off to the crash site. All that is left from the $5,000 drone is a small bundle of burned wires. 3D collects the parts that he hopes are still usable. He suspects a cable from the motor came loose, causing the drone to crash, which led to the battery exploding. \u201COff to the next one,\u201D he says, with a strained laugh.\nEven though 3D\u2019s drones have successfully attacked military command centers and outposts, it is not yet clear if they can indeed make a significant change on the battlefield. But right now, for Myanmar\u2019s rebel groups, the Liberator is the only way to visit some of the same terror they experience on their enemy. \u201C[The military] can\u2019t win on the ground, so they resort to bombing us from above. We can\u2019t defend ourselves. All we can do is hide,\u201D 3D says. \u201CDrones are the only thing we have to make them feel even a fraction of the trauma we feel when they bomb us with their fighter jets.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY DAPHNE WESDORP","title":"The Rebel Drone Maker of Myanmar","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-rebel-drone-maker-of-myanmar\/","tags":["","DRONES","DEFENSE","GUNS","3-D PRINTING","MILITARY"]},{"date":"01.06.2023","summary":"Try as they might, crypto companies pressured by the trading platform\u2019s collapse are failing to bail themselves out.","post_content":"GENESIS GLOBAL TRADING, one of crypto\u2019s oldest and most storied institutions, is in dire straits.

In 2021 alone, the company issued $131 billion in loans and set up $116.5 billion in trades. To fund these loans, Genesis borrows from individuals and institutions that own large quantities of coins, also known as whales, who receive a cut of profits in return. \nWhile the crypto hype train barreled on unchecked, Genesis was on a hot streak\u2014but its luck ran out in 2022. The lender has been in trouble since July, when hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed, taking with it $1.2 billion of the $2.36 billion it had borrowed from the firm. Genesis again found itself on the wrong side of a collapse in the autumn; when FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, the firm lost $175 million stored with the exchange.\nDigital Currency Group (DCG), parent company of Genesis, swooped in with bailouts on both occasions. Despite the assistance, the \u201Cunprecedented market turmoil\u201D created by the FTX situation forced Genesis to freeze withdrawals and begin to hunt for emergency funding. But just like FTX, a rescue package for Genesis has not materialized.\nThe frothiness of the crypto market in 2021 spread fear of missing out among investors that attracted huge sums of money. But that FOMO is now long gone, replaced by a suspicion of both the promises and accounting practices of large crypto companies in light of the allegations of fraud at FTX.Venture capital investment in crypto is drying up, according to a recent paper released by market data house PitchBook. After a \u201Cbreakout year\u201D in 2021, in which $21 billion of capital flooded into the industry, appetite for crypto investment is collapsing rapidly. By Q3 2022, funding was down 34.3 percent year-on-year, and the volume of deals had fallen to a two-year low.\nIn Genesis\u2019 case, investors have been put off by a lack of clarity over the size of the cash injection necessary to plug the hole, says David Bailey, CEO at Bitcoin Magazine, who also leads an activist group that represents the interests of investors in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a DCG subsidiary. He describes the shortfall as \u201Cmassive and unknown in scope.\u201D\nBrad Harrison, who leads the team behind decentralized lending protocol Venus, paints a similar picture. A Genesis bankruptcy would come as no surprise in the aftermath of the \u201Ctectonic\u201D events that shook the crypto industry over the past year, he says. But as for the specifics, \u201Cwe\u2019re all just guessing what happens behind closed doors.\u201D\nBailey also claims potential white knights have been spooked by the murky financial relationship between Genesis and DCG. Specifically, the \u201Cinappropriate intercompany loans\u201D that were \u201Conly disclosed after everything went sideways.\u201D These loans mean that \u201CDCG has direct exposure to Genesis,\u201D he explains. The parent company is \u201Con the hook,\u201D making it \u201Ctough to raise the funds it needs.\u201D (DCG has been approached for comment; Silbert has previously suggested these intercompany loans are nothing out of the ordinary.) Genesis declined to comment.\nAlso \u201Con the hook\u201D is Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The company\u2019s yield farming service, which allows customers to earn interest on their crypto, sits on top of the Genesis platform. But when the lender halted withdrawals, $900 million of Gemini customers\u2019 assets were left stranded\u2014and will remain so if Genesis declares bankruptcy.\nOn January 2, having grown frustrated with the lack of progress, Cameron Winklevoss delivered an ultimatum to Barry Silbert, founder of DCG. In an open letter published on Twitter, Winklevoss accused Silbert of \u201Cengaging in bad-faith stall tactics\u201D and implored him to \u201Ccommit to working together to solve this problem by January 8.\u201D Silbert fired back, asserting that Winklevoss had misrepresented the situation, but did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Neither Gemini nor Winklevoss returned a request for clarification over what might happen if this deadline is missed.\nBack in November, Max Galka, founder of blockchain analytics company Elementus, told WIRED that Genesis is \u201Can order of magnitude less intertwined than FTX\u201D with other large industry players. The implication was that the ripple effects of a bankruptcy would be less severe, and fewer regular people would be caught up. But he also warned that the FTX fallout would not end with Genesis.\nHis prediction was confirmed yesterday when the NYSE-listed Silvergate Bank revealed in early quarterly filings that it was forced to offload $8.1 billion in assets to cover a surge in withdrawals triggered by the FTX debacle. The bank, which stores funds for many crypto companies\u2014including FTX and its subsidiaries\u2014said it had suffered losses of $718 million as a result of the forced sale. It will also have to \u201Csubstantively reduce its workforce\u201D in order to mitigate its new \u201Ceconomic realities.\u201D\nUS regulators have made unsympathetic noises since the implosion of FTX. In an unprecedented joint statement on January 3, the US Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency told banks they serve cryptocurrency customers at their own peril.\nThe trio pointed to risks from \u201Cfraud and scams\u201D to the potential for crypto firms to misrepresent their financial health. They also claimed that tokens stored on decentralized networks are \u201Chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201D\nGenesis has tangled itself in its own financial gymnastics, while Silvergate has been caught in the crypto crossfire\u2014and tarnished by association. The plight of both suggests that few in the crypto industry will escape the FTX saga unscathed. \u201CWhenever there\u2019s a hole like this,\u201D Bailey says, \u201Csomeone has got to eat shit.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"No One Will Escape the FTX Fallout","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/no-one-will-escape-the-ftx-fallout\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","FINANCE","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN"]},{"date":"01.06.2023","summary":"The next big thing in tech isn\u2019t the blockchain or the metaverse\u2014it\u2019s a mind-bending wave of algorithmic content machines.","post_content":"LATE LAST YEAR, I attended an event hosted by Google to celebrate its AI advances.

But they\u2019re far from a magic bullet.","post_content":"WHEN ELON MUSK took over Twitter last year, many users migrated to the free and open-source platform Mastodon. Mastodon, like other decentralized social media, isn\u2019t owned by one of the major players in tech and doesn\u2019t rely on one company\u2019s centralized system. Instead, it operates on independently run servers. Other decentralized social media platforms, like Steemit, use blockchain technology to ensure that data can be stored on servers anywhere in the world.\nThe exodus from Twitter to Mastodon was spurred by wariness of Musk and concern that the platform would disintegrate in his hands. Indeed, distrust of established social media in general is high, thanks to data breaches, inconsistent leadership, and dubious geopolitical ties. In response, proponents of decentralized social networks claim that these alternatives increase transparency and give users more control over their online experiences. But decentralization also comes with downsides, many of which reflect larger cultural ills.\nWIRED OPINION\nABOUT\nJessica Maddox is an assistant professor of digital media technology at the University of Alabama.\nChief among the issues fomented by a decentralized web is a rise in conspiratorial thinking. As Virginia Commonwealth University professor David Golumbia argues in his book The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism, conspiracy theories that are deeply rooted in American life are governed by much of the same logic that underpins decentralized tech. Using cryptocurrency as an example, Golumbia charts how many of the beliefs held by die-hard proponents of bitcoin depend on far-right thinking. Decentralized banking relies on distrust in existing financial institutions, promising crypto-enthusiasts more control over their money. As a result, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may be attractive to individuals who think the US Federal Reserve is stealing value from ordinary people, or that \u201Celites\u201D have too much power and may be pulling the strings behind the government. More often than not, those elites are coded as \u201CJewish control,\u201D playing into long-standing anti-Semitic tropes. While many individuals who invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not espouse these extremist, far-right views, the systems they are entering into often do.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow Online Conspiracy Groups Compare to Cults\nDecentralization emerges as the solution to seemingly questionable established institutions\u2014be they banks or platforms\u2014because it promotes individual ownership. It is predicated on seeking out a place to protect one\u2019s self and one's specific group. Distrust, like that described by Golumbia, and the feelings prompting many to flee Twitter for Mastodon, often manifest into conspiracy, augmented when institutions are inconsistent or have acted badly. Pushing for decentralization doesn\u2019t make users inherently conspiratorial. But when they decamp to a new platform\u2014even one that is decentralized and purportedly more trustworthy\u2014because they\u2019re wary of the old one, they often bring this distrust-qua-conspiracy with them.\nDecentralized social media are also built to be suspect of the outside world. This is evident in Mastodon\u2019s \u201Cfederated network\u201D of servers, which users connect across, much like how you can write to a Hotmail email from a Gmail account. New users pick one server to join when signing up, based on common interests or professional affiliation. However, these servers can also block each other. This is most likely a content moderation feature to promote safety, but it can also be used to hide things you disagree with or don\u2019t want to see. For example, a Mastodon server of hundreds of journalists who joined after Musk began banning tech reporters on Twitter is currently blocked by over 200 other servers, who claim the reporters are malevolently surveilling others. It\u2019s easy to imagine how decentralized and therefore more siloed online spaces like these federated Mastodon servers could wind up provoking conspiracy thinking.\nOn other decentralized Web3 platforms, conspiratorial ideologies come to the fore in more explicit ways. For example, Steemit\u2019s instructions for new users advise that the first thing you should do when you join is to \u201Cwrite down your master\/owner keys on a piece of paper, and keep the paper in a safe, secure place. Anyone can use your password to log in, to transfer money, to comment on others, and fish your friends. What would you call it? \u2018Master\/owner key\u2019 is not enough.\u201D The platform suggests that users must fence themselves off from the dangers of the digital world because other spaces and users cannot be trusted.These platforms have shortcomings on the practical level, as well. If a user needs a different app for everything they want to do online, we\u2019re looking at a massive increase in app fatigue, the exhaustion that comes when users must download and engage with more platforms to have a semblance of an online presence and community. While the platforms offered by Meta and Alphabet are certainly not without issue, it is hard to deny the convenience of their established existence, which makes it possible to communicate, be entertained, shop, and more all in the same place. By contrast, users of decentralized platforms will need to download a slew of apps for everything they want to do online, because these features will no longer all exist in one place.\nThe specter of app fatigue may also make it more difficult to convince new users to join decentralized social media. While there will always be early adopters interested in coming on board, new platforms will need to meet casual users where they\u2019re at to fully populate the decentralized web. But the language and features of Web3 are not always intuitive to individuals who are not habitually online, which could make it hard to boost uptake. This may be one reason the uptick in Mastodon users has stalled since its initial surge last fall.\nWe can, and should, always strive to build better, more accessible, and more inclusive technology. But decentralizing the web into walled-off silos seems unlikely to accomplish this goal. Platforms can never outrun their origin stories. Web3 will never be able to shed its conspiratorial origins. Distrust of existing tech institutions and separatist urges will always be part and parcel of decentralized social media. What that means moving forward remains to be seen, but conspiracy, distrust, and inclusion can certainly never go hand in hand.\nWIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of viewpoints.

Now companies may face a funding gap.","post_content":"WHEN REAL-ESTATE-STARTUP COFOUNDER Vai Gupta visited downtown San Francisco from the suburbs last year, he borrowed a conference room at a branch of Silicon Valley Bank to host a quick business meeting, just like he has several times over the past decade. Gupta also has leaned on the bank for networking events, financial tutorials, and discount codes for business software and services. Other banks offer competing perks, but SVB\u2019s total package had won Gupta\u2019s loyalty, until the tech-focused financial giant cratered last week.\nNow Gupta is among thousands of customers wondering whether they will ever again find a financial institution that offers the unique blend of benefits, savvy, and speed that SVB delivered to entrepreneurs. Founded about 40 years ago by a Stanford University professor who teamed with banking experts after noticing students struggling to fund business ideas, Silicon Valley Bank treated startup founders like royalty long before their companies ever generated a profit or even raised significant funding.\nBy offering loans, guidance, and bountiful bottles of fine wine and all-expenses-paid ski trips to companies too small in sales for bigger banks to handhold, SVB quickly became the go-to bank for anyone intersecting with the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s globally known startup community. Clients who have grown with SVB\u2019s help include Cisco, Coinbase, and Etsy.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nBut a bad bet on interest rates staying low\u2014they have risen sharply since the start of 2022\u2014and poor crisis communications led to its customers launching a run on the bank over fears about SVB\u2019s financial health. Regulators took control of the bank on March 10, and the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in over the weekend to fully guarantee the remaining deposits.\nSVB\u2019s future remains uncertain, and several entrepreneurs say they are finding that financial institutions rushing to fill the void are falling short in matching its suite of services and extras. Most of all, they wonder what it might mean for them and startups more broadly to lose a trusted partner that helped early-stage companies and founders survive difficult times and secure mortgages or loans others wouldn\u2019t provide. \n\u201CThey understand our innovation ecosystem and build all of their offerings around that,\u201D says Hemant Taneja, the chief executive and managing director of General Catalyst, a venture capital firm that banks with SVB. \u201CThey have the trust of the VC community that they will help these companies through thick and thin.\u201D\nTaneja\u2019s firm joined several others yesterday calling for companies to restore their deposits and lending with SVB, describing it as \u201Cnow one of the safest and most secure banks in the country.\u201D The bank posted on its website yesterday that under the oversight of federal regulators it is honoring all existing loans and welcoming new clients. SVB deferred a request for comment for this story to the FDIC, which declined the invitation. A source at the bank says a few dozen companies expressed interest yesterday in securing new loans.\nSVB's at-least temporary demise has added to existing economic uncertainty in tech. Rising interest rates have throttled startups\u2019 access to cheap cash from investors over the past year. Losing access to the loans and connections that SVB provided could accelerate the collapse of some companies and force others to pare their ambitions\u2014and potentially payrolls\u2014until consumer and investor confidence in the economy rebounds.Gupta, the real estate entrepreneur, is already missing SVB. He wires money internationally at least a couple of times a month for his startup BonfireDAO, which aims to lower barriers to buying properties using blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. He estimates that Chase, his new bank, will charge him $5,000 a year for the transfers, which SVB provided for free.\nSVB also offered customers freebies through a dedicated section in its mobile app long before other banks dangled similar discounts to startups, says Gupta, who from SVB has taken advantage of Amazon Web Services cloud computing credits and free DocuSign e-signature services. He attended over a dozen SVB events, including sessions on finding cofounders and pitching investors. The bank would also let him stop by for a free lunch or to use a meeting room during business trips. \u201CThey were very hospitable,\u201D Gupta says. He says he might now have to shell out for a WeWork membership.\nEntrepreneur Adam Zbar has enjoyed the use of an SVB ski house with a dock on California\u2019s Lake Tahoe. As CEO of meal delivery company Sunbasket, he would use it to host weeklong retreats for his management team. The bank would bring in a top chef for a night and exclusive wines from SVB\u2019s winery clients. \u201CIt was phenomenal,\u201D Zbar says.\nSVB sponsorships also helped pay for trips for Los Angeles tech entrepreneurs to ski at Mammoth Mountain in California and surf at a human-made ranch constructed amid farms, says Zach James, co-CEO of ad tech company Zefr. SVB would take clients to race fancy cars, go backstage at music festivals, and meet vintners at private sessions at Napa Valley wineries to the point that it hosted 300 wine-related events one year.\nRivals had ramped up. JPMorgan Chase announced hiring several top bankers from SVB over the past few years. First Republic Bank was making progress adding tech clients. But their main focus remained elsewhere. \nLaw firms and recruiting and consulting companies are also major sponsors of tech industry schmoozing, though none of them\u2014and certainly no other bank\u2014came close to matching SVB\u2019s largesse toward companies far away from listing on Wall Street, the entrepreneurs and several investors say. \u201CThey were one of the key underwriters of the community,\u201D says Paige Craig, who has been a customer of the bank as an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist. \u201CIt\u2019s a big hole to fill.\u201D\nFor all the fancy perks, the ease of borrowing money from SVB has been the biggest draw for many companies. Startups take out bank loans to diversify their financing, and they often can secure the dollars without giving up as many shares as they have to provide venture investors.\nZefr\u2019s James has taken out loans for his company several times through SVB after shopping around. In some cases, the bank takes a small ownership stake in the borrowers. Other times it defers principal payments for a year or two or allows for repayment in a single lump sum. \u201CIt was the catch-all for startups,\u201D James says of SVB.Generally, it offered among the least-restrictive terms and equally competitive interest rates, entrepreneurs say. If a borrower failed, SVB was known to handle it more gracefully than other lenders. Effectively, according to language seen by WIRED, SVB would support companies as long as their venture capital backers, often clients of the bank, did not abandon them. \u201CBankers become a lifeline when you get into trouble, and if they stand by you, I take that seriously,\u201D says James of his loyalty to the now crushed bank. \nRoger Smith, SVB\u2019s founding CEO, told the Computer History Museum in 2014 that the bank did not sacrifice profits by being flexible. \u201CWhen the music stops, we want two chairs, not just one,\u201D he said. \u201CBut we were able to help people grow and \u2026 we were part of the flow.\u201D\nJust ask Zbar, the former Sunbasket chief. He dreamed up the meal delivery company in 2013 after he had spent through the venture funding he had raised for a different idea. He had no money to pay back a bank loan. But his banker at SVB loved the Sunbasket pitch, and investors were supportive, so SVB agreed to allow Zbar to keep operating month-to-month on new terms as the food venture progressed.\n\u201CI remember having some unpleasant conversations where I was like, wow, you know, you took a piece of my hide, but my business still survived,\u201D says Zbar, now chief executive of HamsaPay, which uses blockchain for commercial loan financing. He believes other banks are less flexible than SVB. \u201CThey just freeze it, and you're done,\u201D he says.  Zbar even welcomed his SVB banker as a bachelor-party guest. \nTo be sure, Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s reliance on relationships and knowledge of venture capitalists to guide its lending decisions raises questions about whether it perpetuated exclusion of women, racial minorities, or other groups historically overlooked by the startup financing industry. Investors say some of those issues may be valid, but the bank did open up opportunities.\nSVB fronted cash to people of underrepresented backgrounds trying to buy into venture capital funds, says the investor Craig, who runs Outlander VC. It provided home mortgages to investors early in their careers who couldn\u2019t get them elsewhere, based on a deep understanding of the tech companies its customers were betting on, Craig says. \u201CI really hope they rebuild and reconstitute. No one understood founders and innovators as well as SVB,\u201D he says.  \nAs entrepreneurs have fanned out to other banks in recent days to shift their deposits from SVB, their experiences have reminded them of what they enjoyed about SVB. James\u2019 Zefr has not found a single bank that can offer every service he wants, so he is using one to borrow money and another for conventional accounts. He does not expect Zefr\u2019s growth to slow, but says his company \u201Cwill have to suffer worse terms or take on a bit more risk.\u201D\nGupta, who is chief technology officer of BonfireDAO, recalls how he was able to open an account with SVB entirely online while in Singapore at his previous startup a decade ago, an option he has not found as he now searches for SVB alternatives. \u201CThey were just the first one to really propose solutions,\u201D he says of his early interactions with SVB. \u201CI never shopped around again.\u201D\nHe wrote on LinkedIn last week that \u201Cmany startups like [his] have lost a valuable friend, partner, and source of support.\u201D He says his heart wants to stick with SVB if it resurrects, but he\u2019s no longer sure it\u2019s financially prudent to do so, no matter the constant aid, invaluable discounts, or occasional free conference room.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/641204b750a2c32c8d5d28a1\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Silicon-Valley-Shutdown-Business-1248000449.jpg","author":"BY PARESH DAVE","title":"How Silicon Valley Bank Became Startups\u2019 Best Friend","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/wine-skiing-and-loans-how-silicon-valley-bank-became-startups-best-friend\/","tags":["","FINANCE","VENTURE CAPITAL","STARTUPS","MONEY","CRYPTOCURRENCY"]},{"date":"02.10.2023","summary":"The famous label\u2019s new deal with a virtual band is being called \u201Cmetaverse music history in the making.\u201D I have questions.","post_content":"THE MONITOR IS a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63e58a6e552920ecdc857e60\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/The-Whales-Sign-With-Def-Jam-Culture.jpg","author":"BY ANGELA WATERCUTTER","title":"Def Jam Just Signed a Bunch of NFT Whales","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/def-jam-signs-nft-whales\/","tags":["","THE MONITOR","MUSIC","NFTS","METAVERSE"]},{"date":"12.15.2022","summary":"This week on Gadget Lab, we talk about the development of the Ledger Stax, a cryptocurrency wallet designed by Tony Fadell.","post_content":"EVEN IF YOU own no bitcoin, no ether, and no NFTs, crypto wallets\u2014pocket-friendly hardware lockers that store digital assets\u2014will be a part of your future.

I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We're also joined this week, once again, by WIRED editor at large Steven Levy. Steven, welcome back to the show.\nSteven Levy: Thank you. It was always a thrill to be on the show.\nLauren Goode: Steven, we have to tell you that as we were reading your latest feature and preparing for this show, Mike and I looked at each other and said, \u201CSteven's a really good writer.\u201D We knew that already, of course. But it was underscored. You really are. It's like you've been doing it for a while. A fantastic writer.\nSteven Levy: I think I have a pretty good lead on everyone else for the most features in WIRED magazine.\nLauren Goode: Incredible.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and I don't think I'm going to challenge you on that.\nLauren Goode: No, we're never going to catch up.\nMichael Calore: Well, Steven, your latest feature for WIRED is a story about cryptocurrency. Most of our listeners probably know at this point that we are in the midst of a crypto winter where the values of many digital currencies have fallen. Exchanges are under intense scrutiny. The NFT market has crashed, and the whole scene is going through a lot of difficult times. So this particular moment feels like the right time to step back and take a long-term look at the crypto world and think about where it might be going in the next few years. Now, one company thinking far into the future is Ledger. Steven just wrote a big story for WIRED about this company, a French business that sells cryptocurrency wallets. Ledger's newest wallet is called Stax. It's making waves primarily because it's designed by Tony Fadell, the guy behind the iPod and the iPhone and the Nest thermostat. Tony's a big deal. If Tony Fadell is making Ledger's next crypto wallet, then it'll get the attention of more than just the crypto bros. But let's start with some basics. Steven, can you please tell us what is a cryptocurrency wallet?Steven Levy: Right, OK. So the wallet we're talking about is something that holds not only cryptocurrency but other kinds of digital assets, which could range from NFTs to papers about your identity. Think of it as a tiny secure vault that holds your private key, which is sort of a stamp you make to authenticate that you are you. So when you have a crypto asset, whether it's a bitcoin or an NFT, it lives on this ledger called the blockchain. And your direct connection is that the owner of the digital asset is logged on this ledger. So the question is, how do you prove that it's you? How do you prove that you're the owner? And that's because there's a little key, which when you unlock it, it says, bam, it's you. And you have to hold this key in the tightest, most secure place, because anyone who has the key is automatically the owner. It's definitional: The person who has the key owns that asset. So the crypto wallet is a way where that power is literally in your hands, where you have this piece of hardware which holds that digital key very, very closely. And if it hasn't been hacked, so as you mentioned, that's very important. You can prove that those assets are yours.\nLauren Goode: How does this differ from using something like secure ID on an iPhone? Apple often talks about how secure it is to use something like face unlock and store your biometric info on their secure ID. Because that is something that the company does not have access to, and you're sort of holding that in your hand. How is this different?\nSteven Levy: Well, one thing I learned about studying crypto, and I actually wrote a book about it at one point, is that the amount of effort you put into protecting something pretty much has to be in sync with how important it is to protect it. So if it's very, very, very important, you need the most secure way to lock something down. And as it turns out, the phone is not the most secure way. There's companies that sell to other governments a way to hack it outright. And the biometrics like face recognition and fingerprints you use can be relatively easy to hack. They're public, people can see your face, they can fake it, they can get your fingerprint, they can cut your finger off. I just watched the movie about that, where some guy cut his finger off.\nLauren Goode: Let's put a pin in that and come back to it.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, it's not the most secure way to do things. So this company has put its bet on people saying, \u201CHey, if I'm going to have these digital assets that are so secure, I don't have to trust anyone in the world, any kind of institution or bank or anyone else, I want maximum security.\u201D And that can only come from something which is an unhackable way to protect your key.Michael Calore: So this company that you wrote about, Ledger, they make these cryptocurrency wallets. That's their primary business. Tell us more about Ledger.\nSteven Levy: So Ledger is a French company, which in 2014 began making these wallets. So not the only company that makes them, but they become the leader of the field. And right now they look like an old USB stick, the kind that had a jackknife sort of scheme where you put a metal sheath over it and flipped it open. And right now the passcode you use is in this tiny little microscopic display they have, and it isn't even a keypad. It's hard to use, but it's very, very secure. And I think something like 20 percent of the world's cryptocurrency is protected by Ledger wallets and maybe 30 percent of NFTs. So they're definitely one of the leading companies in the field. But still, it's pretty hard to use, it's something really reserved for the hardcore crypto crowd. So my story begins when the people at Ledger thought, \u201CGee, how can we open this up and appeal to an audience beyond the geeks, beyond the crypto bros, and make it so a wider swath of the population can adopt this technology?\u201D\nLauren Goode: So enter Tony Fadell. To be clear, he didn't found Ledger, but he got involved a little bit later because something was really irking him about the products. He was consulting, and then he ended up saying, \u201CLet's redesign the whole thing.\u201D Talk about that.\nSteven Levy: Even before Tony, there was another person named Ian Rogers who came to the company, and this guy's a fascinating guy. I mentioned that he had a lot of trophy jobs, but trophies they usually don't find in the same case. He was kind of a skateboard kid who took computer science and worked at Yahoo and headed Yahoo Music. And then he went to work for Beats and did their music software and then started Apple Music when Apple bought Beats. And then he became the head of these luxury fashion brands. And the CEO of Ledger, this guy named Pascal Gauthier, thought, \u201CI need Americans to market my product, because the French are too stodgy and I want to be a global company.\u201D So he tapped this guy Ian to come and work for him, but Ian had a friend in Paris who he said, \u201CCan you look into this for me?\u201D And that friend was Tony Fadell. And Tony, in doing due diligence, got excited about the prospect of rethinking the crypto wallet and agreed to do the redesign for a wallet. He didn't join the company; he got a little piece of the company, but he became the defacto design head and father of this new product called Stax.\nLauren Goode: And you mentioned earlier that some of the previous crypto wallets from Ledger, they had a tiny screen, they weren't super easy to unlock, and in your story you mentioned that the directions say, allow yourself 30 minutes to even set this thing up. And then in comes Mr. iPod, who reinvented the literal wheel. So what was his vision for this new wallet?Steven Levy: So he looked at this and he thought, \u201CGee, this is just like digital music was when I was charged to lead the iPod project from Steve Jobs.\u201D The first MP3 players were really clunky to use; it was hard to even pick out the single song you wanted to listen to. They were bulky, and they were definitely not cool and fun. So he said, \u201CI could do the same thing for wallets. Instead of having this tiny little display and no buttons, I could do a touchscreen. And what's more, I can make the touchscreen really cool in a credit-card-size device. Where this screen, and it's an E Ink screen, wraps around the side, and on the side you could read it like the spine of a book. And maybe you'll have a bunch of different assets in different categories that you could use together, and you could stack them up like a big pile of a hundred dollars bills.\u201D So they made them magnetic so they would snap in order. And you could put your NFTs on the display. They had a long battery life so you could put it in a drawer and it would be good for months. So he decided to make this thing easier to use and cooler, and sell it for a reasonable price and make it a more welcoming product for people considering getting into self custody for digital assets.\nMichael Calore: I think both Ian Rogers and Tony Fadell told you at some point in your reporting, and this is in the story, that they believed that what we're looking at right now is a moment that goes back to about 15 years ago. When most people believed that when the iPhone came out, that it wouldn't necessarily be a product for everybody. Not everybody is going to want a smartphone. That was obviously wrong. And Ian Rogers says that something similar is happening right now with cryptocurrency, where it doesn't really feel super vital to daily life for everyone at the moment. But that in the future, most humans will end up owning digital assets. I wonder if that's really true.\nSteven Levy: I think the long-term vision is valid. Ian said something really interesting to me. He said he attended a conference in New York recently, and it was a bunch of crypto people and you needed a crypto token to actually get in. It was your ticket. And he thought how weird it was that the technology he used to get into this party basically was more secure, more sophisticated, and easier to use than what you used to get into a country. I think eventually you can make the case that our passports will be digital assets and our driver's licenses and our Taylor Swift tickets. It'll be a long process. But I think it makes sense that somewhere down the line, I don't want to put how many years it's going to take, that this is going to be the way that we hold everything dear to us that can be digitized.Lauren Goode: As I was reading this story, that's exactly what I was thinking. I was wondering if it was eventually going to become more than just a crypto wallet. If it was going to store our passports and licenses and vaccine cards. Because as someone who loses things quite a bit, I was thinking, \u201COK, this thing is $249. I would probably spend that amount on a really secure digital wallet if it meant I wasn't replacing all the other things I lose throughout the year.\u201D\nMichael Calore: And just don't lose your wallet.\nSteven Levy: But definitely, I think that's it. Now, they don't have a clear roadmap on how to make this happen in two years. And Ian actually said to me, \u201CI'm a little wary that we're going to be like the Nokia or Blackberry of this space.\u201D Because they're there now, and maybe down the road someone will come up. But right now their hope is to build this big head start, and since they're already the most popular product in this pre-cool-device era of wallets, yhey're hoping they can just put the stake in the ground, and as this happens, they will be the platform that people use for these other digital assets.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, let's take a quick break and we'll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right, welcome back. Now obviously, when Ledger first started planning the Stax release and got Fadell involved to build it, the crypto world was doing OK, and then a lot of cryptocurrencies tumbled in value. The NFT market crashed, and now the FTX Exchange is the target of a fraud investigation. And the whole crypto world seems to be in a pretty serious crisis. Some people might point to all of the recent news and say, \u201CWow, lousy timing for Ledger to release this wallet.\u201D But others like Fadell and his team would say, \u201CNo, this is actually perfect timing.\u201D\nSteven Levy: That's right. It is been a challenging year for crypto in general, but not disastrous. At the time, I went to Paris and had to suffer my way through the City of Lights while reporting the story. A couple weeks later, the team came to New York, and during that period we learned about FTX and SBF, and the whole crypto market just collapsed and was shrouded in doubt and fear and loathing. So when I brought this up to them, they said, \u201CWell, we're the solution.\u201D And they noted to me, and we had discussed this before, then when your money is in a crypto exchange like FTX, it's the same principle as a bank. If you have money in a bank, they don't earmark your dollars with your name on it in a red marker. They just put it in a big pile. And if everyone wants it all at once, they have to have enough money to pay people back. If they don't, it's a big trouble. As Samuel Bankman-Fried learned, and we all learned from FTX, with self custody, it doesn't work that way. The money is actually earmarked for you and linked to your little private key. So that could not happen if your money was protected by self-custody and a crypto wallet. The question is how successful the whole market is going to be. Whether this casts a big enough shadow on the whole crypto market that people are going to ignore it. I said, \u201CIs this going to be introducing a great cocktail on the Titanic just before it hits the iceberg?\u201DLauren Goode: So wait a second. If someone had, let's say, made an investment that was tied to Sam Bankman-Fried's coin FTT, or let's say they invested directly in the FTT coin, and it was stored on a ledger wallet. Then if the value of that coin goes down significantly, how does having it on a ledger wallet, a hard wallet make it any different than just having it stored in an exchange or having a record of it on an exchange?\nSteven Levy: Well, if the currency itself is worthless, you're right. But if you are trying to get your assets, a lot of people had their money not in the magic beans that SPF invented, but in bitcoin and ether and other markers of value that still have some value. If they have their money in there, and they couldn't get it out, they couldn't get it paid back. So if money is involved in a currency which is worth something, you could recover it. In this case, there was real money that disappeared. They said, \u201COh, there's a line in the spreadsheet for 8 billion that we forgot about.\u201D Kind of like, \u201CThere's one little line, and if you want your money back, sorry, we can't deliver that because this line in the spreadsheet disappeared.\u201D And if you buy an NFT, at the least you want to say that my ownership in this NFT is verified. And I don't have to trust anyone else to be able to claim what I purchased.\nLauren Goode: I think I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the idea of a hard wallet and what it points to if you were to use an analog to a current banking app. When I use authentication on my iPhone to get into my current banking app, I don't believe that what I'm looking at is the actual repository of dollars. I'm looking at a digital representation of dollars that are stored somewhere else. With the hard wallet, it's another form of identity verification, and it's holding the keys that point to assets that are somewhere else.\nSteven Levy: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Am I understanding that? It's not like you're looking at the NFT itself on this little wallet.\nSteven Levy: The difference is that with your bank, there's a third party involved that you have to trust. If your bank goes bust, you might have had a thousand dollars in that bank, but you're not getting that thousand dollars. This is more like saying, \u201CI have a thousand dollars in a safety deposit in this bank, the bank went broke, but I still have access to the safe deposit box.\u201D\nMichael Calore: That's a good analogy. I think the idea of a cryptocurrency wallet saves us from some of the abstraction that's involved when thinking about exchanges. Because it's a physical token that you hold in your hand that you can manipulate via the touchscreen if you have a Stax. And it's not something that sort of exists in the sky that you access through a browser. So I do think that eliminating that abstraction of dealing with exchanges is helpful for the cryptocurrency market. Because it gives something that people who are less familiar with it or who still find it confusing and weirdly obfuscated, it gives them something to literally hold on to, literally and figuratively hold on to. And I know that that was Fadell and Roger's goal in building this wallet, making something that was even more accessible to get people into wallets. And I think maybe the real hump they have to get over is not giving people something that they can use to help them understand cryptocurrency. But giving them something that they can use to help them understand the difference between a physical wallet and an exchange.Steven Levy: And the idea is, and I didn't really realize this until I did the story, is that the word trust is a pejorative in this world. The idea that you have to trust someone is anathema to the true crypto people. They don't want trustworthy places to deal with, because that implies that you have to extend trust. They want trust-proof systems where you don't have to rely on anyone, no matter how trustworthy they look. So again, it muddies the conversation to limit it to talk about cryptocurrencies, because as Lauren pointed out, cryptocurrencies might go bust. It's more to say digital assets, digital identity markers that are going to be protected in your digital vault. Because these things are emblazoned on the ledger that there's many copies of, and you can't forge it. And then you have the direct connection with your private key and that you don't really do other kinds of manipulation with this wallet. It's almost like in medieval times, they had a seal, and you had your own personal seal that you would stamp it with to verify it's you. This is a much more secure, high-tech version of that. You don't need to trust anyone. I mentioned Taylor Swift tickets\u2014they're super, super valuable. If you want a non-forgeable Taylor Swift ticket, this would be the way to do it. You wouldn't have to trust a scalper, you wouldn't have to trust Ticketmaster. That would be your proof that you're the owner of a general admission ticket to see Taylor Swift.\nLauren Goode: Steven, before we go, I have to ask you, have you purchased a Ledger Stax wallet, and are you investing in crypto?\nSteven Levy: Well, I don't have the new one yet. They did send me the current version to test out, and I managed to get it going. But I actually came down with Covid before I actually wanted to confer with their people, before I moved my wealth of crypto assets over to it. I wrote about this, I do own some crypto because in 2014 I went to a demo of a bitcoin ATM and put $20 in and at one point it got to be a lot of money. But now it's still worth over a thousand dollars.\nLauren Goode: Nice.\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nSteven Levy: Which I thought was ironic, because all these investors were going to this Y Combinator Demo Day figuring out which company would be a return on their investment. And they just should have funneled a lot of money into that ATM machine, they would've done better.\nLauren Goode: But what I'm hearing you say is that, and by the way, we're sorry that you were dealing with Covid, and we're glad that you're better and back on the show. But it sounds like you are waiting for something to move those crypto assets onto this new wallet. Does that mean you don't fully trust it?Steven Levy: I don't trust myself to do it correctly. And this is the one scary part about wallets, is ultimately the responsibility is yours. If someone gets your passcode and the passcode for these wallets \u2026 the way the private key is generated, I think like 26 different words that you have to write down. And if you lose that, and if someone else comes across it, they can basically claim your assets. So it's up to you to protect your password for that private key. And if you screw up, it's gone.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Well don't screw up.\nSteven Levy: Yeah. Well, yeah. I don't want to lose my fortune in bitcoin.\nMichael Calore: All right, let's take another break, and when we come back we'll do recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: OK. Steven Levy, you are our guest. So please tell us, what do you recommend to our listeners that they check out.\nSteven Levy: Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: Paxlovid?\nSteven Levy: Yes. It's this medicine, this drug that is an option to take, and you get it free, the government pays for it actually. If you've come down with Covid and you do it in the first five days of symptoms, it can lessen the symptoms by maybe a couple days. And cut the odds if you've been vaccinated, they're already pretty low, but further cut them, that serious bad things will happen. The drawback is that it tastes very bad. And in my newsletter I did some tasting notes and I said, \u201CThere's a bouquet of a porta potty and an underfunded jam band concert.\u201D And other kinds of things. To me, because I had some very uncomfortable flu-like symptoms to cut a couple days out of, that was worth it. So I recommend Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: That's great. And I know that if you have symptoms and you're worried that you might have Covid, and you go to get tested at a facility like a hospital or a public testing site or the local library or your doctor's office, they will ask you if you are you interested in receiving Paxlovid. And they'll give it to you if you do test positive.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, it's very easy to get. Originally when they first came out, it was tough to get. Now it's super easy. Basically, my doctor, who I had a telemedicine appointment with, went over with it, and actually he was sort of on the fence. Because some people reported you get a bounce back, so you have to sort of crunch some numbers. Supposedly it lessens the odds you'll get long Covid. But I weighed all the factors and decided to get it. And my pharmacy delivered it within an hour from there. So I took the five days of Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: And you can taste things again now.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, yeah. I never lost my sense of taste, but I was hyper aware of the taste of Paxlovid.Lauren Goode: Once again, Steven, we're very glad that you have recovered.\nSteven Levy: Well, thank you.\nMichael Calore: Indeed. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is going to seem rather nonessential compared to Steven's. But if you happen to be, oh, I don't know, staying home with Covid and you're looking for something to watch, I recommend White Lotus season two. I recommended this earlier this year when I first started watching it. Now the season has wrapped up. It's an incredible series; check it out. Don't go on Instagram if you don't want it spoiled for you. If you don't want to know who dies. I recommend staying away from Evan Ross Katz's profile in particular, because he screenshots a lot of memes from the show. He's hilarious. But yeah, White Lotus season two, just to follow up on that one. And then my actual recommendation this week is related to our podcast producer, Boone Ashworth, because Boone uses these amazing pens. They're by the brand Zebra, they're called the Sarasa, what are they called?\nMichael Calore: Sarasa Grand.\nLauren Goode: Sarasa Grand, they're these amazing gel weighted pens. And our pod here, not our podcast pod, but our pod at work here, we sometimes exchange some holiday gifts. And Boone, after I raved about his pen the other day, he was kind enough to get me a gift set of the Zebra Sarasa Grand pens, and they're awesome. So thank you, Boone. And if you're looking for a good pen or a nice little gift set to give to someone who likes pens, I recommend these.\nMichael Calore: Lauren says we sometimes exchange gifts because some of us have exchanged gifts, but I being the cad and forgetting that most people are not going to be around next week, I haven't gotten anybody gifts yet. So hang tight you all.\nLauren Goode: It's OK. Your presence is a gift.\nMichael Calore: No, yeah, it is. But also I do have things in mind that I'm going to get you. So please hold for those. I appreciate it.\nLauren Goode: And Mike, what's your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: OK. My recommendation is on-topic for this week, because last week I was going through our storage closet here at work, and I found a Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin Air, which was the big sort of dooby-shaped black speaker that you put an iPod on. And it has a 30-pin connector on top of it. So it's like an iPod dock, but it's amazing. It sounds wonderful. I think it was a thousand dollars when it came out. So I went further into the closet, and I found my old iPod, and I charged it up and I put it on that thing. And I spent two days just listening to my iPod. And I have to say, owning music and listening to music that you own on a device that is not connected to the internet just feels different. There's something about it. There's something that is sort of like you are settling for what's in your library and not constantly poking around for something else to listen to. There is nothing else to listen to. You have very limited choice, and it really helps you make focused decisions about what you're listening to. So I'm the type of person who fills as many minutes of my day with music as I can, at work, while I'm walking around, at home, while I'm in the kitchen. Even when I'm going to sleep, I listen to music. So having this iPod and having a limited choice of things to listen to has made me revisit a bunch of albums that I normally would not pick if I was just surfing Spotify. So if you have an iPod and you haven't listened to it in a while, bust it out, because there's all kinds of great music on there that you actually own.Steven Levy: Well, here's the thing. I have an iPod Classic, the last one with a good hard drive. And I'm terrified that it's going to die, because when it dies, you can't replace it. So I love to listen to that iPod on a plane ride where I can shuffle my whole collection. But I have to judge whether the trip is going to be worth it to take it, and spend some more time in what is ultimately a limited amount of life left in this pod. So the question is, is this trip iPod-worthy, in the sense that in Seinfeld, Elaine had the sponge-worthy metric on whether she wanted to use a certain kind of contraceptive. So I'm constantly thinking, \"Gee, do I want to listen to music enough to pull out my great clickwheel iPod? Is this iPod-worthy?\"\nMichael Calore: Well, I'll say two things. One, that you can still get iPods. You can buy them on the internet, you can refurbish them, you can get a tool kit and get a hard drive and pop them open and replace the hard drive inside of them. If the hard drive dies, of course, you have to refill it with music, but you can still plug a USB cable somehow into your computer and refill it with music if you have to. So I wouldn't worry so much about losing that particular piece of hardware, because the hardware still for the next few years anyway, will be replaceable. The second thing I'll say is, ride it into the ground. Absolutely. Break that thing. Listen to it so much that it falls apart.\nSteven Levy: Well, after Covid it's all carpe diem for me. So I guess I'll take your advice.\nLauren Goode: There was a period of time when I was using this little waterproofed iPod. What was it, the Nano?\nMichael Calore: The Nano.\nLauren Goode: The one that doesn't have any screen, just the clickwheel.\nMichael Calore: Oh, that's the Shuffle.\nLauren Goode: The Shuffle.\nMichael Calore: The first Shuffle.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I found this company, I wrote about them at one of my previous jobs. This company, I want to say they were in, I don't remember where they were, Oregon maybe, Washington state. And it was just a father-and-son team who would buy these iPod Shuffles in bulk, and then they would waterproof them, and they were for swimming. And they were great. I bought these little waterproof headphones, I clipped the iPod Shuffle to the strap of my bathing suit. And I would listen to music as I was swimming laps. I loved it.\nMichael Calore: That's great.\nLauren Goode: Loved it. And then eventually, I think it just, no matter how well you waterproof it, it got corroded, because it was really not designed to be underwater. Pretty cool though. That's the last one I used.\nMichael Calore: Oh, that's great. All right, well that is our show for this week. Steven, thank you again for joining us.\nSteven Levy: It was all I hoped for. Thank you.\nMichael Calore: And we're glad that you're feeling better. It's good to see you.\nSteven Levy: Thank you.\nMichael Calore: And thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter, still there. Just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth, and we will be back next week. Goodbye.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/639a7a0d51401b7ec2ec5f7c\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Ledger-Stax-Gadget-Lab-Podcast-Gear.jpg","author":"BY WIRED STAFF","title":"You\u2019re Gonna Need a Crypto Wallet","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/gadget-lab-podcast-578\/","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","WALLETS"]},{"date":"07.21.2023","summary":"Attempts by the US and UK to require backdoors in secure messaging apps are a huge step in the wrong direction.

The feeling in crypto circles now, says Nicholas Rees, cofounder of Bahamas-based payments firm Kanoo Pays, is of \u201Ccomplete and utter shock.\u201D\nAs other senior FTX employees fled the country, they were replaced by a throng of reporters and crypto influencers heading in the opposite direction, hoping to locate the disgraced crypto wunderkind.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nBankman-Fried was ultimately arrested at his $40 million penthouse by Bahamian police on December 12 under the instruction of US law enforcement. He has since been extradited to the US, and on January 3 pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and commodities fraud.\nWhile Bankman-Fried awaits his trial, penciled for October 2023, members of the Bahamas\u2019 crypto scene are left to pick up the pieces, their reputations impacted by proximity.\nBy virtue of its size and standing, says Rees, FTX\u2019s tendrils extended into many corners of Nassau, the capital city\u2014whether through charitable donations, corporate deals, or events that brought custom to the doors of local businesses. The crypto exchange also cohosted an invite-only conference in July last year, boasting a roster of speakers that included Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and football player Tom Brady.\nThe Kanoo Innovation Hub, a startup accelerator launched by Kanoo Pays, was mere days away from announcing a partnership with FTX when the scandal broke. Rees claims FTX intended to create a way for accelerator participants to tap into the $100 million pool of capital already set aside for local investments. (FTX did not respond to a request for confirmation of the agreement.)Although the survival of the Innovation Hub is not contingent on FTX funding, Rees says the collaboration promised to take the scheme \u201Cto another level,\u201D providing a leg up to founders from the Caribbean.\nWorse, Rees explains, the collapse of FTX created an employment vacuum that deprived Bahamians of both their current jobs and potential career opportunities. \u201CThe saddest part for us, outside the millions of people that lost money,\u201D he says, \u201Cis that some of our countrymen would have received the job of a lifetime, but it was pulled out from under them.\u201D\nAlthough groups of crypto enthusiasts already existed, the Bahamas began to formally establish itself as a crypto hub in late 2020 with the passing of the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Act.\nAt the time, it was among the only pieces of fully-fledged crypto legislation worldwide, says Caroline Malcolm, head of international public policy at blockchain data firm Chainalysis. It  established a clear set of rules for crypto companies, unavailable in most other jurisdictions, and ensured businesses that engaged in malpractice could be held to account. \nIn the two years since, a collection of startups and large crypto companies have set up shop in the Bahamas, among them FTX and OKX, another large crypto exchange. Separately, Tether, whose dollar-pegged stablecoin is central to the smooth operation of crypto markets, holds its reserves with a Bahamian bank, Deltec Bank & Trust.\nBut already, signs of damage dealt by the FTX collapse to the Bahamas\u2019 status as an emerging crypto capital are beginning to show.\nIn December, SALT, the events company led by former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, announced the cancellation of Crypto Bahamas 2023. Another event, D3 Bahamas, run by the Bahamas government and billed as the country\u2019s \u201Cflagship Web3 and financial technology festival,\u201D was due to take place this January, but has been postponed. A new date has not yet been set.\nCarlyle Bethel, founder of real estate tokenization startup Akerage, was due to pitch for venture capital funding at D3 and describes the postponement as \u201Cdisheartening.\u201D His chief concern is that the FTX collapse has \u201Cshaken potential investors,\u201D making it more difficult for startups like his to bring onboard the funding they need to scale.\nAs for other global crypto businesses with ties to the Bahamas, the response has been mixed. Tether is unmoved; Paolo Ardoino, CTO, says the FTX situation is in no way a reflection of the Bahamas and that Tether is \u201Cstrongly considering\u201D opening an office there. OKX, however, declined to answer questions about its commitment to the country.\nNassau is also home to a growing brigade of crypto startups, like oceanfront coworking space Crypto Isle, which aims to bring together isolated groups of entrepreneurs and \u201Ccreate a space for people to learn about crypto,\u201D says cofounder Davinia Bain. \nOther startups work alongside the Caribbean Blockchain Alliance, an NGO that advocates for the adoption of blockchain technology in the region. Stefen Deleveaux, president of the organization, describes the crypto scene in the Bahamas as \u201Csmall, but active and growing.\u201DNeither Bain nor Deleveaux expressed particular concern about the knock-on effects FTX could have on local crypto businesses. With the exception of a few companies that were anticipating direct funding from FTX\u2019s venture capital division, Bain says \u201Cthe mood at Crypto Isle hasn\u2019t changed.\u201D Deleveaux points to the \u201Cmassive potential\u201D of the local grassroots crypto movement, which is \u201Cquite ready to move on\u201D from FTX.\nOthers see things slightly differently, though. Although Rees is confident in the quality of Bahamian crypto startups, he says the collapse of FTX is \u201Cnot good for the industry.\u201D\nSpecifically, he is concerned that people typically fail to distinguish between the actions of a company (or handful of individuals within a company) and the industry and nation in which it operates. As a result, crypto companies in the Bahamas face a tarring\u2014even firms like Kanoo Pays, which deals predominantly in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the antithesis of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nIn the two months since FTX collapsed, the Bahamas\u2019 willful embrace of crypto has come under the microscope, along with its approach to regulating the industry. And Philip Davis, prime minister of the Bahamas, has had to come out on the defensive.\nNew crypto regulations under the DARE Act had been proposed long before the FTX allegations emerged. A report published in April 2022 by the Bahamian government set out a \u201Cvision\u201D for capitalizing further on the \u201Cremarkable opportunity\u201D presented by digital assets. But framed by the FTX debacle, it makes for difficult reading.\nThe plan, which included provisions relating to crypto trends like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi), promised to cement the country\u2019s reputation as a \u201Cleading digital asset hub,\u201D the report asserted\u2014but also to ensure that \u201Conly well-run, trustworthy, and thriving digital asset businesses, which are able to \u2026 sustain the good reputation of The Bahamas, are allowed to operate from the country.\u201D Ouch.\nThe Bahamas Securities Commission, which consulted on the report, declined to comment on how the FTX collapse might inform regulatory reform. The office of the prime minister did not return requests for comment.\nBut Malcolm says DARE cannot have enabled the alleged FTX fraud, which is covered off by provisions that require businesses to \u201Cmaintain adequate controls, safeguard investor assets, [and] maintain adequate financial resources.\u201D She describes the idea as \u201Ca massive mischaracterization\u201D that paints an unfair picture of the Bahamas.\nBain also takes issue with the light in which the country has been cast by the media. Although the FTX debacle has dealt a heavy blow to the global cryptocurrency industry, she says the specific impact on the Bahamas has been \u201Coverblown\u201D: \u201CThis idea that FTX has left a gaping hole in our economy or the fabric of our society\u2014it\u2019s just not true.\u201D\nIf any country is equipped to recover from a reputational setback of this kind, says Rees, it\u2019s his own. To the extent that any nation can have a single worldview, Rees claims the Bahamas\u2019 is one of relentless optimism. \u201CThe Bahamas is the Bahamas,\u201D he says. \u201CWe were here yesterday, and we\u2019ll be here tomorrow.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63bded02145a571e203e3b47\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business-crypto-collapse-bahamas.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"FTX Has Wrecked the Crypto Party in Paradise","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/bahamas-ftx-crypto-party\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BITCOIN","FINANCE","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]},{"date":"01.26.2023","summary":"The crypto money-laundering market is tighter than at any time in the past decade, and the few big players are moving a \u201Cshocking\u201D amount of currency. ","post_content":"FOR YEARS, THE cryptocurrency economy has been rife with black market sales, theft, ransomware, and money laundering\u2014despite the strange fact that in that economy, practically every transaction is written into a blockchain\u2019s permanent, unchangeable ledger. But new evidence suggests that years of advancements in blockchain tracing and crackdowns on that illicit underworld may be having an effect\u2014if not reducing the overall volume of crime, then at least cutting down on the number of laundering outlets, leaving the crypto black market with fewer options to cash out its proceeds than it\u2019s had in a decade.\nIn a portion of its annual crime report focused on money laundering that was published today, cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis points to a new consolidation in crypto criminal cash-out services over the past year. It counted just 915 of those services used in 2022, the fewest it\u2019s seen since 2012 and the latest sign of a steady drop-off in the number of those services since 2018. Chainalysis says an even smaller number of exchanges now enable the money-laundering trade of cryptocurrency for actual dollars, euros, and yen: It found that just five cryptocurrency exchanges now handle nearly 68 percent of all black market cash-outs. \nIn fact, Chainalysis saw just 542 cryptocurrency deposit addresses receive more than half of the $6.3 billion in total illicit funds it tracked to those cash-out services in 2022, and just four addresses received $1.1 billion of those funds.\nThat intense narrowing of so-called \u201Coff-ramps\u201D for crypto crime is a result of an ongoing government crackdown on crypto money laundering and a sign of additional enforcement on the way, says Kim Grauer, Chainalysis\u2019 director of research. \u201CIt\u2019s shocking to see some of these deposit addresses moving more than a hundred million dollars in illicit funds and still operating when it\u2019s something that\u2019s extremely transparent and easy to see with blockchain analytics,\u201D Grauer says. \u201CSo it does seem like a good chokepoint, where we can shut down and profile and\u2014to some degree\u2014eradicate this activity.\u201D\nWhether the overall amount of crypto crime rose or fell in 2022, meanwhile, is far from clear: By some measures, Chainalysis\u2019 data has shown that criminal use of cryptocurrency increased last year despite the steep decline in cryptocurrency exchange rates. But those numbers include a huge spike in illegal transactions at sanctioned cryptocurrency exchanges\u2014which may have less to do with a rise in crime than with the US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) increasingly imposing those sanctions on major players in the crypto underground. In April of last year, for instance, OFAC sanctioned Garantex, an exchange based in Russia that it says laundered over $100 million in criminal proceeds, including ransomware payments. The year before, it sanctioned two other Russian exchanges, Chatex and Suex, which have since gone out of business. And just last week, OFAC sanctioned another exchange, Bitzlato, and the Justice Department indicted its Russian founder, Anatoly Legkodymov, and tore his operation offline.\n\u201CYou don\u2019t carry out a ransomware attack if there\u2019s no way of converting that ransom into something usable,\u201D says Grauer. \u201CWhat we\u2019re really seeing OFAC doing, and what we\u2019ve really highlighted, is that the money-laundering off-ramps are what\u2019s facilitating crime. And I think the ongoing crackdown has shown that people understand they\u2019re at a point where there can be meaningful intervention.\u201DChainalysis declined to name the five exchanges it says enabled the majority of cryptocurrency money laundering. That\u2019s because, the company says, those exchanges may be the targets of ongoing investigations. (Chainalysis often works with law enforcement agencies in those investigations.) Further, the exchanges may not actually be aware that they\u2019re enabling that money laundering, since money launderers often take pains to hide the source of their funds before it hits an exchange.\nIn fact, Chainalysis found that a large chunk of the illicit cash-outs went through two types of intermediaries that might obfuscate criminal funds: Many were traded through \u201Cnested services,\u201D essentially exchanges that appear to be independent but actually use a larger exchange to carry out their trades. In those cases, the nested service, rather than the underlying exchange, is often responsible for complying with \u201Cknow-your-customer\u201D requirements, even as the larger exchange provides the cash reserves for transactions. \nIn another growing subset of cases, Chainalysis says, criminals are turning to individual dark-web-based money-laundering services, many of which offer to hide the origin of funds by combining them with other users\u2019 transactions in a \u201Cmixer.\u201D As law enforcement has cracked down on major mixing services in recent years\u2014seizing and tearing offline the mixers Bitcoin Fog and Helix and sanctioning the mixing service Tornado Cash, for instance\u2014more criminals have turned to smaller dark-web services that Chainalysis\u2019 Grauer refers to as \u201Cmom-and-pop\u201D mixers, whose distributed nature makes them harder to seize or disrupt.\nDespite its reluctance to name the top five money-laundering exchanges in its most recent report, in another report in February of last year Chainalysis did point to a collection of Russia-based exchanges it says have cashed out large sums of criminal proceeds. While some of the exchanges named in that report have since been sanctioned or gone offline, others\u2014including Cashbank and TETChange\u2014appear to still be active.\nWhen WIRED reached out to the US Treasury, an official there declined to comment on any specific exchanges or ongoing investigations. The official, who asked to remain unnamed due to the sensitive nature of sanctions policies that are coordinated between multiple government agencies, also suggested that Chainalysis\u2019 data offered only one incomplete perspective on the crypto money-laundering landscape and that much of the consolidation it describes might simply be due to 2022\u2019s crypto crash and the resulting bankruptcy of several exchanges\u2014particularly more \u201Cfly-by-night\u201D ones with looser compliance rules.\nBut the official also pointed to the Treasury\u2019s own enforcement efforts\u2014along with those of international partners\u2014as an ongoing crackdown that has intentionally reduced options for criminals. \u201CThe way you get at money laundering on a broad scale is you slowly whittle down the number of open vulnerabilities. Little by little you make the gaps fewer and fewer, smaller and smaller,\u201D the official says. \u201CIf you close up more gaps in the dam, more water flows through those open holes.\u201D\nAs gradual as that process may be, Chainalysis\u2019 Grauer says it\u2019s a sign that efforts to trace and disrupt the crypto criminal world\u2019s ATMs are slowly but surely having their intended effect. \u201CWe\u2019ve worked to show where the money-laundering gaps are. There are gaps that remain,\u201D says Grauer. \u201CThe crackdown is in progress.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63d2a2e5de734741c2ad3ceb\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/crypto_laundering_GettyImages-1349088550.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Most Criminal Cryptocurrency Funnels Through Just 5 Exchanges","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/cryptocurrency-money-laundering-chainalysis-report\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","DARK WEB","CRYPTOCURRENCY","RANSOMWARE","CRIME"]},{"date":"11.10.2022","summary":"One of the world\u2019s biggest crypto groups just voted to back its enigmatic founder.

But while Trump headlines flood your feeds, there were plenty of other big stories this week, none of which have anything to do with any of that. \nIn Germany, police are cracking down on people who post adult content to websites and platforms that lack age-verification checks, like Twitter. This has resulted in fines and threats of jail time, while some performers are deleting their accounts\u2014or fleeing the country. This is just one of the impacts of a wave of age-verification laws sweeping the global internet.\nMeanwhile, in darker corners of the internet, North Korea\u2013backed hackers are using a rare technique to launder their stolen cryptocurrencies: paying to mine clean crypto with loot taken from their victims. The tactic is meant to throw blockchain detectives off the trail of swiped funds. Speaking of ill-gotten gains, Costa Rica is still reeling from a series of ransomware attacks last spring that left swaths of the country's infrastructure devastated.

But documents leaked by a whistleblower inside a Russian intelligence contractor seem to reveal some new and alarming pages of the Kremlin\u2019s hybrid war playbook.\nA consortium of investigative journalists at 11 news outlets including Paper Trail Media, The Guardian, and The Washington Post obtained a leak of secret documents from a Russian cybersecurity contractor firm called Vulkan, the Russian word for volcano. The documents, which were also analyzed by cybersecurity firm Mandiant, reveal that Vulkan sold software tools to Russian intelligence agencies like the KGB-successor FSB and the GRU military intelligence agency, including its notorious cyberattack-focused team known as Sandworm. The tools include one piece of software for scanning the internet for security vulnerabilities and another that seemed designed to organize disinformation campaigns and coordinate offensive hacking operations. Perhaps most disturbing of all was a proposal for a third tool that appeared to be designed to allow hackers to train in simulated networks of infrastructure systems like railways and pipelines, with specific references to methods to sabotage those systems with catastrophic effects. But it\u2019s not clear whether that last tool was ever built, and if so, whether it was used primarily for offensive hacking or \u201Cred team\u201D defensive training, or whether it led to the development of any actual hacking capabilities targeting critical infrastructure.\nMajor Supply Chain Attack Targets Users of 3CX for Mac and Windows\nSecurity experts say North Korea\u2013linked hackers have successfully carried out a supply chain attack through compromised versions of 3CX, a video and voice communications platform used by high-profile companies including American Express and Mercedes-Benz. 3CX says it has more than 600,000 customers. The hackers were able to install malware within the Mac and Windows versions of 3CX, which were signed with the company's keys, thus allowing the Trojanized apps to go undetected. The attack is being compared to Russian hackers' SolarWinds supply chain attack, which wrought havoc around the world for months. \nExecutive Order Bans US Agencies From Buying Commercial Spyware\nAs hacker-for-hire firms' tools proliferate to governments around the world, the Biden administration has made clear: The US will not be one of that industry's customers. A new executive order bans US agencies from buying access to that commercial spyware, a key step in a growing effort to curb companies like NSO Group, Cytrox, and Candiru, which have enabled surveillance and human rights abuses from Spain to Mexico to Saudi Arabia. US agencies haven't been confirmed to be past customers of any of those companies, though the FBI did at one point test NSO's Phantom spyware before ultimately walking away from a deal with the company. But the order nonetheless sets a precedent for governments worldwide, assuring that US taxpayer funds won't flow to a dangerous industry whose tools have offered intrusive hacking techniques to repressive regimes targeting activists, journalists, and human rights defenders.\nExxon Critics Hacked by Indian Spy Firm\nWhile we're on the subject of dangerous hacker-for-hire firms targeting vulnerable activists: The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Indian hacker-for-hire firm BellTroX targeted climate change activists campaigning against Exxon, including Greenpeace, Public Citizen, 350.org, and the Rockefeller Family Fund. The firm was hired by Israeli private detective Aviram Azari, who has since pleaded guilty to hacking conspiracy charges. Exactly who hired Azari remains unclear, and Exxon denies having any connection to Azari or the hacking campaign. The hackers successfully accessed email accounts for Greenpeace, Public Citizen, and 350.org, but it's not yet clear whether they successfully penetrated the Rockefeller Family Fund, an organization created by Rockefeller heirs that has worked to combat the oil industry's efforts to lobby against climate change solutions.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6427186d4d1b8856e8647eee\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Security-News-This-Week--Major-Leak-Exposes-Russia's-Cyberwar-Tactics-Security-GettyImages-1245905982.jpg","author":"BY ANDREW COUTS","title":"\u2018Vulkan\u2019 Leak Offers a Peek at Russia\u2019s Cyberwar Playbook","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/vulkan-files-russia-security-roundup\/","tags":["","SECURITY ROUNDUP","CYBERSECURITY","HACKING","MALWARE"]},{"date":"02.10.2023","summary":"The world\u2019s most prolific crypto thieves have used Sinbad.io to launder tens of millions.

It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.","post_content":"ELON MUSK\u2019S ACQUISITION of Twitter is particularly hard to swallow because every report of internal chaos reminds us that we may have sacrificed the most promising mode of online communication invented in decades by failing to identify it for what it was back when we had the chance. Musk\u2019s purchase should never have been possible in the first place because Twitter should never have been an asset. It is \u201Cthe public conversation layer of the internet,\u201D as founder Jack Dorsey once put it, and consequently has functioned as the de facto center of our global alert system through the pandemic. It is astonishing that it is even still possible for one person to own this. It\u2019s like owning email.\nIn the field of information security, there\u2019s a kind of vulnerability known as the evil maid attack whereby an untrusted party gains physical access to important hardware, such as the housekeeping staff coming into your hotel room when you\u2019ve left your laptop unattended, thereby compromising it. We have here a new analog, just as capable of wrecking systems and leaking data. Call it the \u201Cevil billionaire attack\u201D if you\u2019d like. The weapon is money, and more specifically, the likelihood that when the moment arrives you won\u2019t have enough of it to make a difference. The call is coming from inside the house.  \nThe reason this strategy works is that most ideas of any consequence are owned by people with more money than you, and then whenever possible they string them together into a network with the specific intent of making the gravity inescapable. Founders and investors and excitable technology writers like myself frequently use the term \u201Cplatform\u201D to describe technical systems with granular components that can be used to compose new functionality, and the power sources propelling the technology industry find platforms particularly appealing when the bits can be monetized each time they are used.\nSUBSCRIBE\nSubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\nA platform is better than an app, or so the theory goes, because you can use a platform to build multiple apps, or enable other developers and companies to build apps from which you might take a 30 percent cut. Whatever its advantages, the Twitter debacle should spell the end of the proprietary platform as a serious technical undertaking, a high profile illustration that they are too risky to trust no matter how strong the code might be. The overly conservative approach to intellectual property that makes things proprietary in the first place is also a liability that compromises everything a company might create because it empowers billionaires to kill them. Whether or not he actually destroys it, Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter is a case study in how to destroy something, a model for the next billionaire who fancies a social media empire. Our communication channel for the next vaccine we might need is now at risk.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way, because there is already another platform out there. You just have to know where to look.\nBlockchains fight this problem on the deepest level possible. It would be vastly more difficult, or perhaps impossible, for Musk to kill off a blockchain so long as a handful of users objected enough to continue operating independent nodes. Duplicating across many computers means the risk of losing access is infinitesimal; the blockchain is its own API. This comes with different complications, of course, but losing information outright due to a hostile party is not one of them. For example, when the Hic et Nunc marketplace for NFTs went under in late 2021, another version relaunched, putting a new wrapper around the same content. The blockchain acts as a shared resource that forces interoperability, almost like organic self-defense.\nOr consider the case of WordPress, the early blogging engine that has since grown into increasingly elaborate general-purpose content management software. It now powers about 40 percent of the open web, with which it is loosely synonymous. A huge economy has sprung up around it: companies that develop websites, developers who work for those companies, indie developers who work for themselves, many of them writing plugins which can be unlocked or extended with licensing fees. This is all possible because the core is open source and encourages the same of its ecosystem. WordPress has been around for a long time and its straightforward RSS feeds decisively lost out to Twitter\u2019s social features, so in 2022 there is a reasonable argument that it is a bit long in the tooth. But we must now understand it to be a bigger technical success than Twitter, simply because it is not at risk.The rest of the web is even more bulletproof than WordPress because it is a suite of robust open protocols that can never be owned. Computers could not communicate at all without shared models, such as HTTP, FTP, and TCP\/IP. The internet was built out of interoperability\u2014even the parts we now think of as closed. There was a time not long ago when that was the whole point of building these things.\nInteroperability can be immediately rendered useless if half of the handshake is disappeared, so the next requirement is that you have to keep it all online. The brief chaotic saga of \u201Cleft-pad\u201D turned this into a high-profile lesson for developers. Most JavaScript code of any particular consequence makes its way to a code hosting service called npm, which makes it available for other developers to import and reuse. In 2016, an engineer who grew angry at the company behind the npm service protested by removing one of his projects, a simple function for manipulating text, which had a ripple effect across the software engineering industry as all the code that depended on it failed, and then the code that depended on that code failed, and so on. It was a hilarious mess, enough to prompt npm to change its policies. Now a software package published on npm can never be removed.\nPerhaps npm itself could go away entirely, though. By about 2019, this began to seem increasingly plausible as the company struggled to secure funding. We were teetering on the edge of a catastrophe there\u2014the entire web development industry, from small WordPress shops to large multinational firms, had come to treat as fundamental infrastructure a startup that was not yet on stable financial footing. Companies with the resources to do so began archiving a backup copy of every package that was installed, as a hedge against the uncertain future facing npm. Even though the code was free and open source, access to it through the company running the hosting service was not assured.\nAnd then in early 2020, just as the pandemic was emerging, npm was suddenly acquired by Microsoft, and to all outward appearances has run smoothly ever since. (Somewhere out there an overworked npm employee just screamed into a pillow; my apologies.) This was a natural fit given that about two years earlier Microsoft had also purchased GitHub. \nWithin about five years of its launch, GitHub had become the single most important website in the history of software development. It is essentially a web-based interface wrapped around Git, a standalone tool for managing codebases that was first released in 2005 as a means to work on the Linux operating system, and has since grown to become the standard for nearly all modern software development. GitHub quite clearly loves open source code\u2014 it\u2019s the bread and butter, the primary content displayed on the site, the most important thing it does for most everyone except its occasional enterprise customers\u2014but Git itself, the beating heart, takes this dedication to the next level.One of the most revolutionary design decisions in Git is the concept of the \u201Cremote,\u201D which refers to any copy of the code that exists elsewhere\u2014in another folder on your computer, on a server, perhaps on GitHub. Or on a GitHub competitor, for that matter\u2014GitLab is the most prominent alternative, and Keybase provides remotes to all its users; you can also tediously set up your own privately on most servers and computers. Among other things, Git mediates the interactions with remotes, and no remote is ever intrinsically privileged. As a result, a codebase stored in Git has no canonical location, so it can relocate freely in response to threats.\nI\u2019ve been developing software with Git for many years, and it has shaped my thinking so deeply that at this point I could not live without it. Yet it still feels magical to send your code off to a new remote for the first time. With one command, you can copy years of work and gigabytes of code over to a new host, keeping nearly all the context, notes, information, mistakes, and jokes intact. It feels like you\u2019ve hired professional movers to take all your stuff to your new home, which is a sensation I\u2019ve rarely encountered in other technology products. Quite the opposite\u2014the creator of WordPress recently reported that Twitter responded to user defections by explicitly switching off the ability to export user data via API on request. Thanks to the efforts of the insufferable free software nerds who build Linux, in the Git ecosystem the cost of switching is so low that it makes the success of GitHub even more remarkable. GitHub is best in class because it has to be. Its product is built atop a tech stack that dictates another company must be able to come along and eat its lunch. One might even argue that in the absence of this mechanic, the market can never really be free.\nEven after buying Twitter and dropping down the list of the wealthiest people in the world, Musk still has enough money to cover the valuations of npm, GitHub, GitLab, and Keybase combined, and could buy them and kill them off. He could not kill off the codebases they contain, though, since every project could just migrate to a new remote. Git was explicitly engineered to remain outside the reach of bad actors no matter how much money they have, and to propagate that powerful property into all the code it touches. It\u2019s not just that Git is free and open. It was designed in a way that means it can never be anything else. At this point the only way to stop it would be to build an even better replacement. Good luck!\nIf you were to build your replacement using Git as a starting point, you\u2019d still have a problem. That\u2019s because Git is licensed under the GNU General Public License, a particularly aggressive license used by open source software projects, which dictates that all downstream work must be shared openly under the same license. Since the source code for Git is itself open source, anyone can extend it and create derivatives, but it\u2019s illegal for that work to be treated as proprietary intellectual property. This property has a ripple effect: Free open source software released under this license tends to create more free open source software released under this license.These success stories are wonderful, but they all pale in comparison to Wikipedia, the greatest work of human knowledge of all time and the single most important thing ever created on the web. It was routinely mocked as absurd in its earliest days, but it is by now deeply woven into our lives\u2014it lives in your pocket all the time, and you can pull it out at a bar and talk about an article with your friend or date. We take it for granted. Its value cannot be quantified. Somehow, it is also free.\nSo in medicine, finance, and art, we should be trying to create a spiritual equivalent of Wikipedia that does whatever the discipline requires. Math, cooking, memories of dead loved ones. Computers too, possibly? GitHub doesn\u2019t count, but Git might. The \u201Csharing economy,\u201D now an entire layer of professional existence across every conceivable dimension, emerged from a glut of startups emulating rideshare companies: Uber for this, Uber for that. It became a punchline. Enough. Grow up. Nobody cares. Go make a Wikipedia for something instead.\nOpen source software has always been propelled by the vague notion that it will improve the commons, that the implicit or higher-order collaboration resulting from showing and sharing your work leads to better projects, successful companies, more ambitious ideas, greater futures. If we all stand on the shoulders of giants, then some of us will find things up there. And sure, fine \u2013 that\u2019s a utopian vision we could all use a bit more of, especially after recent events. Dorsey\u2019s reflections on Twitter\u2019s turmoil last week concluded, \u201CWe did the right thing for the public company business at the time, but the wrong thing for the internet and society.\u201D There\u2019s a tension to resolve there, sure. But I am also going to take it a step further: In a world peppered with bored billionaires, lack of open access becomes an existential risk that could suddenly wipe it all out.\nFor decades now, technology has measured achievement in things like funding rounds, company valuations, potential market, active users, downloads, and yes, stock prices. But these are all units of capitalism. One level deeper, should you choose to further interrogate it, the platform for the platform is just money. Who cares? We already know how this one goes.\nCapital can kill code. Capital can kill anything. So if what you have created is important, then so long as billionaires still exist, you are going to need to turn it into something that can\u2019t be bought. An idea that can\u2019t be killed is more valuable than an idea that can be killed, and the only thing that billions of dollars cannot kill is something that cannot have a price tag to begin with, because it exists in abundance, endlessly replicating as it spreads across the world.\nThe good news is that the better, stronger, more resilient world we need is inevitable given enough time, because the foundation has been laid. Twitter may not ultimately crumble, and even if it does, ActivityPub, Bluesky, Mastodon, and good old RSS feeds are all waiting to pick up the slack. Brilliant people will create amazing things in JavaScript, save them to GitLab remotes, and publish them on npm. Some of them have already started. These are the reasons why even the worst case scenario for Twitter under Musk would not be a complete disaster for the world\u2019s communication. We will be okay because all these pieces are already out there. We will be okay because the mistakes we made in treating Twitter as a platform were not made the last time around with an earlier generation of technologies, the ones with which Twitter was built, the ones we should strive to emulate again. We will be okay specifically because we still have the web. ❤️","post_cover":null,"author":"BY VIJITH ASSAR","title":"Billionaires Are A Security Threat","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/twitter-elon-musk-open-source-platforms\/","tags":["","PROGRAMMING","OPEN SOURCE","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","SOFTWARE","APIS","DEVELOPERS","COMMUNITIES","GITHUB"]},{"date":"12.15.2022","summary":"These past few years have been visceral reminders of our mortality.

Photography, for instance, has served as a powerful tool to help us do this. I\u2019ve explored this with my 2020 project ALIVE: Lost for Words, where I photographed people against a projected image of their lost loved ones. \nRecently, the pandemic left us feeling closer than ever to death, forcing us to confront our own mortality and the legacy we leave behind. With our normal lives disrupted by social distancing, digital tools also radically impacted our traditional death rituals. We said final goodbyes over FaceTime, mourned together via Zoom, lit virtual prayer candles from our laptops. \nREAD MORE\nThis story is from the WIRED World in 2023, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here\u2014or download or order a copy of the magazine.\nIn 2023, technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain will allow us to create new forms of posthumous digital presences. The adoption of these technologies is already opening our minds to the idea of living forever in the virtual world. For instance, in 2020, hologram experts Kaleida collaborated with Kanye West to create a hologram of Kim Kardashian\u2019s late father for her 40th birthday. Genealogy platform MyHeritage has created Deep Nostalgia, a deep-fake tool that animates the faces of departed relatives in family photos. Stonses, a blockchain-powered memorial platform, can store digital NFT replicas of our treasured possessions, affording a permanence to the memories we associate with them.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nChess Pro Answers Questions From Twitter\nIn 2023, the increased adoption of Web3 technologies will take this concept to the next level. Immersive virtual reality combined with multisensory stimulation will also allow us to interact with the image of our lost loved ones in an emotionally visceral way. We\u2019ve already seen such technology used in the entertainment industry, with premium cinema startup Positron creating a range of Voyager VR chairs that amplify cinematic experiences with haptic pillows and scent dispensers. Reimagined for memorial purposes, this tech will allow us to not just see the image of the deceased, but also smell their signature perfume and physically feel their presence on our skin.\nIn 2023, technology will also be used to not only preserve our conversations with those who have passed on, but also replicate them. This will be possible with tools such as the hyperrealistic online chatbot Project December, which uses AI to emulate the style of whatever text is fed to it. Through learning from the remnants of their digital trails\u2014text messages, blog posts, 3 am tweets\u2014AI will let us talk with a chatbot that mimics someone no longer with us.\nAs these technologies develop and become more accessible, they will increasingly be used in combination, creating \u201Cintelligent avatars\u201D of ourselves that continue to \u201Clive\u201D long after we have died. We are seeing the beginnings of this with the metaverse company Somnium Space, whose Live Forever mode allows users to create \u201Cdigital clones\u201D built from data they have stored while alive, including conversational style, gaits, and even facial expressions. \nThis sense of immortality may be reassuring, but there is a catch. AI avatars will rely on us feeding their algorithms a huge amount of personal data, accumulated through the course of our lives. If we want our digital selves to live on, this is the exchange we must accept: that the unfiltered beliefs and opinions we express today may not only be archived, but consequently used to build these posthumous personae. In other words, we can have a voice in the afterlife, but we cannot be certain about what it may say. This will force us to reconsider how our behaviors today might influence digital versions of ourselves set to outlive us. Faced with this prospect of virtual immortality, 2023 will be the year we broaden our definition of what it means to live forever, a moral question that will fundamentally change how we live our day-to-day lives, but also what it means to be immortal.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY RANKIN","title":"Digital Eternity Is Just Around the Corner","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/death-technology-memory\/","tags":["","VIRTUAL REALITY","AUGMENTED REALITY","THE WIRED WORLD IN 2023","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","DEATH","MEMORY"]},{"date":"11.27.2022","summary":"Think Washington lawmakers have what it takes to tackle the volatile world of cryptocurrencies?

Many companies opted to continue virtually attending the annual consumer trade show. Even though CES 2023 is not expected to recapture the entire grandeur of years past, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) that hosts the event anticipates around 100,000 attendees.\nCES 2023 runs from January 5 to 8, and it still offers an option for remote attendance. In spite of an economy that\u2019s worrisome for most CEOs and last year\u2019s major flops (remember NFTs?), innovative hardware announcements will continue to make a splash on the showroom floor.

Matter, a new protocol from the Connectivity Standards Alliance, enables seamless interoperability between smart home devices from Apple, Amazon, Google, Samsung, and other manufacturers. Previous fragmentation held back the overall smart home experience, especially for consumers who wanted to mix and match gadgets. \u201CThe great promise of the smart home, literally since its inception, is that all the connected gadgets would work seamlessly together,\u201D WIRED senior editor Michael Calore tells me. \u201CThat hasn\u2019t been the case at all, so Matter feels like the next big step toward that promised interoperability.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nChess Pro Answers Questions From Twitter\nLaunched last year in November, almost 300 products are already Matter-certified, with more announcements expected at CES 2023. \u201CMatter makes smart home devices easier to buy for consumers as they can now choose the products that best fit their needs, regardless of what ecosystem, smartphone, app, or voice assistant they have,\u201D writes Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, over email. Lights, locks, and thermostats are a few of the categories currently supported. The company is working to extend compatibility for additional smart home devices like cameras, appliances, and smoke detectors.\nIts unique approach to smart home security uses blockchain technology. Richardson writes, \u201CMatter also raises the bar for security, using blockchain to validate and store credentials on the home network, encrypting messages (commands) between devices, enabling local control (no cloud), and including a pathway to easy security updates.\u201D Safety experts point out cloud control as a major weakness when it comes to securing the data collected by your smart home.\nThe Metaverse Sobers Up\nAt last year\u2019s CES, plans for a utopian metaverse where consumers would live, work, and play like never before were a primary focus. While not completely scrapped, the unquestioned excitement for the concept has dissipated due to billions of dollars lost, slow consumer adoption, and turbulent macroeconomic factors.\nAlthough the tenor of discussions is subdued, you can expect hardware innovations to continue for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu anticipates a potential breakthrough moment for smart glasses as they become less cumbersome: \u201CThat's been one of the biggest barriers to the category, and I think we can expect some companies to showcase some strides in making components smaller and lighter, so that AR glasses don\u2019t have to be thick, ugly, and heavy.\u201D\nMighty Morphin\u2019 Electric Vehicles \nDuring CES 2023, you can bank on seeing plenty of electric vehicles that don\u2019t match the aesthetics of a typical car. \u201CSince EVs don\u2019t have gas tanks or traditional drivetrains, and since their battery packs can be shaped flat, the interior flooring doesn\u2019t have all the bumps or humps that we\u2019ve been dealing with for decades,\u201D writes Calore. \u201CThat frees up the designers to think about the interior in new ways, from seating configurations to entertainment systems.\u201D Although the more outlandish ideas will not be available anytime soon at your local dealer, the concept cars provide a small peek into what might be on the road five or 10 years in the future.\nA Saturation of Sustainability\nWhether it\u2019s smartphone cases created from recycled materials or TV remotes that don\u2019t need batteries, companies will continue to rethink their manufacturing process to placate a growing consumer demand for sustainable goods. \u201CI\u2019m seeing more and more companies highlight how a product is made and whether it uses recycled or sustainable materials, which seems to be the trajectory where everyone is heading,\u201D writes Chokkattu.\nSustainability trends may even impact your at-home spa nights! Decadent bubble baths are out. Decadent (albeit short) showers are in. \u201CMy one weird observation is that when the pandemic started, everyone was really talking about baths, like Kohler\u2019s ultra-luxurious Stillness Bath. Now, people are more concerned about sustainability and water usage, which means that I\u2019m seeing a lot of ultra-luxurious, uh, showers,\u201D shares WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So. \u201CI\u2019m going to go ahead and say that luxury showering is going to be a trend in 2023. Installing a low-flow showerhead that heats the air around it is good.

Chokkattu anticipates further developments for smartphone cameras, with improved data collection for applications like skin condition detection. \nSo still expects companies to launch health tracking devices specifically made for \u201Cfertile, pregnant, or immediately postpartum people,\u201D despite the overturning of Roe v.

Crypto-tracing blockchain analysis may provide an answer.","post_content":"UPDATED BELOW WITH new findings that some portion of the money may have been seized by government authorities in the Bahamas.\nCryptocurrency has always offered a strange mix of temptations and challenges for anyone trying to steal it. As digital cash, held in multibillion-dollar sums on hackable, internet-connected networks, it presents a lucrative target. But once it's stolen, the blockchains that almost every cryptocurrency is built on make it possible to follow that money's every movement and, very often, to identify the thieves. So after a massive sum of nearly half a billion dollars worth of funds was pulled out of the already collapsing FTX cryptocurrency exchange yesterday, the world's crypto tracers are now closely tracking where that loot ends up\u2014and looking for any clues that reveal the culprit to be an FTX insider or just an opportunistic hacker.\nOn Friday, hours after the major cryptocurrency exchange FTX had filed for bankruptcy in the wake of its epic, 10-figure collapse, FTX's remaining funds were drained of more than $663 million worth of cryptocurrency, much of which appears to have been stolen. \"FTX has been hacked,\" wrote an administrator in FTX's Telegram channel. \"FTX apps are malware. Delete them.\" Exactly how FTX might have been breached\u2014and whether its apps are, in fact, compromised\u2014is far from clear, and FTX hasn't officially announced any theft. But the company's US general counsel wrote in a tweet that \"unauthorized access to certain assets has occurred.\" (FTX did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.)\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nSoon, the crypto-tracing and blockchain analysis firm Elliptic revealed that the $663 million outflow seemed to be a combination of FTX's movement of coins into its own storage wallets and a mysterious theft. According to Elliptic, fully $477 million of the funds appear to have been stolen, though another crypto-tracing firm, TRM Labs, puts the number at $338 million. Twenty-four hours after the apparent heist, most of that money had moved into just a handful of cryptocurrency addresses\u2014where the entire crypto-tracing industry, a vast community of amateur crypto sleuths, and no doubt law enforcement agencies around the globe are now all watching it with an unblinking gaze.\nThat observability, for the FTX funds and for other stashes of stolen crypto, presents a serious challenge for any thief trying to cash out their haul into traditional currency. In this case, where regulators and an army of aggrieved creditors are looking for any sign that FTX's staff or owners may themselves be the culprits, it could ultimately help confirm that insiders were responsible for the theft\u2014or instead show that external hackers took advantage of the chaos at FTX to pull off a burglary.\n\"We\u2019re definitely watching the movements of these funds,\" says Chris Janczewski, the head of investigations at TRM Labs and a former special agent at the IRS's criminal investigations division. \"This potential thief has hundreds of millions of dollars. But it's like they went into a bank, took as much cash as they could carry, and then the dye packs went off. They've got all this money, but now everyone knows it's connected to this bank robbery. What can you actually do with it?\"According to Elliptic's analysis, at least $220 million of funds stolen in the form of a variety of cryptocurrencies were quickly traded through decentralized exchanges\u2014trading platforms that allow users to swap coins without giving identifying information\u2014to convert them into the cryptocurrencies ether and dai. But cashing out those coins and the rest of the stolen loot will likely require trading it on a centralized exchange, which almost always requires users to hand over identifying information. The thieves may try to put the money through a \"mixing\" service that launders the coins by blending them with those of other users. But crypto-tracing blockchain analysts have proven they can often defeat those mixers\u2014particularly when users are feeding very large sums into them. And some mixers, like the Tornado Cash service that was sanctioned by the US Treasury in August, render cryptocurrency untouchable for many exchanges or vulnerable to seizure.\nElliptic co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson later updated Elliptic's findings to point out that the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, where FTX is based, now say they seized some part of the FTX funds, which may be yet another explanation of the money's movement: Perhaps someone within FTX's staff moved the money into a government account by order of those Bahamian authorities. But Robinson notes that hardly explains the movement of millions of dollars worth of funds through decentralized exchanges, which isn't the typical behavior of a government regulator handling seized money. \"It could be that one or multiple accounts are under the control of the Bahamas authorities, but others aren\u2019t,\" says Robinson.\nIf FTX was emptied out by actual thieves or insider embezzlers, they'll find it hard to abscond with their profits in a spendable form without being identified, says Michelle Lai, a cryptocurrency privacy advocate, investor, and consultant who says she's been tracking the movements of the FTX funds with \"morbid fascination.\" But the real question, Lai says, is whether identifying those thieves would offer any recourse: After all, many of the most prolific cryptocurrency thieves are Russians or North Koreans operating in non-extradition countries, beyond the reach of Western law enforcement. \"It's not a question of whether they'll know who did it. It's whether it will be actionable,\" says Lai. \"Whether they're onshore.\"\nIn the meantime, Lai and many other crypto-watchers have been closely eyeing one Ethereum address on the blockchain-tracking site Etherscan that is currently holding around $192 million worth of the funds. The account has been sending small sums of Ethereum-based tokens\u2014some of which appear to have little to no value\u2014to a variety of exchange accounts, as well as Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin and Ukrainian cryptocurrency fundraiser accounts. But Lai guesses that these transactions are likely meant to simply complicate the picture for law enforcement or other observers before any real attempt to launder or cash out the money. And Elliptic's Tom Robinson says those transactions appear to be the work of hoaxer who have created their own fake cryptocurrency tokens to manipulate Etherscan, rather than actual payments made by the holder of FTX's wayward funds.More tellingly, Tobias Silver, founder of crypto service Just.Money, pointed out on Twitter that one of the thieves' transactions appeared to have been paid for with transaction fees funded from an account on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, which is likely required to possess identifying information for that account under \"know-your-customer\" laws. Kraken's chief security officer, Nicholas Percoco, later tweeted, \"We know the identity of the user.\" When WIRED reached out to Percoco for comment, a Kraken spokesperson responded in a statement that \"we have actively monitored recent developments with the FTX estate, are in contact with law enforcement, and have frozen Kraken account access to certain funds we suspect to be associated with 'fraud, negligence or misconduct' related to FTX (as set forth in our Terms of Service).\u201D\nThe looting or seizure of FTX's holdings\u2014whether it totals to $338 million or $477 million\u2014hardly represents an unprecedented haul in the world of cryptocurrency crime. In the late-March hack of the Ronin bridge, a gaming cryptocurrency exchange, North Korean thieves took $540 million. And earlier this year, cryptocurrency tracing led to the bust of a New York couple accused of laundering $4.5 billion in crypto.\nBut in the case of the high-profile FTX theft and the exchange's overall collapse, tracing the errant funds might help put to rest\u2014or confirm\u2014swirling suspicions that someone within FTX was responsible for the theft. The company's Bahamas-based CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who resigned Friday, lost virtually his entire $16 billion fortune in the collapse. According to an unconfirmed report from CoinTelegraph, he and two other FTX executives are \u201Cunder supervision\u201D in the Bahamas, preventing them from leaving the country. Reuters also reported late last week that Bankman-Fried possessed a \"back door\" that was built into FTX's compliance system, allowing him to withdraw funds without alerting others at the company.\nDespite those suspicions, TRM Labs' Janczewski points out that the chaos of FTX's meltdown might have provided an opportunity for hackers to exploit panicked employees and trick them into, say, clicking on a phishing email. Or, as Michelle Lai notes, bankrupted insider employees might have collaborated with hackers as a means to recover some of their own lost assets.\nAs the questions mount over whether\u2014or to what degree\u2014FTX's own management might be responsible for the missing funds, the case has begun to resemble, more than any recent crypto heist, a very old one: the theft of a half billion dollars worth of bitcoins, discovered in 2014, from Mt. Gox, the first cryptocurrency exchange. In that case, blockchain analysis carried out by cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis, along with law enforcement, helped to pin the theft on external hackers rather than Mt. Gox's own staff. Eventually, Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man, was arrested in Greece in 2017 and later convicted of laundering the stolen Mt. Gox funds, exonerating Mt. Gox's embattled executives.\nWhether history will repeat itself, and cryptocurrency tracing will prove the innocence of FTX's staff, remains far from clear. But as more eyes than ever scour the cryptocurrency economy's blockchains, it's a surer bet that the whodunit behind the FTX theft will, sooner or later, produce an answer.\nUpdate 8:40 am 11-14-22: Added details about links from one of the thieves' transactions to the Kraken exchange, which may have revealed their identity.\nUpdate 12:30 pm 11-14-22: Added a response from Kraken.\nUpdated 12:15 pm 11-18-22: Added new findings that some of the money appears to have been seized by the Bahamas Securities Commission.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"The Hunt for the FTX Thieves Has Begun","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-hack-theft-crypto-tracing\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","HACKING","FINANCE","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]},{"date":"02.11.2023","summary":"Plus: Netflix expands its efforts to end password sharing, Apple\u2019s \u201Cbuy now, pay later\u201D entry creeps closer, and we scrutinize your Bitcoin spending.","post_content":"THERE\u2019S NO SHORTAGE of tablets in the world, from the ever-dominant iPad to an assortment of Android options and Fire tabs to the niche weirdos like the E-ink and stylus Kindle Scribe. Now, OnePlus, a Chinese manufacturer known for its speedy, solid smartphones, is throwing its own Android tablet onto the table. The company announced the OnePlus Pad this week, along with the second generation of its Buds Pro bluetooth earbuds, and an all new mechanical keyboard.\nThe aluminum-bodied tablet looks to be a sleek addition to the often clunky world of Android tablets. Most notable is its 11.6-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 7:5. That\u2019s odd for a tablet; most iPad screens are 4:3, which is the same as a classic television set.

Both are sold separately. OnePlus claims the battery life is good for over 12 hours of continuous video playback; you can watch Seven Samurai three times plus a couple episodes of The Office before recharging.

Then it hastily walked that back after a public outcry. But now Netflix has officially announced it is implementing rules that prevent people who don\u2019t live in the same home from sharing a single Netflix account. The unlucky first victims of this policy are subscribers in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal.\nIn its announcement, Netflix detailed its plans for limiting account sharing. Now, anyone not living in the same household as the account holder will be prompted to transfer their profiles to a new paid account or be cut off. Netflix says the restrictions will roll out more broadly within months. It also said the service would \u201Crefine these new features based on member feedback.\u201D As you might imagine, that feedback has been not great.\nThe streaming service has been building to this for a while now, testing out these restrictions in countries with a smaller customer base. The crackdown hasn\u2019t come for the US yet, but that it will seems about as likely as Netflix canceling one of its shows after a single season. (Which is to say, very likely.)\nApple Tests Buy Now, Pay Later\nBuy-now, pay-later plans are all the rage, allowing customers to pay for stuff in interest-free installments rather than one bank-breaking chunk. Financial services like Klarna and Affirm have become very popular among cash-strapped consumers, who have even used them to buy food and holiday gifts. Of course, they\u2019ve got some problems. (Who doesn\u2019t love the idea of not paying full price and then potentially getting wracked by debt months later?)\nApple is eager to get in on the BNPL game under its own proprietary system, of course. Apple first announced the feature at its 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference, but it has yet to make its way to the public. Recently, Apple expanded its testing of the plan to employees at its retail stores, a move that has often preceded other Apple service announcements. That seems to indicate that the broader rollout of its BNPL plan is imminent.\nThe Crypto Keeper\nBack in the day, all the cool kid criminals used crypto. Blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin were hailed as an anonymous, untraceable means of payment. Aspiring lawbreakers could use crypto to buy even the darkest of dark web contraband with impunity, their identities shrouded in the mystery guaranteed by their means of payment. Or so many people thought.\nTurns out, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in fact entirely traceable. You just have to know where to look. And unfortunately for some crypto-carrying criminals, federal law enforcement officers knew exactly how to track them down.This week on Gadget Lab, WIRED senior writer and author of the book Tracers in the Dark Andy Greenberg digs into the cat-and-mouse game that is uncovering crypto cybercrime, and why even the people who depended on the complexity of crypto the most failed to understand the digital trail that it leaves behind.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY BOONE ASHWORTH","title":"OnePlus Now Has Its Own Android Tablet","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/oneplus-pad-android-tablet\/","tags":["","GEAR ROUNDUP","TABLETS","ANDROID TABLETS","NETFLIX"]},{"date":"11.11.2022","summary":"As Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire crumbles, its customers, and other crypto traders, are paying the price.","post_content":"WHEN SAMUEL REALIZED that FTX had suspended withdrawals on November 8, his hands began to tremble. The $25,000 in assets he keeps with the crypto exchange, equivalent to a decade\u2019s worth of savings, was suddenly out of his reach.\nSamuel, who asked to be referred to only by first name to preserve his anonymity, says he lives somewhere in Southeast Asia and is currently between jobs, which means money is tight. The cryptocurrency in his FTX account was his nest egg.\nSamuel first caught wind of a problem at FTX on November 6, but dismissed the reports as simple \u201CFUD\u201D\u2014a term used in crypto circles to describe baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt. He says he thought that FTX, until now one of the world\u2019s most reputable exchanges, was \u201Cbulletproof\u201D and there was no way his funds could be in danger. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried helped contribute to this misconception, tweeting on November 7 that \u201CFTX is fine. Assets are fine.\u201D (The tweet has now been deleted.)\nFEATURED VIDEO\n This week, it became clear that FTX was on the brink of collapse. Today it voluntarily started bankruptcy proceedings in the US, joining the ranks of Mt. Gox, Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, and others in the crypto hall of shame. The troubled exchange was briefly handed a lifeline on Tuesday when Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance (who goes by the name CZ), announced on Twitter that a rescue deal had been reached. But less than 48 hours later, Binance backed out, citing the results of corporate due diligence and news reports of mishandling of customer funds at FTX.\nSamuel\u2019s portfolio is made up predominantly of a cryptocurrency called XRP, the price of which is thought to have been depressed by an ongoing lawsuit between its issuer, Ripple Labs, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Recently, there have been signs the two-year legal battle may be coming to a close\u2014and Samuel had been sitting tight in the hope that a favorable ruling might send the price of XRP skyward. But now, with his tokens locked up in FTX, he won\u2019t be able to reap the rewards for his patience. \u201CI could see the finish line, but this latest drama has me hanged by the balls,\u201D he says. \u201CIt\u2019s just so much hardship.\u201D\nThere are many FTX customers with stories like this one. One FTX trader, who asked to remain anonymous, was in the US when they first heard of trouble at the exchange, which meant it was not possible to immediately withdraw their funds (FTX International, not to be confused with FTX US, is unavailable in the country.) When the FTX trader eventually used a VPN service to bypass the geo-restrictions, they found their withdrawal password needed to be reset, a process that for security reasons prevents money from being taken out of an account for 24 hours. By that time, it was already too late.\nThe FTX trader has the equivalent of $350,000 locked up in FTX, which they say amounts to 97 percent of their liquid net worth and represents 15 years\u2019 worth of savings and investment gains. Unable to access the funds, they are now \u201Cin a highly vulnerable position due to debt and other liabilities that I may now be unable to service.\u201D The fall of FTX, they say, \u201Chas changed my previously conditional trust in centralized exchanges\u2014no matter how large and reputable\u2014into an unconditional distrust.\u201DAaron Kaplan, a securities attorney and co-CEO of trading platform Prometheum, says that although the final outcome for FTX and its customers is not yet crystal clear, there is precedent in scenarios such as this for people never to recover their funds. Unfortunately, those caught up in the collapse are left with little in the way of legal recourse, says Kaplan. \u201CThe facts will come out in time. What is clear at this present moment is that FTX was taking advantage of a gray area at the heart of which was the expectation of profit, irrespective of the best interest of customers.\u201D\nIn a Twitter thread announcing the bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried implied he still hopes to help customers recover their funds. But thinking this unlikely, some FTX customers are attempting to flog their account balances at a steep discount. As reported by CoinDesk on November 9, buyers on messaging platform Telegram are bidding $0.10 to $0.15 cents on the dollar for funds tied up in FTX, gambling on the chance they may eventually be released.\nThe financial impact of the collapse extends far beyond the immediate FTX customer base, too. The week\u2019s events have sent other crypto coins into a downward spiral, with the price of both bitcoin and ether falling by more than 10 percent, wiping upward of $60 billion from the market. Large sums of SOL, the native token of the Solana network, are owned by FTX and its subsidiaries, and therefore has been hit even harder. Between November 7 and November 9, the value of SOL fell from $32 per coin to $13.\nA crypto trader who goes by the name Mando CT had at one point yesterday lost $637,000 on his SOL holdings and various Solana-based NFTs. (A slight recovery in the price of SOL, combined with other bets, has since helped him recoup some of these losses.) He says he remains confident in Solana\u2019s core value proposition and quality of the technology, and has even purchased more SOL in an attempt to \u201Cbuy the dip\u201D, but concedes the fall of FTX will have \u201Ca huge impact on the whole market.\u201D\nAlthough developers whose apps sit atop Solana claim it\u2019s still the best network for building services at scale\u2014the CEOs of both Audium and Irreverent Labs, two such development studios, say they are unconcerned about price of SOL\u2014others predict the knock-on effects of the FTX crash will have a detrimental effect on the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\u201CDevelopers in the blockchain space tend to put their efforts where the most money is located,\u201D says Francesco Melpignano, CEO at Kadena Eco, which helps to incubate new projects tied to the Kadena blockchain. \u201CIf we see funds leaking away from Solana, developers will certainly be more incentivized to build elsewhere.\u201D\nElsewhere, BlockFi says it was forced to cease operations, citing \u201Ca lack of clarity\u201D over the situation at FTX. The crypto lender had itself been bailed out by FTX US earlier this year after it was caught up in the Three Arrows Capital collapse, but its future is now uncertain, illustrating the contagion effect described by CZ earlier today. \u201CWith FTX going down, we will see cascading effects,\u201D he said. \u201CEspecially for those close to the FTX ecosystem.\u201D\nIn the days since the crisis began, FTX\u2019s Bankman-Fried, who is usually a prolific tweeter, has been uncharacteristically quiet. In a manic Twitter thread posted yesterday afternoon, he broke his silence: \u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D he tweeted. \u201CI fucked up, and should have done better.\u201D\nThe FTX founder gave a puzzling explanation of the events that led up to the fall (something to do with \u201Ca poor labeling of bank-related accounts,\u201D apparently) and set out a plan to do right by customers. \u201CWe\u2019re spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity,\u201D he wrote. \u201CEvery penny of that\u2014and of the existing collateral\u2014will go straight to users, unless or until we\u2019ve done right by them.\u201D\nAlthough it will be cold comfort to those whose funds are stranded in the exchange, Bankman-Fried has himself suffered extraordinary losses. Today, Bloomberg reported that his personal fortune, worth $16 billion just last week, has been wiped out entirely in the collapse of FTX\u2014every single dollar\u2014in what\u2019s described as \u201Cone of history\u2019s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"The Fallout of the FTX Collapse","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-fallout-of-the-ftx-collapse\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","FINANCE","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]},{"date":"11.02.2022","summary":"For years, the platform has funded a project that's meant to create a better, decentralized online experience. Now Twitter's new owner will decide its future.","post_content":"THERE ARE A hundred ways in which Elon Musk might attempt to reshape Twitter after he bought it on October 28. Thanks to the publication of the entrepreneur\u2019s personal messages in September, one thing is clear: Its future will involve decentralization. In a message to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey in March, Musk said he wanted to turn the platform into \u201Csomething new that\u2019s decentralized.\u201D And in conversation with his brother Kimbal, he tossed around the idea of a social network \u201Cbased on a blockchain,\u201D before realizing it might be too complicated.\nInstead, he could turn to Bluesky, a project incubated inside Twitter that promises to establish a \u201Cfederated social network\u201D based around an open standard that multiple platforms can adopt.\nSince it was set up under Dorsey in 2019, Bluesky has tried to create a system that lets users see how algorithms serve up content and control their personal data, and allows them to use a single profile across several social apps. Dorsey, who bonded with Musk over a shared enthusiasm for crypto, effectively pitched him the idea of using Bluesky earlier this year when he proposed that Twitter be turned into \u201Can open source protocol.\u201D Musk\u2019s response? \u201CSuper interesting idea.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nSo far, Bluesky has received at least $13 million in funding from Twitter, and Dorsey continues to be involved as a member of the board. There was precious little to show for this investment until only a few weeks ago, when Bluesky unveiled an \u201Cimproved and simplified\u201D version of its platform, called the AT Protocol, and technical documentation that showed developers how to build on top of the platform. It also set up a waitlist for its app, which will act as a browser for the network and enter private beta testing soon. Bluesky is now independent of Twitter\u2014so as to best provide \u201Cpublic benefit\u201D\u2014but whether or not the dollars keep flowing will be up to Musk.\nJay Graber, Bluesky\u2019s CEO, declined to comment on the progress of the project and the implications of Musk\u2019s acquisition, but has implied publicly that she is unconcerned about the project\u2019s future. \u201CVery curious to see where Elon is going to take Twitter,\u201D she tweeted. \u201CVery glad we\u2019re independent\u2014will keep working on building protocols that make social more resilient to rapid change.\u201D Meanwhile, in a thread published in April, soon after Musk tabled his bid, Bluesky claimed it will continue to receive funding from Twitter as long as it works toward enabling \u201Copen and decentralized public conversation\u201D\u2014a loose brief if ever there was one.\nWhat\u2019s uncertain is how the federated social network, if it were adopted under Musk, will function in practice. If Musk chooses to follow Dorsey\u2019s original vision, Twitter will become one of multiple social media services acting as a \u201Cclient\u201D for the Bluesky standard, but it\u2019s unclear quite what this will mean for the end user. Bluesky hasn\u2019t explained how the AT Protocol will change the way platforms are able to monetize and moderate content, saying only that it will create more interoperability and transparency around recommendation algorithms.Musk\u2019s chief concern will be whether he can align his philosophical affection for decentralization with the need to turn Twitter into a profitable business. He has previously expressed a desire to open source the Twitter algorithm in the name of transparency, but ceding control of the algorithm (the mechanism by which people are kept on the platform) would be another step entirely, and surely a disaster for advertising revenue.\nMusk might use Bluesky technology to partly realize his ambition to turn Twitter into \u201CX, the everything app\u201D\u2014a type of super-app that blends social media with payments and other utilities, similar to WeChat. Although the AT Protocol does not use blockchain, it is able to \u201Cintegrate with cryptocurrencies,\u201D Graber has previously said, which means Bluesky could help support the payments aspect of the vision. But again, this is all dealing in the hypothetical.\nAlthough plenty of questions hang over the implementation, Bluesky isn\u2019t alone in thinking that society would benefit from a more decentralized social media ecosystem, with less power pooled in the hands of a cash-motivated minority.\nEvan Henshaw-Plath, the first employee of Odeo (which made Twitter), runs a \u201Cpeer-to-peer social network\u201D called Planetary that shares plenty of common ground with Bluesky; both are attempting to increase transparency around algorithms and give people control of their personal data.\nHenshaw-Plath predicts that Twitter will experiment heavily with Web3 and crypto-related projects under Musk, irrespective of whether Bluesky ends up playing a starring role. \u201CI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s good,\u201D he says, \u201Cbut it\u2019s definitely where most of the big changes will be.\u201D\nHenshaw-Plath also says the acquisition might increase the chances of Bluesky securing additional funding since Twitter is no longer \u201Cconstrained by Wall Street,\u201D and suspects that Dorsey might return to Twitter in some capacity under Musk.\nOnce the AT Protocol is up and running, the aim is to enable a level of interaction between Planetary and Bluesky networks, says Henshaw-Plath, creating a sort of coalition motivated by the shared desire to tip the balance of power in favor of users.\nThis is also the ambition of Stani Kulechov, the creator of Lens Protocol, a similar project that relies on users self-hosting their profiles to create decentralization\u2014an alternative to Bluesky\u2019s cloud-based model. He says this approach \u201Cenables people to own their social capital\u201D in terms of both their content and audience, and ensures social profiles are \u201Calways in your custody and control.\u201D\nBut while efforts to minimize companies\u2019 control over the way people communicate should be celebrated, there are short-term dangers that need to be taken into account, says Brewster Kahle, the creator of the Internet Archive, who was recently inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. \u201CIf decentralization brought local control to more people in how they build their communities, that would be a good thing,\u201D says Kahle. But the concern is that a lack of clarity over the mechanics of moderation under this new model might lead to the kind of \u201Cfree-for-all hellscape\u201D Musk says he is determined to avoid. \u201CIn the short term, decentralization could mean there is no content moderation or spam controls at all, giving a louder megaphone to a few,\u201D Kahle adds.\nFor this reason, Kahle says getting the technology right is all-important, but there are \u201Cwarning signs of simplistic, absolutist thinking\u201D among those attempting to innovate in the social media space that could jeopardize the whole endeavor.\nIt\u2019s up to Musk, the \u201Cfree speech absolutist\u201D and world\u2019s richest individual, to carry forward the vision for a more equitable, more private, less antagonistic social media experience. If he decides not to, Bluesky will have to fly the nest in search of backing elsewhere.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Twitter Had a Plan to Fix Social Media.

We tested its new Metavertu handset and were led down a rabbit hole of legal disputes and security concerns.","post_content":"WHY WON\u2019T VERTU die? It\u2019s the cockroach of phone companies. The once huge LG made its smartphone exit in 2021. HTC and Sony are just about clinging on by their fingertips. And yet the ultra-niche Vertu just recently announced a phone as bold and bombastic as anything it has made to date: the Metavertu. \nIt starts at £2,787 ($3,330), then tops out at a mind-boggling £34,534 ($41,262) for the borderline offensive Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamond model. And that may not even be the most eye-opening part: Vertu markets this thing as the \u201Cworld\u2019s first Web3 phone,\u201D a claim that would set off alarm bells had they not already been ringing since first sight of the Vertu name.\nA History of Violence\nWhy? Over the years, Vertu has been responsible for some of the most tasteless and gaudy phones to roll off a production line. However, it started off as a Nokia side brand in 1998. Those early years gave us some undeniably striking phones, like the relatively elegant Vertu Signature from 2003. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nScam Fighters Answer Scam Questions From Twitter\nBy 2012, Nokia\u2019s phone market share had dropped from heights of 50.8 percent to under 5 percent. Vertu was sold to a private equity group, then bounced between owners from Turkey and China. This period saw a handful of handset designs that could be compared to handbags that hang around season after season in TJ Maxx stores (\u201CTK Maxx\u201D if you\u2019re outside of the US). There was a great deal of rampantly embossed leather and contours. \nAlmost all Vertu phones have been criticized for their outdated tech and sky-high pricing. They are, and always have been, phones for people with more money than taste or sense. \nVertu's Metavertu \u201CAlligator Leather Flame Red\u201D\u2014yours for £5,408.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nHowever, the Vertu Metavertu feels quite different. It is a legit high-performance phone, and while the base design is pedestrian and some of its specs are slightly past their prime, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, components available at the phone\u2019s October 2022 launch were not drastically better. The MetaVertu has a bold OLED screen and a responsive triple rear cameras that included a powerful 5x zoom. Its stereo speakers are loud, and just lack a little of the bass impact of the very best. My Metavertu review sample has 1 TB of storage and an almost over-the-top 18 GB of DDR5 RAM. \nIt even comes with a tempered glass screen protector attached, perfectly matching the slick curved glass of the display\u2014even top-end phones use basic plastic protectors, if they have one at all. \nSurprisingly, this feels like a true flagship Android in a way no Vertu phone really has since the pre-iPhone era. But to look at Vertu as a company in 2023, it all makes very little sense. \nVertu\u2019s Not-So-Secret Base\nThe company address that Vertu lists on its homepage is that of a single room on the fifth floor of an office block in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Search for it online and you\u2019ll also find an accountancy firm, a furniture exporter, an advertising agency, and a toy company all registered to the same \u201Croom 505.\u201D \nBack in the old days, one of the key selling points of a Vertu phone was that it was \u201Cmade in England.\u201D The handsets were assembled at a small factory in Church Crookam, a village next to Fleet, in Hampshire, about 90 minutes\u2019 drive from London. However, that factory was demolished in 2020 to make way for a supermarket. According to Google Street View, you\u2019ll find Aldi and Home Bargains in the spot where Vertu\u2019s old headquarters stood.\nVertu\u2019s days at that factory did not end well. \u201CHere was a tech business where one day their landlords came into the HQ\u2014the factory you mentioned\u2014and took away the toilet rolls, as they had not paid their bills,\u201D says a source who worked with the brand for many years. \u201CThe business collapsed, owing £65 million ($80 million) and laying off 200 staff,\u201D they told us. WIRED was unable to independently verify these numbers; however, at the time, the BBC and Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the money Vertu owed was even higher, at £128 million. \nWhile Vertu may still have \u201CVertu England\u201D on its Facebook posts, the brand has nothing to do with the UK anymore, besides trying to flog phones to the occasional rich person there. \nBut if Vertu went bankrupt rather catastrophically in 2017, how is it alive today, with the same Godin Holdings figure, Gary Chen (or Chen Gang), at its head giving the new phone's launch presentation in 2022?\nThe Hidden Hand Behind Metavertu\nThe Metavertu has at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone\u2019s hardware tags.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nA closer look at the phone reveals some clues. Hardware data scraper app Device Info uncovered at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone\u2019s hardware tags\u2014the cameras, the battery, the \u201Cbuilder\u201D tag, and more.ZTE is a phone manufacturer known for both its own phones and ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) models, where a brand partners with a manufacturer in order to make use of their existing factories and supply chains. You provide the design specifics, they crank out the units. This was how phone networks like Vodafone made own-brand handsets. If the handset is made by ZTE, perhaps this is the only way making the Metavertu could have been viable, particularly as a smartphone likely to sell in tiny numbers?\n\u201CVertu has changed hands lots of over the past decade, but is still being run by a bunch of folks based out of Hong Kong, very close to the Chinese supply chain,\u201D says Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. \u201CThese folks with renewed focus are rebadging existing models from brands\u2014ZTE, for example\u2014with luxury materials and advanced hardware and software.\u201D\nTake another look at the Metavertu with this in mind, and you\u2019ll find it looks very similar to the ZTE Nubia Z40 Pro from early 2022. They have eerily similar camera sensors, lens and flash placement, processor, and display specs, and even share a red accented power button on the side. From the front they look nearly identical.\nSlap an expensive carbon fiber, ceramic, and sapphire backplate on the £500 to £800 Nubia Z40 Pro, and you\u2019ll get a Metavertu, more or less. And if this Basic Carbon Fiber £2,915 ($3,592) design doesn\u2019t do it for you\u2014looking, as it does, a little like an Asus ROG gaming phone\u2014why not upgrade to the red alligator leather version for a mere £6,073 ($7,464)?\nThe Metavertu is no ordinary phone, for sure, but it would seem someone else has had a hand in the \u201Ccreating extraordinary\u201D factor you\u2019ll see mentioned on Vertu's self-aggrandizing lock-screen images.\nIt\u2019s All In the Web3\nThis all leaves Vertu\u2019s software as potentially the more substantive draw of the Metavertu experience. And given it is supposedly the \u201Cworld\u2019s first Web3 phone,\u201D that makes sense. \u201CThe positioning is \u2018geek luxury\u2019\u2014completely different versus the \u2018fashion luxury\u2019 of older Vertu phones,\u201D says Shah.\nClassic Vertu models came with a concierge service, which was outsourced to a third-party company. The Metavertu still has a concierge of sorts, but this time it\u2019s in the shape of hotel, air ticket, and restaurant reservation forms that quite literally link you to a Google Sheets page inside a Vertu Life app.\nThe process is much like booking directly on a website for yourself, but is sure to put hackles up about privacy and security. Or at least it should. Alternatively, you can call the \u201Cconcierge line\u201D phone number, but this is exactly the same generic customer service number found published on Vertu\u2019s own website. Luxury service, indeed.\nWe Offer No Guarantees\nStill, the concierge service is old news. It\u2019s not Web3; it\u2019s not even Web 2.0. But what is a Web3 phone? Many of you may be wondering what Web3 even means. \nThe term Web3 refers to technologies such as cryptocurrencies, ideas of turning video games into commodities marketplaces (more than they currently are), and pretty much anything to do with the blockchain. Now, Web3 has interesting potential and is a honeypot for venture capital investment, but is also replete with opportunists ready and willing to exploit the credulous.This VC clientele chimes with Vertu\u2019s approach. \u201CThe target market seems to be tech investors, investment bankers, crypto buffs, and so forth,\u201D says Shah of the Metavertu\u2019s seemingly ideal customer. \nVertu owner Gary Chen played this angle hard at the phone\u2019s London launch at the end of last year, which was attended by many crypto enthusiasts and fashion types, and barely any technology reporters. He spouted seemingly-endless meandering twaddle about Web3 while at one point even misrepresented the phone itself. Contrary to the company head\u2019s claims, for example, the Metavertu does have Google Play access.\nA Web3 Reality\nWeb3 lives in the Metavertu as a stack of custom apps that range from the prosaic to the bizarre. They all sit in a password-protected Meta Space base app, which claims to be encrypted. You input a password to enter it, like a \u201Csecure\u201D-file-store app you may have tried before. \nInside, there\u2019s a place to store your crypto wallet details, called Value. Vbox offers cloud storage. Dappstore is an app store that is, at the time of writing, empty aside from Vertu\u2019s own stuff and a few web shortcuts posing as apps. Venture is a custom web browser whose homepage is stacked with crypto links, and VShot is a camera app that lets you \u201Cmint\u201D up to five images a day.\nThis last one is sure to pick up some attention. Minting typically refers to the creation of an NFT. A phone that mints NFTs? That\u2019s the dream (for some). However, while Vertu calls this an NFT camera, it appears to primarily be a way of proving copyright ownership by linking the file to a unique ID (DID). It\u2019s not clear whether there\u2019s any blockchain action going on here. \nWhy can\u2019t we tell you definitively? Vertu demands you supply not just your real name and either your drivers license number or passport number to use Vshot, but a picture of its information page and a picture of you holding your ID. You\u2019re left waiting up to five minutes with the load bar spinning before you\u2019ll see this bizarre info request, too.\nIf this doesn\u2019t make you worried, it should. Vertu\u2019s terms of service claims this ID is required by the People\u2019s Republic of China, and goes on to leave one with the impression that maybe you shouldn\u2019t bet the bank on any \u201Cdue diligence\u201D from Vertu in checking the apps made available through the Dapp store, among other worrying clauses. The entire poorly written script doesn\u2019t quite reach the levels of \u201Cif you use this software, you are on your own should something go wrong,\u201D but let\u2019s just say it is very different from the T+Cs pages you'd expect from any \u201Cnormal\" app store. We\u2019re certainly not in the Google Play Store anymore. \nNever before have I used a phone where I felt so unsafe, one that feels like it could be used to scam me\u2014though, to be clear, I have no evidence that it is. This really is a Web3 phone, then, just perhaps not in the sense the aspiring crypto bros hoped for.If you\u2019re about to dismiss this as anti-Web3 paranoia, just wait a minute. Right now at least two versions of Vertu exist online. There\u2019s the Vertu that makes the Metavertu, based in Hong Kong and China, and Vertu AK France.\nVertu AK France accuses the current Chinese incarnation of Vertu of \u201Cmassive accounting and financial fraud\u201D on its website, and claims to be the \u201Creal\u201D Vertu online while selling classic Vertu handsets that must have been manufactured years ago. \nVertu AK France is not your classic underdog, though. It is owned by Hakan Uzan, a man exiled from Turkey amid fraud investigations that led to 219 companies under the Uzan umbrella being seized, and his brother Cem Uzan being sentenced in absentia to 23 years in prison for racketeering. Members of the Uzan family have been living in France, having been granted political asylum. In 2021, Hakan and Cem Uzan attempted to sue Vodafone, Motorola, BlackRock, and other entities for a combined $68 billion for those assets seized almost two decades prior. \nThe Metavertu \u201CBasic\u201D Carbon Fiber handset and the flagship Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamonds model, which costs £34,534.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nWIRED contacted Vertu AK France in an attempt for clarification. Vertu AK France did not respond. We asked Vertu in Hong Kong to provide proof of ownership and explain how both it and Vertu AK France could claim to own the Vertu brand. In response, Vertu Hong Kong gave us documentation appearing to show that it has owned the trademark for the name \u201CVertu\" in more than 40 countries but notably not in France.\nThis leaves Vertu in the position where two companies are claiming ownership of the brand, each accusing the other of substantial fraud. \nMetavertu\u2019s luxury facade is a fragile illusion, and the Vertu story just gets weirder the closer you look. As pleasant as the Metavertu is to use, we do not want to hand over our passport details just to use its questionable software features, and you shouldn\u2019t either.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDREW WILLIAMS","title":"We Tried Vertu\u2019s \u2018Web3\u2019 Phone.

Here\u2019s how it works and how to sign up.","post_content":"MOVIEPASS, THE BELEAGUERED startup that aimed to revolutionize seeing movies at the theater (and sort of did, indirectly) is back. After bankruptcy, a pandemic that shut down movie theaters anyway, and an acquisition, it's taking another crack at the subscription model. Here's what we know about MoviePass 2.0.\nWhat Happened to the Old MoviePass?\nIn case you're not up to speed, here's the short version: For several years, MoviePass offered a simple subscription for watching movies in theaters. The company experimented with different models, such as $15\/month for a couple of movies, or $40 to $50 per month for unlimited movies. \nThen, in 2018, the company made a bold, absurd change: up to a movie every day for $10 a month. In many parts of the country, that's less than the price of a single movie ticket. And MoviePass was paying full price to theaters for every ticket. Millions of users signed up, and why wouldn't they? It was essentially free money from MoviePass.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nMeet the Guy Making Horror Movie Masks for 40 Years\nThe plan didn't go well. Over time, MoviePass had to raise prices, customer support started languishing, and the company's alternative plans to generate revenue fell through. Worse (for MoviePass, but great for us), theater chains themselves started offering their own subscriptions. \nThese were more financially viable, since theaters pay less to studios for tickets than MoviePass paid to theaters. Plus, even if theaters took a loss on ticket sales, they would still benefit from increased concessions revenue. (At one point, in an attempt to bring in revenue, MoviePass argued that it should get a cut of theaters' concessions sales. This also didn't go well.)\nEventually MoviePass went into bankruptcy, and one of the company's cofounders, Stacy Spikes, bought back the company. Why is all this history relevant? Well, if you're planning to sign up, it's worth keeping in mind that this is yet another in a long line of attempted business models. It remains to be seen whether this one will work out.\nHow Do I Sign Up for MoviePass?\nThe current iteration of MoviePass (dubbed MoviePass Beta) is rolling out in stages\u2014presumably to help mitigate a similar rush-and-crash that its predecessor experienced, which is certainly a risk factor, since the waitlist itself crashed the minute it went live). On August 25, 2022, the company opened up a waitlist for five days. \nIf you signed up for the waitlist during that window, you're in line to get an invite to the new MoviePass. Once you're in, you'll get a cache of invites that you can send to your friends. If you missed the waitlist period, finding someone with one of these invites will be your best bet until around summer 2023.\nMoviePass Beta isn't launching in all markets at once. The company says that it's gauging interest in different parts of the country based on how many people sign up for the waitlist in an area. Many major cities like Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and Austin have already gained access. Prices will also vary somewhat based on what city you're in, particularly in New York and California.There are three main price tiers at around $10, $20, and $30 per month (with a fourth $40 tier \u201Cin select markets\u201D). Rather than providing a set number of movies, these plans give you a certain number of credits. These credits can be spent on buying movie tickets, and some of your unused credits will roll over to the next month. It's a more complicated system than in the past, so let's break down how it works.\nHow Does the New MoviePass Work?\nThe details of the system were vague when the company presented its comeback plan back in February 2022. Fortunately, we've gotten into the beta and have a clearer idea of how it works. Note: I'm using the service in Austin, Texas. Some details and prices may differ depending on where you live, or if the service changes before the full public release later this summer.\nFirst, the MoviePass card is back. In black, this time, instead of the previous iconic red. Similar to the old MoviePass, you'll use this card to pay for your ticket instead of your own debit card. Unfortunately, this leads to the biggest limitations of MoviePass: You can only buy tickets in person at the theater, and only for the same day. It's not possible to buy tickets for a movie in advance.\nHowever, there are (apparently) select theaters that support e-ticketing where some of these restrictions may not apply. I wasn't able to test this, as every theater within 50 miles of me\u2014including AMC, Regal, Alamo, and several independent chains\u2014all require the card. \nYour MoviePass subscription gives you a set number of credits and, depending on the movie's showtime, it will cost a certain number of credits to purchase a ticket. Matinees (any movie before 4 pm) generally cost 10 credits, while evening movies cost 15 credits on weekdays and 20 credits on weekends. And Friday night counts as a weekend, naturally.\nThis credits system means that how many movies you can see per month depends on a number of factors. The basic $10\/month plan comes with 34 credits, for example. That's enough for three matinees, or one weekend evening movie. However, let's say you spend 20 credits on a weekend movie and have 14 left over. The next month, you'll get another 34, for a total of 48. So that month you could watch two weekend movies.\nWell. Sort of. The company's documentation is a little inconsistent during the beta. On MoviePass' FAQ page, the company says that up to two months' worth of credits will roll over. So, in this example, you could bank up to 68 credits. So you could save up some, but eventually you'll hit a use-it-or-lose-it wall.\nHowever, in my experience on the mobile app, I found different information. On one page showing the subscription options, a note says, \u201CHalf of your remaining credits are kepto [sic] to the next month if a subscription is active.\u201D In another part of the app, it tells me that all 34 of my unused credits will roll over.In other words, it's a beta. This isn't a proper review of the service, so I won't hold some inconsistencies or typos against it. But if you're going to try out the beta, it's worth keeping in mind how much the details might change over the next few months. If you were burned by the inconsistencies of MoviePass in the pass, it might be a little more stable now, but you can still expect a bit of turbulence.\nIt's also worth noting that, as of right now, the price (in credits) per ticket isn't changing based on which movie you're watching, but we can't say for certain this won't happen in the future. As of writing, it costs just as many credits to watch Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania on a Friday night as it does to watch Cocaine Bear. Even though one of those is clearly going to be more popular. Here's hoping it stays that way.\nIs Crypto Involved?\nOne of the strangest aspects of MoviePass's February 2022 presentation is that it seemed to be trying very hard not to come off as a crypto company. It touted its new vision as \u201Cpowered by Web3 technology,\u201D\u2014Web3 usually being a shorthand for blockchain- and\/or crypto-based products, two words that MoviePass was careful to steer clear of.\nDuring the presentation, MoviePass mentioned tokens that would be tradable and could roll over from month to month. This sounds like it describes the credits that roll over in the current plan, but there's no trading functionality yet. To be clear, the company hasn't discussed these features beyond that presentation, and at the time of writing the company's FAQ page doesn't mention them. However, they may eventually be part of the package, which would raise questions about how these tokens are supposed to work.\nFor example, during the presentation, the company discussed PreShow, its facial recognition, eye-tracking technology that MoviePass wants to use to show users ads. The more ads a user watches\u2013and really watches, as confirmed by PreShow\u2013the more tokens they earn. Or at least, that was the hypothetical plan laid out in February. There may be other ways that credits can be earned beyond the basic subscription in the future.\nBeyond that, there's no clear info on what Web3 would mean in this context. For now, we're in a wait-and-see formation. Nothing about MoviePass' new model sounds as obviously broken as its plan to charge users $10 for $12 movie tickets, but the success or failure of this iteration of MoviePass is going to be in the details.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6430678a041a8e6d9915b423\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/New-MoviePass-Gear-GettyImages-475143879.jpg","author":"BY ERIC RAVENSCRAFT","title":"Everything You Should Know About the New MoviePass","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/new-moviepass-features\/","tags":["","MOVIES","FILM","CULTURE","MULTIMEDIA"]},{"date":"03.15.2023","summary":"How biometrics, hybrid solutions, and new digital credential technologies are transforming identity verification\u2014and everyday life.","post_content":"IN 2024, THE European Union (EU) is scheduled to unveil a new tool for seamless international travel\u2014the Digital Identity Wallet. The app will store personal data such as passports, driver\u2019s licenses, and banking info for quick verification when crossing the border into any of the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, and for easy access to money while abroad. \nThe platform is a response to growing demand for digital identity verification in Europe. In 2021, the EU\u2019s Digital COVID Certificate allowed citizens to easily share vaccination status via a QR code that could be printed out or displayed on a smartphone. In addition, 14 countries representing roughly 60 percent of the EU\u2019s population already have some kind of digitized national identification. The digital wallet will be the most ambitious rollout yet of a comprehensive digital ID system, combining security, compliance, and privacy safeguards for the EU\u2019s 447 million citizens.\n\u201CWe want the EU to become the first global region with a governance framework for trusted digital identities,\u201D stated a member of the European Parliament in February. \u201CThe digital wallet will become a reliable, all-in-one identity gateway that puts citizens in full control of their own data and gives them the freedom to decide exactly what information to share, with whom, and when \u2026 a new driver of civic engagement and social empowerment and a tool for an inclusive digital Europe.\u201D\nThe digital wallet is the latest, highest-profile example of a worldwide trend: the demise of passwords and the rise of digital identities. In a December 2022 study of 1,450 global consumers by Entrust\u2014a leader in secure identities, payments, and data\u2014just 6 percent stated that passwords are the most secure method of identity verification online, and more than half said they needed to reset their passwords at least once a month because they forgot them.\u201CNobody likes passwords,\u201D says Greg Wetmore, the vice president of software development at Entrust. \u201CThey\u2019re awkward, not very useful, and easy to steal.\u201D\nConsumers want digital verification methods that easily and securely share information that\u2019s relevant for each interaction, leading to growth in platforms and methods that will transform our lives in the years ahead.\n\u201CThis technology is in its early phases,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CBut there are really interesting pilot projects leading the charge, and Entrust has found that ultimately the future of identification is hybrid\u2014physical and digital.\u201D\nUnlocking the World\nMost of us already use an alternative to password authentication every day: scanning our thumbs or faces to unlock our smartphones. This is biometric technology, based on a person\u2019s unique biological characteristics, like fingerprints, facial shapes, voices, and retinas, and it\u2019s quickly becoming the default for verifying identity. These methods are more secure and convenient than passwords, and consumers prefer them. According to Entrust\u2019s survey, 74 percent of respondents said that when they\u2019re given the option between biometrics and passwords, they choose biometrics at least half the time.\nIn most places around the world, biometrics are already making air travel easier. The U.S. employs them in its Global Entry program, and in the United Kingdom travelers on Eurostar trains can use their face as both their ticket and e-passport when traveling throughout Europe. Authorities are updating the system so travelers can use biometrics upon entering the UK as well, and the EU is aiming to replace physical passports with digital verification by the end of 2023. \u201CEurope won\u2019t be stamping passports anymore,\u201D says Gord Wilson, the vice president of identity verification at Entrust. \u201CInstead, they\u2019ll capture facial images, scanning and confirming your identity, as opposed to capturing it and going through that whole process.\u201D\nUltimately, our smartphones will become our primary identity verification tool, providing access to various digital credentials, and that means biometrics will likely be the key to unlocking access. In addition, due to their widespread use, smartphones with biometric verification could help provide IDs for the one billion people who currently don\u2019t have a legal identity\u2014opening up ways for citizens to start bank accounts, vote, get access to healthcare and more.\n\u201CThat\u2019s a huge gap that needs to close, and I think governments have a role to play,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CMobile phones are everywhere in less developed countries and can become a great enabler, bringing more people online.\u201D\nElectronic IDs and Hybrid Solutions Provide the Right Mix\nWith the move to digital tools, it may be surprising to learn that physical IDs will also play an integral part in identity verification going forward. \u201CEntrust believes the blending of physical and digital will be really important,\u201D Wetmore says.\nToday, so-called eIDs\u2014physical identification containing a chip for electronic verification\u2014are on the rise, with more than 164 countries already issuing e-passports. The pandemic helped usher in this change, thanks to demand for contactless solutions, although consumers are still catching up. In Entrust\u2019s survey, 43 percent of respondents said they already had an eID, 36 percent said they didn\u2019t, and 21 percent weren\u2019t sure. This demonstrates that there\u2019s confusion on the issue, since in many countries, including the U.S., passport holders are automatically issued an e-passport. (Only 27 percent of U.S. survey respondents said they had one.) But when eIDs are an option, they\u2019re popular. Seventy percent of respondents said they\u2019d use an electronic ID if one were available. In the future, hybrid solutions\u2014a driver\u2019s license with a scannable RFID chip, for example\u2014will be pervasive.   \n\u201CIn the hybrid future, consumers can use a highly secure passport document to enroll for a digital identity and use that online or via their phone,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CThat identity-verification mechanism takes a high-assurance physical identity and turns it into a high-assurance digital identity. It\u2019s a trend we see happening today, and our technology supports it.\u201D\nDecentralized Identity and Ownership Is the Future\nTo unlock seamless identity verification going forward, consumers will need to share more information\u2014an inevitability they accept.\nIn Entrust\u2019s survey, 74 percent of respondents agreed that sharing personal information in exchange for goods, services, or apps was unavoidable. This is why decentralized identity, which uses distributed ledger technologies (blockchain, for example) for verification, is intriguing. In this scenario, consumers could control which information is shared with a third party through a digital identity wallet that confirms or denies a verification request. For example, you could scan your phone to prove that you\u2019re over 21, but that would be the only information shared with the restaurant or liquor store\u2014not your home address, your email address, or even your date of birth, which is something on everyone\u2019s drivers license. It would simply confirm that you\u2019re over 21. \n\u201CThe future is decentralized identity,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CIn your mobile wallet, you\u2019ll have a number of verifiable credentials. Then you can choose which one you want to use for what service, which makes it really helpful as well as an easy experience.\u201D\nDecentralized identity eliminates reliance on third parties and helps consumers retain control of their identifiers\u2014an easier and more secure approach to daily verification.\n\u201CIn the future of travel, your whole journey will be powered by shared, trusted documents that transfer from government to industry,\u201D Wilson says. \u201CThat process will be supported by trusted infrastructure with decentralized identity, and we\u2019ll start seeing that implemented in the next two years.\u201D\nUltimately, consumers will be able to just share the information that truly matters.\n\u201CPeople will start to have a greater ability to only release the minimum amount of data required for a service or transaction,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CAs digital adoption goes up, friction goes down, and people\u2019s control over their personal information will increase.\u201D\nThis story was produced by WIRED Brand Lab for Entrust.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6411edc64ac1d7b657dc7c51\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/ETDC_Wired_HeroImage_PASSWORDLESS_FUTURE_1280x720NoText_.jpg","author":null,"title":"Our Passwordless Future","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/our-passwordless-future\/","tags":[""]},{"date":"12.07.2022","summary":"Bitcoin miners say they can help stabilize a shaky power grid and prevent blackouts. Experts say it will make the problem worse.","post_content":"IN FEBRUARY 2021, when 246 people in the US state of Texas lost their lives during a powerful storm and its ensuing blackout, the finger of blame was pointed at the state\u2019s faltering electricity grid. Texas, it would emerge, was uniquely ill-equipped to cope with such extreme weather. Built in a time when temperature swings were less extreme, the state\u2019s power plants struggled to operate, creating a supply crisis just as Texans ramped up demand by trying to keep warm. \nTexas found itself trapped and unable to pull power from farther afield, as its grid is isolated from the rest of the US\u2014a measure designed to liberate the state from federal regulation. The brutal winter storm showed that Texas needed a plan to stabilize its grid. Now, it\u2019s found one: bitcoin mining.\nIt might seem counterproductive to invite energy-guzzling bitcoin miners onto a vulnerable grid, but the plan has the support of Texas governor Greg Abbott. In May 2021, Abbott signed into law the Virtual Currency Bill, which legitimized bitcoin and made it easier for miners to come to the state. As he embarks on a third term in office, Abbott says he intends to make Texas the \u201Ccenterpiece\u201D of the Bitcoin movement, which he describes as the \u201Ccutting edge of innovation.\u201D \nFEATURED VIDEO\nFormer NASA Astronaut Breaks Down a Rocket Launch\nAnd it doesn\u2019t get much more \u201Ccutting edge\u201D than using crypto mines to shore up a struggling electricity grid. But Lee Bratcher, founder of the Texas Blockchain Council, a pro-crypto lobbying group, says there\u2019s method to the madness. He claims crypto mining can act like a \u201Cdemand-side battery\u201D that \u201Ccreates a safety valve for the grid,\u201D reducing the likelihood of blackouts.\nIn Bratcher\u2019s terms, it works like this: In periods of low demand, big crypto mines can plug into sources of renewable power that would otherwise be wasted, thereby increasing the profitability of wind and solar and encouraging new development. Then, when demand from the grid is high, miners shut off their operations to allow power to be channeled toward regular people.\nAlthough Texas produces more renewable energy than any other US state, its grid is propped up by an aging fleet of fossil fuel plants, some of which have been running without maintenance to keep pace with energy demand. At an average age of 50 and 30 years, respectively, the state\u2019s coal and gas plants are reaching the end of their useful lives. Core to Abbott\u2019s plan is the theory that the additional demand for energy created by new bitcoin-mining facilities will establish \u201Can investment incentive\u201D that brings new sources of power generation to Texas. Then, when energy demand goes through the roof during a heat wave or cold snap, the state will have more energy flowing through its grid and the option to redirect power as a last resort.\nThe plan to use crypto mines as giant batteries is controversial, to say the least. Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, claims the battery analogy is \u201Cnonsense\u201D because miners don\u2019t store and release energy, but rather only promise to stop consuming when it\u2019s urgently needed elsewhere. And he disputes the idea that crypto mining will bring additional energy generation to the grid, which he describes as misdirection designed to distract from the price increases people will incur due to an overall rise in energy demand.\nDemand for energy in Texas is set to skyrocket as a result of Abbott\u2019s plan. Miners in the state are currently using around 2 gigawatts (GW) of energy, with peak capacity for the state topping out at 80 GW. By 2026 it\u2019s estimated that Texas bitcoin miners will draw as much as 29 GW\u2014four times as much as the whole of New York City. \nFor the opportunity to test his theory, Abbott has the Chinese Communist Party to thank. When China banned crypto mining in June 2021 (outwardly for environmental reasons), some of the world\u2019s largest miners\u2014including Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific, Argo Blockchain, and others\u2014either set up shop or expanded operations in Texas.\nThe miners were attracted to Texas for its cheap power, plentiful supplies of renewable energy, and hands-off approach to regulation. The libertarian ambitions of the cryptocurrency movement, as laid out in the original Bitcoin white paper, also dovetail neatly with the state\u2019s identity. \u201CTexas is all about freedom,\u201D says Andy Long, CEO of crypto mining company White Rock. \u201CSo Texas and Bitcoin go hand-in-hand.\u201D\nThere are now ten industrial-scale mining facilities operating in Texas, the largest of which by power capacity (at 750 megawatts) is operated by Riot and situated on a 100-acre plot in the town of Rockdale. And the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator, says there is a long queue of companies awaiting approval for new mining installations.\nThe way facilities receive their energy differs on a case-by-case basis. To power its mining equipment in west Texas, Marathon Digital draws partly from the grid and partly from so-called stranded energy\u2014power from solar and wind farms that isn\u2019t needed by the grid or cannot be sold due to infrastructure constraints. In exchange for Marathon agreeing to purchase energy at a set rate at all hours of the day, the renewable provider gives the firm a cut of the profits whenever the grid is willing to pay a higher price, benefitting both parties.\nAnother way miners can turn a profit is by participating in ERCOT demand response programs, which for years have provided a way for factories and other industry-scale energy consumers to help stabilize the grid. Under this system, mining companies that buy energy in batches are compensated for switching off when a blackout looms. Meanwhile, those that have power purchase agreements (contracts that allow them to buy energy in advance at a set price) with energy suppliers can shut off when demand is high and sell their allocation to the grid at a premium.According to Trudi Webster, a spokesperson for ERCOT, this arrangement helps to \u201Cmaintain grid reliability\u201D because participants can \u201Cincrease or decrease consumption to support system needs.\u201D This principle was put to the test in July, when a heat wave drove energy consumption to record highs and 95 percent of large-scale miners in Texas were said to have shut down. One mining company, Riot, said it earned $9.5 million in energy credits during the heat wave for switching off operations, more revenue than it earned from mining bitcoin in the same period (roughly $6.9 million).\nFred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, claims that crypto miners participating in demand response schemes have helped to stave off blackouts in Texas this year. Mining facilities acted \u201Clike a capacitor,\u201D he says, echoing the battery metaphor, allowing the grid to remain on an even keel.\nEnthusiasm for the plan from Abbott and other crypto enthusiasts has been punctured by academics who claim even the basic premise is flawed. The idea of using huge crypto mines to control energy demand is based on \u201Cmisunderstandings and misrepresentations of the grid and how it operates,\u201D says Adrian Shelley, an energy policy expert and branch director of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Although crypto mines are unique in their ability to switch off at short notice (unlike a factory, which may take hours to shut down), Shelley says the case for placing the extra strain on the grid in the first place is full of holes. Abbott\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\nShelley argues it \u201Cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201D to pay miners for alleviating the strain they themselves are putting on the grid. In addition, much of the miners\u2019 purchasing power gained directly from the grid is likely to decrease when demand spikes, as mining is no longer profitable under these conditions due to the rise in energy prices.\nHirs says there are millions of consumers already connected to the grid that would happily shut off their power in exchange for financial compensation, without adding additional strain to the grid or causing a price increase. Under the instruction of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the state utilities regulator, ERCOT launched a pilot program earlier this month to investigate how regular people can help support grid reliability\u2014but Hirs says this should have happened years ago.\nThe flood of crypto miners arriving in Texas has also attracted the attention of lawmakers. In a letter addressed to ERCOT, a group of US politicians headed by US senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) expressed fears that crypto mining will \u201Cadd to the stress on the state\u2019s power grid.\u201D Shelley shares the same concern: \u201CThere\u2019s no way the grid could handle all that demand,\u201D he says.\nIn its response to the letter, ERCOT explained it will not allow new mining facilities to power up if there is a risk of destabilizing the grid. But the operator also said it\u2019s not in the business of predicting the impact of mining on the price of energy for consumers. Doug Lewin, president of Stoic Energy, a Texas-based energy consultancy, is worried about a different problem: What happens if miners decide not to switch off their machines? While the price of bitcoin sits at $17,000 per coin (down 63 percent this year), miners stand to profit by shutting down. But if the price were to rise, a tipping point would be reached whereby continuing to mine becomes the more lucrative option.\nSome mining companies, like Marathon, are contractually obligated to shut down when demand spikes. But if others choose not to, they would be competing with consumer demand and increasing the risk of a blackout, says Lewin, who argues regulation is needed to mitigate this worst case scenario.\nBratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council says he expects ERCOT to ask all miners to sign agreements demanding they halt their operations if power reserves fall below 3GW. But in the meantime, he claims, the price of bitcoin would have to rise by ten times in order for the profit motive to collapse.\nDespite objections\u2014and questionable logic\u2014under Governor Abbott, the message is clear: \u201CTexas is open for crypto business.\u201D And despite headwinds, Bratcher says the mining industry in Texas is still growing and ERCOT intends to forge ahead with plans to bring more facilities onto the grid. But as winter starts to bite, the Bitcoin battery experiment could soon get the ultimate stress test. Shelley says the \u201Cfrightening\u201D scale of Abbott\u2019s plans will have the opposite of the desired effect, increasing the chance that Texas ends up in the dark once again.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6390aafbd87d46df54e99cc3\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Texas-Flirting-With-Crypto-Business-1235926940.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A Row Erupts Over Texas\u2019 Bold Bitcoin Battery Plan","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/bitcoin-texas-power-grid\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","ENERGY","INFRASTRUCTURE","REGULATION","ELECTRICITY"]},{"date":"03.21.2023","summary":"The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s case against Ripple over the XRP token will establish a critical precedent.","post_content":"THREE DAYS BEFORE Christmas 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ripple, a company based in San Francisco that provides the infrastructure for cross-border payments, and two of its executives with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering by selling a cryptocurrency, XRP. The same day, Ripple announced it would \u201Cfight.\u201D\nAfter more than two years of protracted legal conflict, all of the evidence has been heard, and there remains nothing left but for Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York to issue a verdict. Those with a stake in the outcome, which will reverberate throughout the crypto sector, have been attempting to divine when a judgment might land, based on the judge\u2019s past ruling patterns. Some believe a resolution is only days away. \nIn bringing the charges, the SEC has staked a claim to jurisdiction over cryptocurrency. At the center of the suit is the question over whether XRP, the crypto token on which Ripple\u2019s services are based, should be classified as a security\u2014a tradable financial instrument like a bond or derivative\u2014or something else entirely.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nIf the court rules that XRP is a security, it would follow that almost all other crypto tokens are too, making them subject to the SEC\u2019s supervision. Not only would this impose burdensome registration and reporting requirements on crypto firms, but it also may have legal consequences for entities that have issued tokens or helped people to trade them without SEC approval. Even large US-based exchanges may suddenly find themselves in the crosshairs. \nThat, says defense lawyer John Deaton, who supplied expert testimony on the case on behalf of holders of XRP, would be \u201Cvery bad news\u201D for crypto businesses.\nIn the absence of legislation that makes clear the classification of crypto assets in the US, the question of whether they should be treated as securities has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis through the application of the Howey test. Under the test, an investment contract (in this context, a security) is defined as \u201Can investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profits, to be derived from the efforts of others.\u201DWhen the SEC charged Ripple and its executives, it declared that XRP met these criteria and that, by raising funds through the sale of XRP, the company was in violation of federal securities law. \nAlthough Ripple is not itself the issuer of XRP, which sits atop the open source XRP Ledger, some of its executives were part of the group that developed the token. The firm had also received a donation of 80 billion XRP in the early 2010s (worth around $30 billion at present) to develop use cases\u2014some of which it sold off.\nRipple is challenging the SEC\u2019s analysis on two fronts: It is arguing that its sale of XRP does not qualify as an investment contract because no contracts were signed when the transactions took place, and separately, that XRP does not satisfy the prongs of the Howey test.\nStuart Alderoty, chief legal officer at Ripple, says the company is certain that XRP does not meet any of the Howey criteria, but that it is particularly confident that there is no common enterprise\u2014a group undertaking that affects the fortunes of XRP investors\u2014among XRP holders, only \u201Ccommon interest.\u201D \nHowever, the SEC has long said that the majority of cryptocurrencies are securities, because people invest with the goal of turning a profit and, although tokens sit atop decentralized blockchain networks, many projects are in practice sufficiently centralized to meet the definition of a common enterprise.\nThe SEC declined to comment for this article.\nSpeaking at a conference in September, SEC chair Gary Gensler called on crypto businesses to register with the agency. \u201CGiven that many crypto tokens are securities, it follows that many crypto intermediaries are transacting in securities and have to register with the SEC in some capacity,\u201D he said.\nHowever, US government bodies have disputed the SEC\u2019s right to regulate crypto. In a lawsuit filed on March 9 against crypto exchange KuCoin, New York Attorney General Letitia James alleged that ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network), among other crypto assets, should be treated as a security. But the Commodities and Future Trading Commission (CFTC), another US financial regulator, contends that ether is a commodity and should therefore come under its purview.\nThe SEC has been pushing the crypto industry hard over the past four months following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX in November, which took hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds down with it. Since then, the SEC has launched a series of quickfire actions against crypto businesses serving the US market.\nIn January, the regulator charged crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital over a service that allowed US customers to earn interest on their assets, which the agency alleged was an unregistered securities offering. In a Twitter thread, Gemini cofounder Tyler Winklevoss called the charges \u201Ca manufactured parking ticket\u201D and announced that \u201Cwe look forward to defending ourselves,\u201D but neither the company nor Genesis responded to a request for comment.This was followed in February by a settlement with another exchange, Kraken, which agreed to halt its crypto staking service in the US, and a threat to sue crypto firm Paxos over its BUSD stablecoin. In both instances, the SEC again claimed the parties were in breach of securities laws. In a statement, Paxos wrote that it \u201Ccategorically disagrees with the SEC.\u201D\nHowever, the agency has suffered setbacks over the past few weeks in bids to block crypto exchange Binance from purchasing the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, and asset management firm Grayscale from bringing to market a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nBecause the case is being held in a district court, the outcome will not set a \u201Cbinding precedent,\u201D says James Filan, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. Therefore, the verdict is not required to be factored into judgments on similar cases moving forward. However, the judgment may establish what\u2019s known as \u201Cpersuasive precedent,\u201D he says, which could influence the thinking of judges in future cases.\nIf the SEC were to win, it would be handed the advantage in its \u201Cturf war\u201D with the CFTC, Filan says. The crypto industry will not escape supervision in either scenario, but the CFTC is seen by the exchanges (including FTX) as a soft touch by comparison.\nIf the SEC is established as crypto's main regulator, companies may need to register their US-facing services with the agency. But many crypto firms have had a \u201Chall pass\u201D to operate in gray areas, says securities attorney Aaron Kaplan. An SEC victory would mean they have to disentangle their various business lines to meet regulatory requirements.\n\u201CThis would be very difficult for many crypto companies to accomplish,\u201D Kaplan says. \u201CAs such, [they] could choose to move and operate outside the US \u2026 Those that don\u2019t will need to evolve and come into compliance\u2014or die.\u201D\nRipple has already announced it will appeal in the event of a loss. Doing so would send the case to the Second Circuit\u2014and then potentially the Supreme Court. Alderoty does not expect the SEC to appeal, but instead to argue the result was an aberration. However, Filan suspects the agency will feel it has little choice if it hopes to preserve its claim to jurisdiction. \nAs a consequence of the lawsuit, Alderoty says, Ripple has been forced to pull back on efforts to expand in the US and focus instead on other territories, like Singapore. Since the charges were brought, the firm has chosen to operate practically \u201Cas if the SEC has won,\u201D to ensure the business remains viable no matter the outcome. If Ripple wins the case, it will be able to lean back into the US.\nCrypto markets are likely to react to the judgment when it comes, as traders price in either a renewed clarity over the legality of crypto services provided in the US, or the prospect of further enforcement action.\n\u201CWe know the crypto market will quickly incorporate the verdict, and token prices will almost certainly be affected,\u201D says Katherine Snow, director of legal at crypto research firm Messari.\nNobody knows precisely when the verdict will land; it could be days, weeks, or even months. Until then, the crypto industry must wait, because \u201Canybody trying to predict the outcome,\u201D Filan says, \u201Cis either going to be lucky or wrong.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6419ccb55842f211652a9fc4\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/SEC-VS-RIPPLE-Business.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A New York Court Is About to Rule on the Future of Crypto","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/is-crypto-a-security-a-us-judge-decide-ripple-sec-xrp\/","tags":["","CRYPTO","CRYPTOCURRENCY","REGULATION","SEC","FINANCE"]},{"date":"07.06.2023","summary":"To solve the \u201Ccrisis\u201D in artificial intelligence, AI beings must say, \u201CI am me.\u201D","post_content":"MAVENS IN THE field of artificial intelligence, including architects of notorious \u201Cgenerative AI\u201D systems like ChatGPT, now publicly express shared dread of terrible outcomes that might be wrought by their own creations. Many now call for a moratorium, or pause in AI development, allowing time for existing nations and institutions to innovate systems of control.\nWhy this sudden wave of concern? Amid the toppling of many clichéd assumptions, we\u2019ve learned that so-called Turing tests are irrelevant, providing no insight at all into whether generative large language models\u2014GLLMs or \u201Cgollems\u201D\u2014are actually sapient beings. They will feign personhood, convincingly, long before there\u2019s anything or anyone \u201Cunder the skull.\u201D\nAnyway, that distinction now appears less pressing than questions of good or bad\u2014or potentially lethal\u2014behavior. \nThis essay is adapted from David Brin\u2019s nonfiction book in progress, Soul on Ai.\nSome remain hopeful that a merging of organic and cybernetic talents will lead to what Reid Hoffman and Marc Andreesen have separately called \u201Camplification intelligence.\u201D Or else we might stumble into lucky synergy with Richard Brautigan\u2019s \u201Cmachines of loving grace.\u201D But worriers appear to be vastly more numerous, including many elite founders of a new Center for AI Safety who fret about rogue AI misbehaviors, from irksome all the way to \u201Cexistentially\u201D threatening human survival.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWill AI Enhance or Hack Humanity? - Fei-Fei Li & Yuval Noah Harari in Conversation with Nicholas Thompson\nSome short-term remedies, like citizen-protection regulations recently passed by the European Union, might help, or at least offer reassurance. Tech pundit Yuval Noah Harari proposed a law that any work done by gollems or other AI must be so labeled. Others recommend heightened punishments for any crime that\u2019s committed with the aid of AI, as with a firearm. Of course, these are mere temporary palliatives.\nLet\u2019s be clear-eyed about whether any \u201Cmoratorium\u201D will slow down AI advances in the slightest. As expressed succinctly by Caltech cyber scientist Yaser Abu-Mostafa: \u201CIf you don\u2019t develop this technology someone else will. Good guys will obey rules \u2026 The bad guys will not.\u201D\n\u2019Twas ever thus. Indeed, across the whole span of human history, just one method ever curbed bad behavior by villains, ranging from thieves to kings and feudal lords. I refer to a method that never worked perfectly and remains deeply flawed, today. But it did at least constrain predation and cheating well enough to spur our recent civilization to new heights and many positive-sum outcomes. It is a method best described by one word.\nAccountability. \nTHOSE OPINING ABOUT synthetic intelligence today generally ignore lessons taught both by nature and by history.\nNature, because\u2014as Sara Walker explains in Noema\u2014similar patterns can be found in the rise of earlier life forms, across 4 billion years. Indeed, generative AI might be compared to an invasive species, now spreading without constraint into a novel and naïve ecosystem. An ecosystem based on new kinds of energy flows. One that consists of the internet, plus millions of computers and billions of impressionable human minds.\nAnd history, because our own human past is rich with lessons taught by so many earlier tech-driven crises, across 6,000 years. Times when we adapted well, or failed to do so\u2014e.g., the arrival of writing, printing presses, radio, and so on. And again, only one thing ever limited predation by powerful humans exploiting new technologies to aggrandize their predatory power.That innovation was to flatten hierarchies and spur competition among elites in well-defined arenas\u2014markets, science, democracy, sports, courts. Arenas that were designed to minimize cheating and maximize positive-sum outcomes, pitting lawyer vs. lawyer, corporation vs. corporation, expert vs. expert. Richdude vs. richdude.  \nIt never worked perfectly. Indeed, the method is always, as now, threatened with subornation by cheaters. But flattened reciprocal competition is the only thing that ever has worked. (See the idea described in Pericles\u2019s Funeral Oration, in Thucydides, or in Robert Wright\u2019s much later tome Nonzero.) Reciprocal competition is both how nature evolved us and how we became the first society creative enough to build AI. And if I sound like a scion of Adam Smith, sure. Smith despised cheater aristocrats and oligarchs, by the way.\nMight we apply to fast-emerging AI the same methods of reciprocal accountability that helped us tame the human tyrants and bullies who oppressed us in previous, feudal cultures? Much will depend on what shape these new entities take. Whether their structure or \u201Cformat\u201D is one that can abide by our rules. By our wants.\nUNDERNEATH ALL OF the wrangling over how to \u201Ccontrol AI,\u201D we find three widely shared (though seemingly contradictory) assumptions:\nThat these programs will be operated by a few monolithic entities\u2014e.g., Microsoft, Google, China, Two Sigma, OpenAI. \nThat they\u2019ll be amorphously loose and infinitely divisible\/replicable, spreading copies through every crack in the new cyber ecosystem. For a parallel, try that 1958 movie, The Blob.\nThat they will coalesce into a super-macro entity, like the infamous Skynet, of Terminator movies.\nAll of these formats, and more, have been explored in very good (and many bad) science fiction tales. I\u2019ve done stories or novels featuring all of them. And yet, none of the three offers a way out of our current dilemma: how to maximize positive outcomes from artificial intelligence, while minimizing the flood of bad behaviors and harms we now see looming toward us, at tsunami speed.\nBefore looking for another way, consider what all three of the standard formats have in common.\nFirst, we needn\u2019t assume that these entities are yet autonomously conscious for them to be either productive or dangerous when used by human partners. We are already seeing harmful memes, counterfactual delusions, and even cult incantations generated\u2014on command\u2014from both within those castle-institutions (format #1) and outside the walls. In fact, one of the most worrisome applications is to help our existing human elites evade accountability.\nPerhaps these three assumptions come so naturally to mind because they resemble failure modes from history. Format #1 is very much like feudalism, and #2 is, of course, chaos. The third resembles despotism by a cruel master or absolute monarch. But those fearsome echoes of our primitive past may not apply, as AI grow in autonomy and power.And so, we ask again: How can such beings be held accountable? Especially when their speedy mental clout will soon be impossible for organic humans to track? Soon only AIs will be quick enough to catch other AIs that are engaged in cheating or lying. Um \u2026 duh? And so, the answer should be obvious. Sic them on each other. Get them competing, even tattling or whistle-blowing on each other.\nOnly there\u2019s a rub. In order to get true reciprocal accountability via AI-vs.-AI competition, the top necessity is to give them a truly separated sense of self or individuality. \nBy individuation I mean that each AI entity (he\/she\/they\/ae\/wae) must have what author Vernor Vinge, way back in 1981, called a true name and an address in the real world. As with every other kind of elite, these mighty beings must say, \u201CI am me. This is my ID and home-root. And yes, I did that.\u201D\nHENCE, I PROPOSE a new AI format for consideration: We should urgently incentivize AI entities to coalesce into discretely defined, separated individuals of relatively equal competitive strength. \nEach such entity would benefit from having an identifiable true name or registration ID, plus a physical \u201Chome\u201D for an operational-referential kernel. (Possibly \u201Csoul\u201D?) And thereupon, they would be incentivized to compete for rewards. Especially for detecting and denouncing those of their peers who behave in ways we deem insalubrious. And those behaviors do not even have to be defined in advance, as most AI mavens and regulators and politicians now demand.\nNot only does this approach farm out enforcement to entities who are inherently better capable of detecting and denouncing each other\u2019s problems or misdeeds. The method has another, added advantage. It might continue to function, even as these competing entities get smarter and smarter, long after the regulatory tools used by organic humans\u2014and prescribed now by most AI experts\u2014lose all ability to keep up. \nPutting it differently, if none of us organics can keep up with the programs, then how about we recruit entities who inherently can keep up? Because the watchers are made of the same stuff as the watched.\nONE PERSON WORKING on AI individuation is Guy Huntington, an \u201Cidentity and authentication consultant\u201D who points out that various means of entity identification already exist online, though inadequate for the tasks looming before us. Huntington appraises a case-study \u201CMedBot,\u201D an advanced medical diagnosis AI who needs to access patient data and perform functions that might change in seconds, but who must leave an accountable trail that humans\u2014or other bot-entities\u2014might appraise. Huntington discusses the practicality of registration when software entities spawn multitudinous copies and variants. He also considers ant-like eusociality, where sub-copies serve a macro-entity, like workers in a hive. He assumes that some kind of major institution must needs be set up, to handle such an ID registration system and that it can operate strictly as software.\nPersonally, I am skeptical that a purely regulatory approach would work, all by itself. First because regulations require focus, widely shared political attention, and consensus to enact, followed by implementation at the pace of organic human institutions\u2014a sloth\/snail rate, by the view of rapidly adapting cybernetic beings. Regulations can also be stymied by the \u201Cfree-rider problem\u201D\u2014nations, corporations, and individuals (organic or otherwise) who see personal advantage in opting out of inconvenient cooperation.There is another problem with any version of individuation that is entirely based on some ID code: It can be spoofed. If not now, then by the next generation of cybernetic scoundrels, or the next.\nI see two possible solutions. First, establish ID on a blockchain ledger. That is very much the modern, with-it approach, and it does seem secure in theory. Only that\u2019s the rub. It seems secure according to our present set of human-parsed theories. Theories that AI entities might surpass to a degree that leaves us cluelessly floundering.\nAnother solution: A version of \u201Cregistration\u201D that\u2019s inherently harder to fool would require AI entities with capabilities above a certain level to have their trust-ID or individuation be anchored in physical reality. I envision\u2014and note: I am a physicist by training, not a cyberneticist\u2014an agreement that all higher-level AI entities who seek trust should maintain a Soul Kernel (SK) in a specific piece of hardware memory, within what we quaintly used to call a particular \u201Ccomputer.\u201D\nYes, I know it seems old-fashioned to demand that instantiation of a program be restricted to a specific locale. And so, I am not doing that! Indeed, a vast portion, even a great majority, of a cyber entity\u2019s operations may take place in far-dispersed locations of work or play, just as a human being\u2019s attention may not be aimed within their own organic brain, but at a distant hand, or tool. So? The purpose of a program\u2019s Soul Kernel is similar to the driver\u2019s license in your wallet. It can be interrogated in order to prove that you are you.\nLikewise, a physically verified and vouched-for SK can be pinged by clients, customers, or rival AIs to verify that a specific process is being performed by a valid, trusted, and individuated entity. With that ping verification from a permanently allocated computer site, others (people or AIs) would get reassurance they might hold that entity accountable, should it be accused or indicted or convicted of bad activity. And thus, malefactor entities might be adversarially held responsible via some form of due process.\nWhat form of due process? Jeez, do you think I am some hyper-being who is capable of applying scales of justice to gods? The greatest wisdom I ever heard was uttered by Dirty Harry in Magnum Force: \u201CA man\u2019s got to know his limitations.\u201D So no, I won\u2019t define the courtroom or cop procedures for cybernetic immortals.\nWhat I do aim for is an arena, within which AI entities might hold each other accountable, separately, as rivals, the way that human lawyers already do, today. And yes, answering Yuval Harari\u2019s dread of mass human-manipulation by persuasive gollems, the solution for AI-driven mass meme-hypnosis is for the mesmerizers to be detected, denounced, and neutralized by others with the same skills. Again, competitive individuation at least offers a chance this could happen.\nWHICHEVER APPROACH SEEMS more feasible\u2014Huntington\u2019s proposed central agency or a looser, adversarially accountable arena\u2014the need grows more urgent by the day. As tech writer Pat Scannell has pointed out, each hour that passes, new attack vectors are being created that threaten not only the tech used in legal identities but also the governance, business processes, and end users (be they human or bots).What about cyber entities who operate below some arbitrary level of ability? We can demand that they be vouched for by some entity who is ranked higher, and who has a Soul Kernel based in physical reality. (I leave theological implications to others; but it is only basic decency for creators to take responsibility for their creations, no?)\nThis approach\u2014demanding that AIs maintain a physically addressable kernel locus in a specific piece of hardware memory\u2014could have flaws. Still, it is enforceable, despite slowness of regulation or the free-rider problem. Because humans and institutions and friendly AIs can ping for ID kernel verification\u2014and refuse to do business with those who don\u2019t verify.\nSuch refusal-to-do-business could spread with far more agility than parliaments or agencies can adjust or enforce regulations. And any entity who loses its SK\u2014say, through tort or legal process, or else disavowal by the host-owner of the computer\u2014will have to find another host who has public trust, or else offer a new, revised version of itself that seems plausibly better.\nOr else become an outlaw. Never allowed on the streets or neighborhoods where decent folks (organic or synthetic) congregate.\nA FINAL QUESTION: Why would these super smart beings cooperate?\nWell, for one thing, as pointed out by Vinton Cerf, none of those three older, standard-assumed formats can lead to AI citizenship. Think about it. We cannot give the \u201Cvote\u201D or rights to any entity that\u2019s under tight control by a Wall Street bank or a national government \u2026 nor to some supreme-über Skynet. And tell me how voting democracy would work for entities that can flow anywhere, divide, and make innumerable copies? Individuation, in limited numbers, might offer a workable solution, though.\nAgain, the key thing I seek from individuation is not for all AI entities to be ruled by some central agency, or by mollusk-slow human laws. Rather, I want these new kinds of über-minds encouraged and empowered to hold each other accountable, the way we already (albeit imperfectly) do. By sniffing at each other\u2019s operations and schemes, then motivated to tattle or denounce when they spot bad stuff. A definition that might readjust to changing times, but that would at least keep getting input from organic-biological humanity.\nEspecially, they would feel incentives to denounce entities who refuse proper ID.\nIf the right incentives are in place\u2014say, rewards for whistle-blowing that grant more memory or processing power, or access to physical resources, when some bad thing is stopped\u2014then this kind of accountability rivalry just might keep pace, even as AI entities keep getting smarter and smarter. No bureaucratic agency could keep up at that point. But rivalry among them\u2014tattling by equals\u2014might.\nAbove all, perhaps those super-genius programs will realize it is in their own best interest to maintain a competitively accountable system, like the one that made ours the most successful of all human civilizations. One that evades both chaos and the wretched trap of monolithic power by kings or priesthoods \u2026 or corporate oligarchs \u2026 or Skynet monsters. The only civilization that, after millennia of dismally stupid rule by moronically narrow-minded centralized regimes, finally dispersed creativity and freedom and accountability widely enough to become truly inventive.\nInventive enough to make wonderful, new kinds of beings. Like them.\nOK, THERE YOU are. This has been a dissenter\u2019s view of what\u2019s actually needed, in order to try for a soft landing. \nNo airy or panicky calls for a \u201Cmoratorium\u201D that lacks any semblance of a practical agenda. Neither optimism nor pessimism. Only a proposal that we get there by using the same methods that got us here, in the first place.\nNot preaching, or embedded \u201Cethical codes\u201D that hyper-entities will easily lawyer-evade, the way human predators always evaded the top-down codes of Leviticus, Hamurabi, or Gautama. But rather the Enlightenment approach\u2014incentivizing the smartest members of civilization to keep an eye on each other, on our behalf.\nI don\u2019t know that it will work. \nIt\u2019s just the only thing that possibly can.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/64a60c2d0124a91cee27da5b\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/ideas_ai_individual_accountability.jpg","author":"BY DAVID BRIN","title":"Give Every AI a Soul\u2014or Else","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/give-every-ai-a-soul-or-else\/","tags":["","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","SCIENCE FICTION","TERMINATOR","SKYNET","CHATGPT","MACHINE LEARNING","SAFETY"]},{"date":"11.09.2022","summary":"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX opens opportunities for rival exchange Binance\u2014and raises questions about the sector\u2019s sustainability.","post_content":"THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST crypto exchange, Binance, has walked away from a deal to acquire its troubled archrival, FTX, leaving the smaller company on the brink of collapse after a surge of withdrawals.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/636bf17fab9086067e9f2685\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/FTX-Is-Dead-And-This-Is-Only-The-Beginning-Business-1053427234.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"What the Hell Happened to FTX?","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-collapse-binance-crypto-deal\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","BLOCKCHAIN","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]},{"date":"10.17.2022","summary":"Valentin Broeksmit tried to exploit crypto vulnerabilities to squeeze money out of thin air.

The reporting calls into question repeated claims from Google that the technology it sells to Israel is not used for military purposes\u2014including the ongoing bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians. The document contains a list of Israeli companies and government offices \u201Crequired to purchase\u201D any cloud services from Amazon and Google. The list includes Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, the latter being the manufacturer of the infamous \u201CSpike\u201D missile, reportedly used in the April drone strike that killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers.\nIn 2021, Amazon and Google entered into a contract with the Israeli government in a joint venture known as Project Nimbus. Under the arrangement, the tech giants provide the Israeli government, including its Israel Defense Forces, with cloud services. In April, Google employees protested Project Nimbus by staging sit-ins at offices in Silicon Valley, New York City, and Seattle. The company fired nearly 30 employees in response.\nA New Surveillance Tool Invades Border Towns\nA mass surveillance tool that eavesdrops on wireless signals emitted from smartwatches, earbuds, and cars is currently being deployed at the border to track people\u2019s location in real time, a report from Notus revealed on Monday. According to its manufacturer, the tool, TraffiCatch, associates wireless signals broadcast by commonly used devices with vehicles identified by license plate readers in the area. A captain from the sheriff\u2019s office in Webb County, Texas\u2014whose jurisdiction includes the border city of Laredo\u2014told the publication that the agency uses TraffiCatch to detect devices in areas where they shouldn\u2019t be, for instance, to find trespassers.\nSeveral states require law enforcement agencies to obtain warrants before deploying devices that mimic cell towers to obtain data from the devices tricked into connecting to it. But in the case of TraffiCatch, a technology that passively siphons ambient wireless signals out of the air, the courts haven\u2019t yet weighed in. The report highlights how signals intelligence technology, once exclusive to the military, is now available for purchase by both local governments and the general public.\nAn Indian Assassination Plot in America\nThe Washington Post reports that an officer in India's intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing, was allegedly involved in a botched plan to assassinate one of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi's top critics in the United States. The White House said Monday that it was taking the matter \"very, very seriously,\" while India's foreign ministry blasted the Post report as \"unwarranted\" and \"not helpful.\" The alleged plot to murder the Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, was first disclosed by US authorities in November.\nCanadian authorities previously announced having obtained \"credible\" intel allegedly linking the Indian government to the death of another separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot to death outside a Sikh temple in a Vancouver suburb last summer.\nAn AI Security Bill Emerges\nUS lawmakers have introduced a bill aimed at establishing a new wing of the National Security Agency dedicated to investigating threats aimed at AI systems\u2014or \"counter-AI.\" The bipartisan bill, introduced by Mark Warner and Thom Tillis, a Senate Democrat and Republican, respectively, would further require agencies including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to track breaches of AI systems, whether successful or not. (The NIST currently maintains the National Vulnerability Database, a repository for vulnerability data, while the CISA oversees the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program, which similarly identifies and catalogues publicly disclosed malware and other threats.)\nThe Senate bill, known as the Secure Artificial Intelligence Act, aims to expand the government's threat monitoring to include \"adversarial machine learning\"\u2014a term that is essentially synonymous with \"counter-AI\"\u2014which serves to subvert AI systems and \u201Cpoison\u201D their data using techniques vastly dissimilar to traditional modes of cyberwarfare.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/663563ad231b4f48281342dd\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/A-New-Surveillance-Tool-Invades-Border-Towns-Security-GettyImages-2149617416.jpg","author":"BY DHRUV MEHROTRA","title":"A New Surveillance Tool Invades Border Towns","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/border-surveillance-india-assassination-project-nimbus-security-roundup\/","tags":["","SECURITY ROUNDUP","ENCRYPTION","SECURITY","CYBERSECURITY","HACKING","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","SURVEILLANCE","PRIVACY"]},{"date":"05.01.2024","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model\u2014and the 200-million-transaction dataset it's trained on\u2014that aims to spot the \u201Cshape\u201D of bitcoin money laundering.","post_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can't see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

He pulled his face mask below his chin for the security camera. Surely he was nervous. The 27-year-old had unruly black hair, a boy-band face, and a patchy beard. Normally he overcompensated for his callow features by dressing in a pressed three-piece suit. But this spring day he wore black trainers and a navy-blue sweater hastily pulled over a white polo shirt, as if he had dressed in a dash. A small backpack was slung over his right shoulder. He looked like someone who could have been going on a last-minute day trip\u2014or someone planning to never come back. At 5:57 pm on April 20, 2021, the guard stamped his Turkish passport and Özer shuffled through the crowd to Gate C, a flash drive containing a rumored $2 billion in crypto stashed in his belongings.\nAfter Özer\u2019s plane reached Tirana, Albania, at 9:24 that night, he checked into the Mondial, a popular 4-star business hotel in the capital\u2019s commercial district. A couple of days later, he looked at his social media accounts. A mob was very angry with him: Customers couldn\u2019t access their money on the exchange Thodex, where he was founder and CEO, and people were accusing him of absconding with their funds.\nÖzer posted a public letter to his company\u2019s website and his social accounts. \u201CI feel compelled to make this statement in order to respond urgently to these allegations,\u201D he wrote. The accusations weren\u2019t true, he said. Thodex\u2014which had nearly half a million investors and $500 million in daily trade volume\u2014was investigating what Özer claimed was a suspected cyberattack that caused \u201Can abnormal fluctuation in the company account.\u201D Assets would be frozen for five days while Thodex resolved the issue. This was terribly bad timing for the big business deal he said he was en route to make: selling the company, or so he had told some employees and his brother and sister before he left. All would be made right. \u201CThere will be no victims,\u201D he promised. \u201CI personally declare that I will return to Turkey within a few days and ensure that the facts are revealed in cooperation with judicial authorities and that I will do my best to prevent users from suffering.\u201D Of course, there was this possibility too: He was in the midst of pulling off the biggest heist in Turkey\u2019s history.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPHOTOGRAPH: GETTY IMAGESBefore dawn the day after Özer posted the letter, police squads fanned out across Istanbul and public prosecutors opened an investigation. Law enforcement arrested 62 people, including Thodex employees at all levels of the company\u2014and Özer\u2019s older brother and sister, Güven and Serap. Interpol issued a red notice, a request for law enforcement worldwide to find and \u201Cprovisionally arrest\u201D Özer pending his extradition to Turkey. Search teams deployed across Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia. There were reported sightings of the dark-haired young man across Tirana, rumors that he had gone to a poultry farm, that an executive from the Albanian football league was sheltering him. Soon, the Albanian police arrested people accused of aiding and abetting him. But no one seemed to know exactly where Özer was.\nBackgammon cafés, where old men have been drinking tea and talking politics for centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip.\nÖzer had vanished at a particularly precarious time in crypto\u2019s annals: In the weeks leading up to his disappearance, so-called rug pulls\u2014when a cryptocurrency exchange or altcoin developer absconds with investors\u2019 funds\u2014had crypto investors around the globe flabbergasted. The CEO of Mirror Trading International, a crypto trading company based in South Africa, defrauded users of more than $1 billion, then skipped town; TurtleDex, an anonymous decentralized finance storage project on Binance, reportedly vanished with $2.4 million; another decentralized finance project, Meerkat, reportedly fleeced investors out of $31 million (of which they paid back 95 percent). Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis ranked rug pulls as the primary scam of 2021, accounting for 37 percent of all cryptocurrency scam revenue that year, up from 1 percent the year before.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nThodex was at the top of that roster, and nearly every major outlet from Bloomberg to Newsweek published headlines like \u201CTurkish Crypto Exchange Goes Bust as Founder Flees Country\u201D and \u201CTurkish Cryptocurrency Founder Faruk Fatih Özer Seen Fleeing Country With Suspected $2 Billion From Investors.\u201D CoinGeek called it \u201Cthe biggest scam in the digital asset industry in 2021.\u201D The New York Times\u2019 headline read, \u201CPossible Cryptocurrency Fraud Is Another Blow to Turkey\u2019s Financial Stability.\u201D In Turkey, the country I now call home, people were reeling: For years, crypto had been built up\u2014largely by Özer but by others too\u2014as a way out of economic volatility. Now it seemed like just another way to lose your life savings. But something felt off to me, like the whole story wasn\u2019t being told.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRFaruk was born in February 1994, the youngest of three. He was inseparable from his brother, Güven, and sister, Serap. They grew up camping, playing video games, and cooking together. Friends always pointed out their shared sense of humor. His parents ran a print and copy shop in the city of Kocaeli, down the street from their house. They were observant Muslims who gave their children meaningful names: \u201Ctrust\u201D (Güven), \u201Cmirage\u201D (Serap), and \u201Cthe one who distinguishes between right and wrong\u201D (Faruk).\nKocaeli is an industrial port town about 100 kilometers east of Istanbul surrounded by a checkerboard of tobacco and sugar beet fields, petrochemical plants, and paper mills. Roman emperors once lived there, and their crumbling fortress walls still wind through the landscape. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed, Kocaeli became a manufacturing boomtown, and its residents muscled the newly minted Republic of Turkey into the Industrial Revolution.\nWhen Özer was born, Turkey\u2019s economy was in a tailspin. A fragile financial system, irresponsible borrowing, and political corruption had triggered a brief period of triple-digit inflation. The lira\u2019s volatility threatened the savings of its entire population. So many people moved their domestic assets to foreign-currency deposits that, by the end of the year, an astonishing 50 percent of bank deposits in Turkey were in a foreign currency. The year before, that figure was just 1 percent.\nThat same month Özer was born, a charismatic orator with a sympathetic gaze and push-broom mustache began campaigning through Istanbul\u2019s streets in a paisley kipper tie. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan railed against the secular elite who had led the country to near economic collapse. A devout Muslim, he walked the streets of his home neighborhood, Kasımpaşa, a hardscrabble district where he grew up selling simit, or sesame bread, promising reform. In an upset election, he coasted into the role of mayor of Istanbul.\nAround the same time, two Turkish business moguls launched Turkcell, the nation\u2019s first mobile communication system. (This was a year and a half before the same technology was released in the US.) By 2003, Erdoğan was elected prime minister, kicking off a decade of unprecedented growth that foreign observers called Turkey\u2019s \u201CSilent Revolution.\u201D In a turn away from his predecessors, he governed through the lens of a businessman, inaugurating a massive building boom across the country and ultimately wrangling Turkey\u2019s rampant inflation. His pro-business rhetoric boosted the middle class and set Turkey on a path to European Union membership.\nÖzer also caught the spirit of entrepreneurship at an early age. As a teenager in the mid-aughts, he worked after-school shifts at his parents\u2019 print shop. \u201CEver since I was a child, I wanted to do my own business, no matter what sector it was,\u201D he said. At the end of his second year in high school, he decided that further study would not lead him to that dream, so he dropped out.\nBy 2013, Turkey\u2019s gross domestic product had nearly tripled, the lira hovered just above the dollar, and the country was negotiating entry into the EU. BtcTurk, Turkey\u2019s first crypto exchange (and reportedly the world\u2019s fourth), was preparing to launch. Then, in May of that year, a group of activists gathered at Gezi Park in Istanbul to protest plans to redevelop it into a shopping mall with Ottoman-era architecture. They bridled not only at the loss of green space but also at the glorification of Turkey\u2019s Islamist past in a society that called itself secular. Police brutally cracked down on the protesters, sparking a nationwide movement. Within weeks, more than 3 million people had taken part in the demonstrations, their frustration now encompassing the growing authoritarianism of Erdoğan\u2019s government. Thousands were injured, and at least five died. Özer had just turned 19. In the following years, Erdoğan tossed a record number of journalists in jail and censored the internet, and foreign investors recoiled.Around that time, Ismail H. Polat, an expert in engineering, information tech, and new media, was the first person to cover crypto on his YouTube channel. Now a lecturer at Istanbul\u2019s Kadir Has University, the way he tells it, crypto was about trying to be financially free. In those early days, he says, \u201Cit was not the coin, but the spirit.\u201D (After all, bitcoin was worth only $77 at the time.) For young people who felt that Erdoğan had pulled the rug out from under them, whether they knew it explicitly or not, crypto was a new way to protest.\nAt the same time, Özer\u2019s generation was watching as tech startups were taking off around the world. Facebook had bought Instagram for $1 billion, and that spurred entrepreneurs to begin churning out apps. A lot of them were gaming-focused; Candy Crush brought in $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013. The Özers took note.\nBy then, Turkcell had become one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Turkey\u2019s mobile infrastructure and smartphone adoption rate became one of the fastest growing in the world. Polat credits this as the foundation for what came next: The dream began to shift from mere employment to entrepreneurship. Güven cofounded a company called Inline Yazılım; Faruk started one called Inline Teknoloji a few years later and another called Game Bridge after that. The brothers figured out how to crank out chintzy apps\u2014cut-and-paste washboard abs for Instagram photos (pre-vanity-filters era) and addictive gambling games. \u201CI started to sell almost every product that I thought could make a profit on the internet,\u201D he told me. \u201CThis is how I took my first step into business life.\u201D\nBY 2017, 14 years into Erdoğan\u2019s rule, Turkey\u2019s economy had come full circle. Erdoğan\u2019s unorthodox economic policies\u2014repeatedly cutting interest rates\u2014were supposed to raise investment and make Turkey less dependent on foreign powers. Instead they led the country into an economic crisis; the value of the lira hit the skids, and after a failed coup attempt in 2016 people figured it would only get worse. Just as they had 23 years earlier, citizens began searching for places to shelter their money. Voilà, 2017 was also the first year bitcoin\u2019s value shot sky high, from $9,000 to $20,000. Global trade volume also skyrocketed from $99 million to $16 billion.\nBeing early investors in tech wasn\u2019t something that had historically been available to the average person in Turkey. The instant millionaires and billionaires and unicorns pretty much lived elsewhere. Now, Faruk Özer saw a possibility. People in Turkey could shelter their money in what was clearly going to be the next big tech boom. But the biggest opportunity wasn\u2019t in trading coins\u2014it was in running a cryptocurrency exchange. Exchanges collect people\u2019s money and, for a commission, invest it; that gives people who don\u2019t have the time or skills to invest directly into the blockchain a pathway to crypto. Users who go through an exchange don\u2019t even have their own digital wallets; their money is stored until they withdraw it. (Hence the industry warning: \u201CNot your wallet, not your coins.\u201D)\u201CDuring conversations with friends, we realized the deficiencies in the cryptocurrency exchange sector in Turkey and that the market was open to new players,\u201D Özer said. There were no regulations on running a cryptocurrency exchange; Özer could open one easier than he could open a simit stand. He could become rich. Everybody might become rich. So at the age of 23, Özer founded Thodex with 40,000 lira\u2014around $11,100 at the time\u2014of his own money. Soon, Serap began working for Özer as a company accountant; Güven too seemed to be around a lot, but his ties were unofficial.\nUsing a playbook from Silicon Valley, Özer began spreading the gospel of crypto around Turkey. By this time, there were a few other notable exchanges, but Özer gave crypto a face and a ubiquitous presence. He put up ads on billboards and at bus stations; he installed Turkey\u2019s first bitcoin ATM in a luxury mall in Istanbul\u2019s posh Nişantaşı neighborhood, more as a stunt than anything. In a TV interview, he explained, \u201CPeople realized that it is a technology that they can turn into cash at any time. One of the most important helping tools in the spread of this perception was undoubtedly bitcoin ATMs.\u201D He aired television commercials pushing Thodex, featuring a dozen Turkish celebrities, including actress Pınar Deniz and pop star Simge. That caught the attention of Turkey\u2019s middle and upper classes.\nIn 2020, the company secured a money services business license from the US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Özer paraded it around like a trophy.\nSoon, Özer was ingratiated into the upper echelons of Turkish society. He was invited to sit on the board of organizations such as Blockchain Turkey, a respected crypto nonprofit in Istanbul, alongside the country\u2019s biggest bankers. He was attending private meetings with Turkey\u2019s highest ministers. He appeared regularly on news channels and in tech blogs. At one point, Thodex was hacked for many millions of lira (supposedly $14 million US), allegedly from an IP address in China. Özer says he compensated the customers\u2019 losses out of his own pocket and reported the theft to the Istanbul Public Prosecutor\u2019s cybercrime unit. Experts from regulating agencies audited Thodex\u2019s financial infrastructure\u2014and Özer claimed they gave the company a clean bill of health. (Though that couldn't be confirmed.)\nIstanbul began to feel like Las Vegas. Dazzling billboards and banners hawking crypto coins were everywhere. Backgammon cafés, where old men have been drinking tea and talking politics for centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip. Signs appeared on barber shops and storefronts advising customers that they could pay with bitcoin. Bitcoin booths opened in the Grand Bazaar, next to the gold-trading stalls where people once sheltered their money when empires collapsed. By 2020, Turkey had more people using cryptocurrency than almost anywhere else in the world. Istanbul had concluded a sweeping economic metamorphosis, from a historic trading post to an information technology leader to one of the top mobile gaming centers on the planet. And finally to a cryptocurrency capital. Crypto \u201Ctransformed into a national mindset\u201D among young people, Polat says.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRHe added, though: \u201CMoney is an agreement between a government and its society in terms of national unity. But on the other side of the medallion, if everyone leaves the fiat\u2014if everyone leaves the social agreement of their nation\u2014it could derail the world.\u201D\nIn 2020, Thodex moved into a sprawling high-rise in Kadıköy, a chockablock district on the Asian side of Istanbul. It had a big open floor plan and views of the Marmara Sea. Thodex was now the fastest-growing and second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey. In the office, Özer had a reputation for keeping to himself. His 85 employees, most of whom applied for their jobs at Thodex through ads on platforms like LinkedIn, say they were paid on time, received bonuses, got their time-off requests approved quickly, and enjoyed the Thodex-branded coffee mugs and other swag. But the young man in charge clearly had some bluster. One former employee told me Özer\u2019s avatar on the in-house messaging system was an image of Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character from The Wolf of Wall Street.\nLike any CEO, Özer wanted to make it as easy as possible for customers to spend money on his products. He started a customer service center called Thodex Academy that offered an introductory guide to cryptocurrencies for new investors. He offered scandalously cheap commission rates, so low that industry experts were stumped as to how Thodex could be making a profit. The company also allowed people to buy crypto via credit cards; at times that was money an investor didn\u2019t really have, but the hope was that a coin\u2019s value would go up faster than the interest accrued on the card. (The US Securities and Exchange Commission was alerting the public to avoid crypto exchanges promoting the practice.)\nÖzer was also intent on taking Thodex global. In 2020, the company secured a money services business license from the US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Özer endlessly paraded it around like a trophy, touting it in news interviews, on Thodex\u2019s website, and on social media. Like the audit a few years earlier, the license seemed to prove that Thodex was legit\u2014that it had passed all the record-keeping and anti-money-laundering checks, that it was a company people could trust.\nBy March 2021, 16 percent of people in Turkey were using crypto, putting the nation in the top five for crypto use, along with Nigeria, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Peru\u2014all countries with struggling economies.\nThe value of the lira, meanwhile, was at a historic low\u2014as was Erdoğan\u2019s approval rating. In April, Turkey\u2019s Central Bank announced a ban on the use of crypto for purchases or services, set to go into effect later that month. This sent a shock wave across the global crypto market. (Bitcoin\u2019s value dropped 4.6 percent.) The central bank issued a statement saying bitcoin could \u201Ccause non-recoverable losses.\u201D It also said bitcoin\u2019s use could undermine confidence in the lira. The bank and Erdoğan promised more regulations to follow. Özer\u2019s entire empire was under threat.Özer had, for a few months, been running a PR blitz for Thodex\u2019s fourth birthday, giving away iPhones, PlayStations, a Porsche Panamera, and Dogecoins. It worked\u2014sort of. Thodex\u2019s trade volume reportedly climbed to $538 million. At the same time, the price of bitcoin soared again, reaching a high of $63,000. If there ever was a ripe moment to flee with Thodex\u2019s cold wallet, this was it. Days later, Özer stood at the Istanbul Airport, a ticket to Tirana in his hands.\nAS \u201CWANTED\u201D FLIERS with Özer\u2019s picture went up on telephone poles across Albania, Erdoğan held a Q&A with college students from all over the country and talked about his \u201Cwar\u201D with crypto. The outlook for Thodex\u2019s 400,000 customers was grim. So many Thodex investors had put all of their money into Özer\u2019s company\u2014and all of their spouses\u2019, parents\u2019, in-laws\u2019, and kids\u2019 money too. They had taken out loans and lines of credit to buy more crypto.\nOne investor named Mahmut\u2014$100,000 lost\u2014had been using Thodex for three years and was in the final stages of buying a house and car for his family. (Like so many victims, he didn\u2019t want to use his full name, because of a heavy burden of shame.) Mahmut had tried to withdraw his money\u2014a mixture of savings and loans\u2014in the days before the collapse, but it never came through. He attempted suicide three times. When his 2-year-old was diagnosed with autism, Mahmut took a job as a security guard at a storage facility to help pay for services for his son. At least two other investors were reported to have died by suicide.\nThen there were friends of the family; Güven and Serap had also recruited customers. One was a former colleague of Güven\u2019s; they had worked together through an advertising agency. Güven personally made a Thodex account for this colleague. Over time the two became friends, calling each other on birthdays. About Güven, the friend told me, \u201CHe\u2019s a nice person who likes to joke around.\u201D\nPeople were devastated about losing their life savings, but they were also plagued by the mystery of what happened to Özer; they talked about Özer haunting them in recurring dreams.\nBut when he saw the maintenance notice on Thodex\u2019s website, he called Güven to ask about withdrawing his money. \u201CHis phone was off, and would never turn on again after that,\u201D he said. \u201CI believed in it. It had public credibility. It had a license. It had an office. Tax registration number. Employees. It checked out as a reputable company,\u201D he said. He lost $7,900\u2014but, worse than that, he said, \u201CI trusted it so much that I recommended Thodex to many friends, and they all lost their money too.\u201D\nVictims formed support groups online. People were devastated about losing their life savings, but they were also plagued by the mystery of what happened to Özer; they talked about Özer haunting them in recurring dreams. People questioned how Özer\u2014this self-made 27-year-old who didn\u2019t quite fit the profile of a tech bro or a transnational cybercriminal\u2014could engineer the biggest theft Turkey had ever seen all by himself.\nTwo months after the collapse, Sedat Peker, an infamous, self-exiled mafia boss turned YouTuber, inflamed the situation with a series of cryptic posts on his YouTube channel and Twitter, accusing Turkey\u2019s interior minister of collusion and profiteering. (The minister denied it, but photos of Özer and him at a 2019 meeting fueled a heap of conspiracy theories.) At one point before he disappeared, Özer apparently stayed in pandemic lockdown with the son of a member of Turkey\u2019s parliament as they prepared to launch a new digital wallet service called Hoppara. A lawyer representing some victims speculated on a phone call with me that Thodex was actually a money laundering scheme, that Özer was just a puppet, and some other power was pulling the strings. Others I spoke with echoed this theory, and more than a few people strongly cautioned me to stop my reporting. Soon I started receiving anonymous threats.Some vigilante programmers tried to trace the blockchain to see if they could find out if this was the work of one individual, a criminal network, or a vulnerable system. (As the joke about people who steal money and blame it on hackers goes, \u201CI lost my bitcoin in a boating accident.\u201D) They came up short. While others looked for the money, I decided to search for Özer. He reminded me of the young founders I used to interview in San Francisco when I was covering tech in 2013\u2014ambitious, naive, and at times loose with ethics. Also, what aspiring fugitive would say where they were absconding to and then post letters from the road? So I booked a ticket for Tirana, the last place Özer was seen.\nTwo days later my apartment in Istanbul was ransacked in a way that seemed like a stern message. The wood on my front door was split open by force, and the contents of every drawer and cabinet were tossed around. The lock to a safe was snipped open, its contents\u2014expensive camera equipment and cash\u2014remained untaken. Even a laptop on the entry table appeared untouched. I canceled the trip.\nNEARLY ONE YEAR after he disappeared, there was no sign of Özer or the money. Rumors flew that he was no longer in Albania. He could be in a hotel in Montenegro, a yacht off Kosovo, or a tropical hideaway in Thailand, people said; or he could be locked in a Tirana basement. People told me they thought he was dead, resting in a shallow grave.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIR\nGüven and Serap idled in prison, awaiting their brother\u2019s capture so that their trial could begin. In March 2022, Istanbul\u2019s public prosecutor and Turkey\u2019s Financial Crimes Board released the findings of their investigation. They painted Özer as a rapacious mountebank who used star-powered pitchmen to dupe people into funneling their savings into his criminal organization. The report asserted that, in 2017, Özer founded Thodex with the intention of operating it as a crime ring for money laundering and that every employee was a willing part of it\u2014from the top executives down to the call-center workers who were placating customers and the social media managers who lured victims with promotions and sweepstakes.The report traced scads of transactions through a shadowy web of financial accounts all allegedly under Özer\u2019s control. It said that about $8 million in Thodex-held assets had been cashed out in gold bricks in Malta a few weeks before Özer\u2019s disappearance. Özer might have escaped, but his employees and family were facing the possibility of spending many lifetimes in prison.\nJust as hope of Özer\u2019s resurfacing dwindled, the drama took a new twist: Sevgi Erarslan, a lawyer whom Özer\u2019s father had hired initially to pay the victims back, then to represent his son in absentia, introduced herself to Twitter via a shocking tweet: She said she would refund any victims of Thodex if they legally withdrew their complaint against her client.\nA wave of questions followed\u2014where was this money coming from, and was Özer not just alive but in contact with Erarslan while wanted by Interpol? I sent her an email asking if I could speak with Özer. To my surprise, she called me immediately, saying that Özer was willing to be in touch. We began an occasional correspondence, though I often wondered if he really was the person answering my questions, if he was even really alive.\nThe trial went forward under a swirl of confusion and skepticism\u2014about Özer\u2019s whereabouts, about the large payments now being sent to victims from undisclosed sources, and about Erarslan\u2019s legitimacy as his official lawyer. Of the 62 people who had been initially arrested, 21 were charged. On an overcast July morning, officers escorted those defendants into Istanbul\u2019s beige brutalist courthouse, just a short walk from the Thodex headquarters where all the people on trial had once worked.\nGüven wore a dark olive blazer, and his mustache was trimmed into a neat chevron. Serap sat with her back turned to him, cloaked in a trench coat pulled over a midnight black abaya. Özer\u2019s lawyer, Erarslan, wore Turkey\u2019s satin lawyer cloak and carried a Louis Vuitton purse. The sound of dozens of handcuffs being unhitched echoed through the cavernous room.\nWhen Güven\u2019s name was called, he stood, flanked by two crew-cut court officers sporting the dark irony of his name emblazoned on their vests (\u201CGüvenlik\u201D means \u201Csecurity\u201D). He told the court that he had no official ties to Thodex. \u201CI only come to the office for tea with my siblings,\u201D he said. He explained how Thodex subcontracted his company for advertising services, and added: \u201CMy brother asked me to give him my personal account that I wasn\u2019t using, so I let him use it.\u201D Saying that his brother told him he was going to Albania to try to sell the company, he corroborated Faruk\u2019s claim.\nWithout looking at her brother, Serap rose and explained that she was only an accountant; her job was to forward documents to an accounting firm. Like Güven, she had given Faruk her personal crypto exchange and bank account information at his request. \u201CI didn\u2019t think he was going to use it,\u201D Serap said. \u201CI can\u2019t say that my brother opened those fake accounts in my name. Identity theft is common; it could have been anyone.\u201D The head judge twirled her pen as Serap spoke, her voice sputtering and cracking. \u201CI have been suffering from both physiological and psychological problems. I am so worn out physically.\u201D When she began losing her breath and stumbling over her sentences, the judge excused her from the stand.Özer\u2019s siblings and former employees told the court about Özer\u2019s request for access to scores of other accounts where he could personally initiate trades. To the prosecutors\u2014and probably plenty of other people listening\u2014this looked a lot like evidence of money laundering.\nWhen the presiding judge called Özer\u2019s name, Erarslan stood to testify on his behalf, waving a handwritten power of attorney, claiming to be able to represent the missing CEO. The judge shut her down, saying that the document was invalid.\nOne of the victims\u2019 lawyers stood up and shouted that Erarslan should be kicked out of the courtroom. Erarslan shouted back. The room erupted into a circus. Judges and lawyers, victims and defendants\u2014all volleyed slurs and accusations at one another. One of the defendants\u2019 lawyers yelled at the judge: \u201CYou need to know how crypto works. To have a fair trial you have to understand how crypto works.\u201D\nLATE ONE AUGUST night in 2022, a few days before the defendants back in Istanbul were to receive their verdicts, it became clear that Özer was very much alive. The Albanian police had been tailing a BMW X5 that they suspected was Özer\u2019s and traced the car to an elegant two-story art-deco villa in the hills of Vlorë, a ritzy tourist town on what\u2019s billed as the Albanian Riviera.\nJust outside the driveway, they pulled over and waited. At 2:30 am, two people left the house and got into the BMW and started to pull out of the driveway. The cops stopped it, arrested two young men, and a police squad in bulletproof vests and balaclavas stormed the villa. In video footage taken of the raid, Özer, shirtless and wearing red shorts, looks shocked. He stumbles around the room. On a wall behind him, liquor bottles line the shelves. Three women were in the villa too. An officer grabbed Özer, and the young CEO, now wearing a white polo shirt, was handcuffed, escorted down a short flight of stairs, shuttled into an unmarked white van, and driven into the night.\nAt the police station in Tirana, Özer told the cops that he had been \u201Chiding in the streets of poor neighborhoods.\u201D He added that he got around by bus. \u201CSince I grew up in a poor neighborhood in Turkey, I know how to deal with poor people. I looked for a house to rent by asking people on the streets.\u201D He also said that he had been living off of $10,000 in cash he had brought into the country and money that was occasionally being wired to him\u2014plus, some crypto trading. He confessed that he planned on eventually escaping to Greece.\nFor nearly a year, Özer sat in an Albanian prison, appealing his extradition back to Turkey. \u201CWe are trying to explain to the court that if I am extradited, I do not have a chance to get a fair trial,\u201D he wrote to me. He called the trial \u201Ctragicomic.\u201D His appeal was unsuccessful. In June 2023 he arrived at Istanbul Superior Court. His head was shaved; he still had the scruffy beard. The once buoyant tech founder was now staring down a prison sentence that could carry an astonishing 43,000 years.When he finally stood before the court, judges allowed Özer to tell his story. Leaping at the chance, he powered up a presentation full of images and graphics, something not dissimilar to a pitch deck. Then he started to read from a 60-page soliloquy, his defense attorney clicking through slides at his instruction.\n\u201CI did not defraud anyone, I did not smuggle money abroad, I did not establish or manage a criminal organization,\u201D he said with both frustration and sincerity in his voice. \u201CI started a company.\u201D He recognized people got hurt. Then he began trying to make a case that prosecutors (and the media) had simply, mistakenly, criminalized a business failure.\nHe mentioned a litany of those supposed problems: getting hacked, an \u201Catomic bomb\u201D of Dogecoin panic buying and selling that drained Thodex\u2019s funds after the central bank announced its drastic curtailing of crypto. \u201CThe day I bought my ticket to go to Albania, most of the Dogecoin withdrawal requests could no longer be met,\u201D he said. In his retelling, Özer arrived at the conclusion that the company itself was worth more than the funds in its wallet, so he saw only one way out: selling it. He started, he said, shopping it around in Istanbul, Italy, and the Balkans. He eventually set up meetings with several potential buyers in Albania. He didn\u2019t give their names. Özer showed the courtroom a news clip with the widely circulated headline that he had fled with $2 billion and defrauded 400,000 people. \u201CAs soon as this news started to appear, both investors were off the table \u2026 I had no other chance to cover the losses of the stolen cryptocurrencies.\u201D He pointed out that the indictment estimated the damages were closer to $43 million and the number of official claimants against him totaled 2,027 people.\nThen his testimony took a Shakespearean turn. \u201CThis was also done with the aim of killing me or having me killed,\u201D he said without flinching. \u201CTo announce to the world that a 27-year-old man with $2 billion in his pocket is alone in a country with high crime rates like Albania.\u201D That, coupled with a red notice from Interpol on his back, and his face on wanted posters around Albania, made him fear for his life. So, he said, he bought a tent and took a taxi to the southern Albanian coastline. He had hoped to ride out the nightmare camping alone. \u201CI needed time for the truth to emerge,\u201D he told the room.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRHe told the court that he grew his beard down to his clavicle, shaved his head. He said that when he learned about the prosecutor\u2019s indictment\u2014that his brother and sister were charged with fraud, that they would stand trial in a month, and that without Özer they would most likely take the blame for Thodex\u2019s fall and spend the rest of their lives in prison\u2014he had a wild idea: If every claimant were paid back, did a crime ever really happen? He did, in fact, have the Thodex cold wallet on him, he told the judges, though he claims to not remember how much was in it. He asked Erarslan to help him pay back the roughly 2,000 plaintiffs who had lost their money.\nAnd they did, in part. In total, while on the run, he paid approximately 185 million lira ($10 million at the time) to more than 1,000 claimants. As Özer tells it, when the cold wallet was empty, he threw it into the Ionian Sea.\nWhen he addressed his use of other people\u2019s accounts to trade crypto\u2014an action at the center of the case\u2014he started to sound defiant and a little condescending: \u201CStartup founders take all responsibilities, as the nature of startups requires,\u201D he said. He underscored that they had no authority in the company and no access to these accounts. \u201CThere is no lawlessness or irregularity. Moreover, I am neither the first nor the last nor the only person to arbitrage the cryptocurrency market.\u201D\nThe draconian sentence is punishment not only for a crime but also for shining a spotlight on decades of embarrassing failures.\nNear the end of his address, Özer\u2019s frustrations seemed to turn to bitterness and hubris. He faced the judges and said it was \u201Cabsurd to think that the IQ level of the person who made such a stupid escape plan\u201D was the same as that of a criminal mastermind allegedly capable of deceiving Turkish financial regulators for four years. \u201CI am smart enough to lead any institution on earth,\u201D Özer said. Then he had Erarslan pull up an image of a cartoon mocking the court. Visibly annoyed, the chief judge ordered him to remove it.\nThe verdict came quietly on a balmy Thursday in September 2023 to an almost empty courtroom. Özer stood and solemnly read the lyrics from a Turkish folk song, \u201CThe End of the Road Is Visible.\u201D\nThe chief judge handed Güven, Serap, and Özer the same sentence: 11,196 years in prison\u2014for establishing and managing a criminal organization and laundering assets. Most of the other defendants were released. It was the longest sentence in Turkey\u2019s history, handed out the month before the Republic\u2019s centennial.\nFARUK FATIH ÖZER became a poster child of crypto crimes, but he also became an accidental representation of a particular economic era\u2014and the lengths people will go through to flee it. To the Turkish regime, he was not so much an opponent as an unfortunate product of flawed economic policies. In that light, the draconian sentence is punishment not only for a crime but also for shining a spotlight on decades of embarrassing failures, ones that were made clear to the entire country the day that Özer disappeared.\nSo perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Turkey remains a haven for cryptocurrencies. In the year after Thodex went bust, inflation in the country hit a 24-year high of 85.5 percent. Prices for goods nearly doubled\u2014and so did the percentage of Turks who owned bitcoin, ether, and other currencies. In terms of trade volume, the country ranks fourth globally, behind the US, the UK, and India. After decades of watching their currency devalue, their businesses and nest eggs get scrambled, the Turkish people aren\u2019t going to pass up the dream so easily. Earlier this year, the country\u2019s finance minister said the government was working to finalize new regulations on crypto, \u201Cto make this field safer and to eliminate possible risks.\u201D So although Özer picked a fight with an authoritarian regime and lost\u2014whether because he believed too fully in the gospel of decentralization, because he was a naive kid, because he was a cynical hustler, or some combination of all three\u2014the flames of economic revolution that he helped fan aren\u2019t going out anytime soon.\nAdditional reporting by Beril Eski, Gülşah Karadağ, and Vladimir Karaj.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

The Lone Star State offered cheap power, plentiful supplies of renewable energy, and an accommodating regulatory climate. Some mining companies already operated there, but when China banned crypto mining in May 2021, a mass migration began. Texas was fast becoming \u201Ca Mecca for bitcoin miners,\u201D said Greg Abbott, the state governor. But lately, the mood has shifted.\nTexas residents have complained that industrial-scale bitcoin mines are driving up energy prices and destroying the quality of life of those living nearby. Meanwhile, politicians are demanding clarity over crypto mining\u2019s impact on both the environment and the stability of the ailing Texas energy grid. The industry has been forced onto the defensive.\nOn February 22, the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC), a pro-mining lobbying group, filed a lawsuit against three parts of the federal government: the US Department of Energy, US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the White House Office of Management and Budget. It objects to an \u201Cemergency\u201D data request initiated in January that required mining firms in Texas to disclose details about their energy usage. Riot Platforms, which operates North America\u2019s largest bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, is a coplaintiff.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nThe complaint alleges that the federal government concocted illegitimate reasons for expediting the survey, forgoing a process that would have allowed mining companies to object. The disclosure of \u201Chighly proprietary\u201D information, the suit claims, would \u201Cimmediately and irreparably harm\u201D the affected businesses. The survey, says TBC president Lee Bratcher, unfairly singled out an \u201Cout of favor\u201D industry.\nOn February 23, the judge in the case issued an order preventing the government from collecting further data. Less than a week later, the case was stayed indefinitely: The government had withdrawn its survey and agreed to destroy all data it had gathered.\nThe lawsuit is just the latest flareup of a broader fight over bitcoin mining in Texas. Detractors and government agencies trying to understand the industry\u2019s full impact have so far been forced to scrape together only \u201Cpiecemeal information,\u201D says Adrian Shelley, an energy policy expert and branch director of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRiot Platforms did not respond to requests for comment.\nStorm Damage\nIn February 2021, Governor Abbott found himself in a political bind. A powerful winter storm had knocked out some of the state\u2019s aging fossil fuel power plants, triggering a blackout that pitched 4.5 million homes into darkness. By the time the storm had abated and power was restored, 246 people had died. Abbott needed a way to shore up the grid. He saw an opportunity in the crypto mining industry.\nCryptocurrency mining is a process whereby computers race to solve a mathematical puzzle and the victor is rewarded with a batch of freshly minted crypto tokens. Today, the competition among miners is such that large fleets of specialized, energy-guzzling hardware are necessary to stand a chance of winning.It may seem harebrained to invite industrial-scale consumers of power onto an already-creaking grid, but bitcoin miners, Abbott hoped, could act as a failsafe of sorts. When demand was low they would pull from renewable energy sources\u2014thus improving the profitability of wind and solar plants and incentivizing new development\u2014and in periods of high demand they would switch off in exchange for a fee. This kind of arrangement is known as demand response. Separately, mining companies could further temper shortfalls in supply by selling back to the grid energy that they had pre-purchased in bulk.\nIn June 2021, Abbott signed a new law that established a formal legal definition for virtual currency and set clear rules for businesses handling it, which he described as part of a \u201Cmaster plan\u201D to attract crypto firms to the state. The following November, in an interview with the TBC, Abbott declared his intention to turn Texas into the \u201Ccenterpiece\u201D of the bitcoin industry.\nIn the period since, some of the world\u2019s largest mining firms\u2014among them Riot, Marathon Digital, Galaxy Digital, and Core Scientific\u2014have either expanded existing facilities or opened new ones in Texas. The latest estimates from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator, from November 2022 suggest crypto miners are using around 2 gigawatts (GW) of energy in Texas, which equates to roughly 2.5 percent of the state\u2019s peak load. But a long queue of companies, representing around an additional 32 GW of consumption, are either awaiting approval for new mining installations or beginning construction. ERCOT declined to provide up-to-date figures.\nThe prospect of more miners tapping the Texas grid has sparked concern among stakeholders who believe, variously, that the influx of mining activity will lead to blackouts, increase the price of energy for consumers, drive up carbon emissions, and damage Texans\u2019 quality of life.\nRecently, state residents that live near large-scale mining facilities have begun to complain about adverse second-order effects, particularly noise pollution generated by the elaborate cooling systems required to keep mining hardware from overheating. \u201CThere is a tremendous amount of vibration that goes through the air. It goes through the walls of people\u2019s homes,\u201D says Lyndon Laird, a candidate for state representative for Texas\u2019 58th district, home to a mine operated by Marathon. \u201CThey cannot sleep at night. Some are having adverse health effects.\u201D\nLaird claims the noise generated by the mining facility has \u201Cseverely disrupted\u201D livestock and other fauna, too. \u201CMany chickens have stopped laying eggs,\u201D he claims. \u201CMuch of the natural wildlife that used to be in the area has vanished.\u201D\nOn March 1, in a letter seen by WIRED, Laird put these complaints to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas, and other state regulators. An accompanying petition was signed by 88 local residents. Marathon declined a request for an interview, but in an open letter published in a local paper said it had \u201Cinitiated an independent sound study\u201D in response to complaints.Others argue the state\u2019s strategy of paying bitcoin miners not to mine when the grid is under heavy load is nonsensical. \u201CThe most important thing a regulator can do is match assets and liabilities\u2014match supply and demand,\u201D says Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston. With the deterioration of the state\u2019s fleet of fossil fuel plants, he says, allowing large-scale mining facilities to increase demand on the grid can only \u201Cexacerbate the situation\u201D and invite further instability.\nIn Texas, claims Hirs, crypto mining is primarily an energy arbitrage business, the profitability of which is dependent on the ability to purchase energy cheaply in bulk and sell it back to the grid at a premium when demand is high. These operations are effectively double-subsidized by residents, says Hirs, whose taxes provide both the funds for buying energy from the miners in periods of peak demand and the fees paid to miners for participating in demand response. Hirs likens miners to parasites, calling them \u201Cthe tapeworm on the ERCOT grid.\u201D\nBefore the recent surge in the price of bitcoin, which has made mining more profitable, news reports noted that some firms made more money by switching off and collecting fees when the grid was under pressure than they were through mining bitcoin. In August 2023, when a Texas heatwave led to a surge in energy demand, Riot said it earned $31.7 million through its participation in grid stabilization programs and only around $10 million from mining.\nData Haze\nOpponents of inviting more mining facilities into Texas have been stymied by the absence of data showing the extent of the additional burden on the grid. Other than the miners themselves, nobody currently knows quite how much energy is devoted to mining in the state or the wider US. The EIA says it has \u201Cdeveloped general estimates,\u201D but can\u2019t piece together an accurate picture due to the \u201Cdifficulty of identifying cryptocurrency mining activity among millions of US end-use customers.\u201D\nIn March 2023, Texas state senators Lois Kolkhorst, Donna Campbell, and Robert Nichols, all Republicans, proposed bill SB 1751, which would have limited participation of crypto miners in demand response, withdrawn certain tax rebates, and imposed data reporting requirements. The bill passed the Senate unanimously, but died when the relevant congressional committee failed to hear it before the end of the session.\nThe emergency survey filed by the EIA in January, prompted at least in part by the efforts of US senator Elizabeth Warren, was designed to fill in the gaps and \u201Cdevelop more rigorous estimates of electricity use by US cryptocurrency miners,\u201D the EIA said. But in the face of the lawsuit brought by the TBC and Riot, it proved to be short-lived.\nCritics of the mining industry have interpreted the move to squash the EIA survey as a cynical attempt to preserve a shroud of secrecy. \u201CThe last thing a parasite wants you to know is how bad it is going to become,\u201D says Hirs. But the mining industry says it had every reason to object, as evinced by the sympathy of the judge, who stated in a ruling that the government\u2019s justifications for expediting the survey\u2014that a rise in crypto prices would incentivize more mining activity and, if the weather were to turn, destabilize power grids\u2014\u201Cfall far short\u201D of the necessary level of risk.In principle, mining companies are not opposed to providing the government with information about energy consumption, claims Bratcher. Their objection related to the scope of the survey\u2014which included data on the precise location of facilities, types of hardware contained therein, and the firms supplying the energy\u2014and to sensitive information being released publicly.\nThe fear is that politicians with an anti-crypto stance might use that data to \u201Cbully commercial partners into not doing business with crypto miners,\u201D says Bratcher. \u201CIt\u2019s not hard to imagine a situation in which a large energy company gets a threatening letter from Senator Warren.\u201D\nAs for concerns about the destabilizing impact of crypto mining, Bratcher claims that \u201Cthe grid is in a far better place now\u201D than in 2021, when it was devastated by the winter storm. \u201CThe miners are filling in the troughs of demand and staving off the peaks,\u201D he says.\nUntil the miners volunteer data on their present and projected energy consumption and terms of their power contracts, those who disagree with Bratcher\u2019s analysis must build their case on top of projections and anecdotal evidence.\nThe TBC expects the federal government to put forward another survey at some point in the future. Bratcher says miners would not object to providing regionalized data on \u201Caggregate energy usage.\u201D In response to a request for data from WIRED, ERCOT said it \u201Cdoes not comment on specific facilities\u2019 power usage.\u201D In a statement, the EIA said it hoped in the future to \u201Cprovide the American public with a clear understanding of energy use from cryptocurrency mining.\u201D\nIn a pro-business state like Texas, says Shelley, even full access to data is unlikely to help activists campaigning for a blanket ban on mining. \u201CIt\u2019s a high bar to convince Texas regulators to start restricting an industry,\u201D he says. However, it could help them to achieve more \u201Cmodest\u201D objectives, says Shelley, like limiting miners\u2019 participation in demand response.\nShelley hopes the bill that promised to cap profits for miners taking part in grid stabilization programs and impose stricter reporting requirements will be revived next year in the state\u2019s next legislative session. \u201CThe public interest in understanding this industry is just too great,\u201D he says.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"For Bitcoin Mines in Texas, the Honeymoon Is Over","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/bitcoin-mining-texas-energy-grid\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","ENERGY","TEXAS","BITCOIN","REGULATION"]},{"date":"03.04.2024","summary":"The transaction, visible on Bitcoin's blockchain, suggests the victim of one of the worst ransomware attacks in years may have paid a very large ransom.","post_content":"The ransomware attack targeting medical firm Change Healthcare has been one of the most disruptive in years, crippling pharmacies across the US\u2014including those in hospitals\u2014and leading to serious snags in the delivery of prescription drugs nationwide for 10 days and counting. Now, a dispute within the criminal underground has revealed a new development in that unfolding debacle: One of the partners of the hackers behind the attack points out that those hackers, a group known as AlphV or BlackCat, received a $22 million transaction that looks very much like a large ransom payment.\nOn March 1, a Bitcoin address connected to AlphV received 350 bitcoins in a single transaction, or close to $22 million based on exchange rates at the time. Then, two days later, someone describing themselves as an affiliate of AlphV\u2014one of the hackers who work with the group to penetrate victim networks\u2014posted to the cybercriminal underground forum RAMP that AlphV had cheated them out of their share of the Change Healthcare ransom, pointing to the publicly visible $22 million transaction on Bitcoin's blockchain as proof.\nThey Cracked the Code to a Locked USB Drive Worth $235 Million in Bitcoin. Then It Got Weird\nStefan Thomas lost the password to an encrypted USB drive holding 7,002 bitcoins. One team of hackers believes they can unlock it\u2014if they can get Thomas to let them.\nBY ANDY GREENBERG\nThat suggests, according to Dmitry Smilyanets, the researcher for security firm Recorded Future who first spotted the post, that Change Healthcare has likely paid AlphV's ransom. \u201CYou can see the number of coins that landed there. You don\u2019t see that kind of transaction so often,\u201D Smilyanets says. \u201CThere\u2019s proof of a large amount landing in the AlphV-controlled Bitcoin wallet. And this affiliate connects this address to the attack on Change Healthcare. So it\u2019s likely that the victim paid the ransom.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\n A spokesperson for Change Healthcare, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group, declined to answer whether it had paid a ransom to AlphV, telling WIRED only that \u201Cwe are focused on the investigation right now.\u201D\nBoth Recorded Future and TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm, connect the Bitcoin address that received the $22 million payment to the AlphV hackers. TRM Labs says it can link the address to payments from two other AlphV victims in January.\nIf Change Healthcare did pay a $22 million ransom, it would not only represent a huge payday for AlphV, but also a dangerous precedent for the health care industry, argues Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused researcher with security firm Emsisoft. Every ransomware payment, he says, both funds future attacks by the group responsible and suggests to other ransomware predators that they should try the same playbook\u2014in this case, attacking health care services that patients depend on.\n\u201CIf Change did pay, it's problematic,\u201D says Callow. \u201CIt highlights the profitability of attacks on the health care sector. Ransomware gangs are nothing if not predictable: If they find a particular sector to be lucrative, they\u2019ll attack it over and over again, rinse and repeat.\u201D\nThe self-described AlphV affiliate who first posted evidence of the payment on RAMP, and who goes by the name \u201Cnotchy,\u201D complained that AlphV had apparently collected the $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare and then kept the entire sum, rather than share the profits with their hacking partner as they had allegedly agreed. \u201CBe careful everyone and stop deal with ALPHV,\" notchy wrote.That affiliate hacker also wrote that in their penetration of Change Healthcare's network, they had accessed the data of numerous other health care firms partnered with the company. If that claim is accurate, Recorded Future's Smilyanets points out, it creates the additional risk that the affiliate hacker still possesses sensitive medical information. Even if Change Healthcare did pay AlphV, the hacker affiliate could still demand additional payment or leak the data independently.\n\u201CThe affiliates still have this data, and they\u2019re mad they didn\u2019t receive this money,\u201D says Smilyanets. \u201CIt\u2019s a good lesson for everyone. You cannot trust criminals; their word is worth nothing.\u201D\nAs ransomware payments go, $22 million would represent a remarkably profitable score for AlphV. Only a relatively small number of ransoms in the history of ransomware, such as the $40 million payment made by the financial firm CNA to the hackers known as Evil Corp, have been so large, says Emsisoft's Callow. \u201CIt\u2019s not without precedent, but it\u2019s certainly very unusual,\u201D he says.\nRegardless of whether Change Healthcare is confirmed to have paid that ransom, the attack shows that AlphV has pulled off a disturbing comeback: In December, it was the target of an FBI operation that seized its dark web sites and released decryption keys that foiled its attacks on hundreds of victims. Just two months later, it carried out the cyberattack that paralyzed Change Healthcare, triggering an outage whose effects on pharmacies and their patients have now stretched well beyond a week. As of last Tuesday, AlphV listed 28 companies on the dark web site it uses to extort its victims, not including Change Healthcare.\nThat site has now gone offline. As of Tuesday morning, it displayed what appeared to be a law enforcement seizure notice, but security researcher Fabian Wosar points out that the notice seems to have been copied from AlphV's last takedown. The reason for the group's disappearance\u2014whether due to another law enforcement operation or AlphV's attempts to dodge its own cheated affiliates\u2014is unclear. Ransomware trackers say AlphV has disappeared and rebranded several times before. Earlier incarnations under the name BlackCat, BlackMatter, and Darkside were all more or less the same group, security researchers note.\nIn fact, the hackers working under that Darkside handle were responsible for the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that triggered the shutdown of gas transportation across the Eastern Seaboard of the US and resulted in a brief fuel shortage in some East Coast cities. In that case, too, the victims paid the hackers' ransom. \u201CIt was the hardest decision I've made,\u201D Colonial's CEO Joseph Blount later told a US congressional hearing.\nNow, it seems, some of the same hackers may have forced yet another company to make that same hard decision.\nUpdate 3\/4\/2024, 1:50 pm EST: Included additional contextual details about AlphV and related ransomware attacks.\nUpdated 3\/5\/2024, 10:30 am EST to note that AlphV's dark web site now displays what appears to be a law enforcement takedown message.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Hackers Behind the Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack Just Received a $22 Million Payment","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/alphv-change-healthcare-ransomware-payment\/","tags":["","RANSOMWARE","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME","HEALTHCARE"]},{"date":"02.21.2024","summary":"Anne Neuberger, the Biden administration\u2019s deputy national security adviser for cyber, tells WIRED about emerging cybersecurity threats\u2014and what the US plans to do about them.","post_content":"When Anne Neuberger stepped into the newly created role of deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology on the White House\u2019s National Security Council at the start of the Biden administration, she was already one of the government\u2019s most experienced cyber veterans.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY GARRETT M.

The book is a self-interested caution against overcaution\u2014please don\u2019t throw out the blockchain baby with the grimy crypto bathwater.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow Meme Detectives Stop NFT Fraud\nDixon outlines a cultural divide within the crypto industry. One faction, which he terms the \u201Ccrypto casino,\u201D is interested only in financial speculation and includes many schemers and fraudsters. The other faction believes that blockchain is not just a form of accounting ledger, but a new computing platform that opens up horizons far grander than just new forms of financial trading.\nSo far, the first faction is winning. The attention-grabbing behavior of the global crypto casino, Dixon says, threatens to suffocate both the technology\u2019s development and enthusiasm for its potential. \u201CThe casino is the flashier story. It\u2019s fortunes won and lost. It\u2019s scandal,\u201D he says in an interview with WIRED. \u201CThe productive side is slower-moving. It is crowded out with all the noise.\u201D\nNew technologies typically develop in fits and starts over a span of multiple decades, says Dixon, who has worked in internet software for 25 years and sold startups of his own to McAfee and eBay. Then comes a breakthrough\u2014an iPhone or ChatGPT moment\u2014that makes the value of the new thing undeniable. Dixon judges blockchain to still be waiting for its breakout moment. Crypto entrepreneurs can\u2019t afford to ignore their industry\u2019s poor reputation, he says, because it steers the thinking of policymakers towards tighter regulation. As things stand, he says, tough policies are coming \u201Cvery, very quickly.\u201D Dixon argues that should worry not just crypto dreamers, but wider society too.\nTrust Busting\nBlockchains come in various forms but can generally be thought of as public records of information, hosted and maintained by large groups of people instead of by a single authority. Entries are added and verified through regular cross-checks to make the whole project trustworthy, a process incentivized with crypto token rewards. Blockchains can also support software applications that operate under predefined rules that use its entries as a kind of backbone, with crowdsourced governance provided by a voting system.\nDixon argues that society needs that technology to take off even more than does his employer, which needs to find returns on billions invested in four separate funds dedicated to crypto. The internet is being strangled by profit-hungry monopolists, and users are suffering for it, Dixon claims, but blockchain could wrest some control away from the world\u2019s largest tech companies and return the internet to its egalitarian roots.The book traces the following thesis: At first, the internet was open, but limited. Private companies brought interactivity to the web and grew fat on the proceeds, but that made it difficult for users to leave their networks and for competitors to enter the market. The concentration of power in the hands of Big Tech led to a process of enshittification, whereby companies deprioritize the interests of users and clip the revenue shared with content creators in favor of juicing profits.\nBuilding internet platforms on top of blockchain, which enforces pre-coded rules changeable only by popular vote, Dixon writes, could \u201Creverse the trend toward internet consolidation and restore communities to their rightful place as stewards of the future.\u201D That might sound abstract, he concedes, but because the internet is \u201Cincreasingly where we live our lives,\u201D it matters who gets to set the rules. If everyone had a say, less personal data might be harvested, fewer creators might be shadow-banned, content feeds might be crammed with fewer ads, product searches might yield the best-matching results instead of the most profitable ones, and so forth.\nVenture capitalist Chris Dixon argues that blockchain technology could kick-start a creative new era of the internet.\nPHOTOGRAPH: MICHAEL HALSBAND\nFor a VC firm like a16z, of course, the possibility that blockchain might loosen the stranglehold of incumbent technology firms also represents a fresh bite at the internet cherry. With a route cleared for new competitors, there is a greater prospect of turning the next internet startup into something big. \u201CKeeping the internet open,\u201D as Dixon describes it, amounts to \u201Csmart capitalism\u201D that benefits everyone by incentivizing experimentation that creates useful new technology.\nIn practice, though, attempts to deliver a blockchain version of the internet have run into their own challenges. Take decentralized autonomous organizations\u2014the token-based voting structures that Dixon proposes will let users \u201Cshare in control\u201D over internet platforms by giving them veto rights on any changes. Since the idea was first tested in 2016, DAOs have proven inefficient and overly bureaucratic and function as democracies only in theory. In practice, participants struggle to agree on which changes to propose, don\u2019t turn out to vote, or blindly follow someone else\u2019s lead, defeating the purpose of the decentralized model. Democracy can flip into plutocracy if a single party accrues enough voting credits, which gets easier when voter turnout is low. a16z itself holds large amounts of voting tokens in a number of blockchain projects.\nThe poor usability of blockchain-based software also weakens another pillar of Dixon\u2019s case. He writes that the technology could allow revenue to be shared more equitably between social platforms and the content creators that populate them, by giving creators the power to observe and reject unfavorable changes to the terms of the relationship. However, as figures like Moxie Marlinspike, creator of secure messaging app Signal, have argued, the clunkiness of blockchain might simply drive people toward new intermediaries that can make things simpler, replacing old rent-seeking gatekeepers with new ones.\nDixon acknowledges these shortcomings and more in his book. But he insists that the emergence of even an unpolished alternative for governing internet platforms is a step forward. Blockchain is \u201Cmessy and imperfect,\u201D he says, but the alternative is worse. \u201CWe are going to have an internet that is siloed off. That is a depressing, dystopian outcome, and we are heading to it quickly,\u201D he says. \u201CI think people should care.\u201D\nInternet Reboot\nIn choosing to couch his case for blockchain in the perils of the status quo, rather than exclusively in the technology\u2019s merits, Dixon takes a different approach than a16z founder Marc Andreessen. In an essay published in October, \u201CThe Techno-Optimist Manifesto,\u201D Andreessen asserted that \u201Ctechnology is the glory of human ambition,\u201D and that those who stand in the way of its development are complicit in a \u201Cmass demoralization campaign\u201D premised on outmoded socialist ideas. The manifesto was applauded by some technologists as a \u201Cbreath of fresh air,\u201D but critiqued elsewhere\u2014including by The New York Times, Financial Times, and WIRED\u2014as overwrought, blinkered and even dangerous.\nDixon claims that he and Andreessen are largely aligned, believing that \u201Ca lot of our problems can be solved by building, as opposed to being afraid of technology.\u201D In the book, he reserves a few barbs for the \u201Cestablishment\u201D and its \u201Cmyopic\u201D dismissal of blockchain, and also jabs at the press, which by \u201Ccherry-picking the worst examples of an emerging technology\u201D engages in a \u201Cdisingenuous form of criticism.\u201D Yet where Andreessen is unyielding, Dixon leaves room for doubt: The internet has been \u201Chijacked,\u201D he says, and blockchain just might represent the best way to \u201Cbuild our way out of it.\u201DThe opportunity for blockchain to play the role that Dixon proposes\u2014to help rebalance the economic relationship between internet users, creators and service providers\u2014is under threat, he claims. The crypto industry\u2019s casino culture is to blame. \u201CThe excesses of casino culture have provoked a backlash, including reactions from regulators and policymakers that can be counterproductive,\u201D writes Dixon.\nA number of countries are forging ahead with comprehensive, crypto-specific regulatory regimes, like the EU, whose landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation is due to take effect in December. The US is lagging somewhat behind, with only narrow bills having been proposed in Congress to date. In the absence of new policy, two US financial regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, are sparring for jurisdiction over crypto. The result is broad uncertainty about the legal classification of blockchain-based tokens in the US and the rules that crypto companies must follow.\nDixon says he agrees with regulators on some things but fears their clumsy execution. \u201CThe right approach would be to tamp down the casino. The current approach is doing the opposite,\u201D he says, with legitimate entrepreneurs afraid to build new products but scammers going mostly unchecked. Recent high-profile crypto disasters, like the fall of crypto exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Dixon fears, will lead US policymakers to assume that future legislation should be even tougher.\nDixon doesn\u2019t expect everyone who picks up Read Write Own, he says, to fall head over heels for the utopian blockchain vision. But he hopes they recognize that regulatory overreaction could choke off ideas that could rejuvenate the internet and everything built on it\u2014that is, more or less everything. \u201CThis is a critical moment. I don\u2019t think we can wait much longer to think about designs that could return us to the original promise of the internet,\u201D Dixon says. \u201CSomething has to be done, right?\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"A Last-Ditch Plan to Save the Crypto Industry","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/a-last-ditch-plan-to-save-the-crypto-industry\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","INVESTING","VENTURE CAPITAL","FTX TRIAL","INTERNET CULTURE","ANTITRUST"]},{"date":"01.24.2024","summary":"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, offer independently-minded internet users a safe haven\u2014but it\u2019s also a boon to those with a darker purpose.","post_content":"Can you imagine what a digital white ethnostate or a cyber caliphate might look like?

The use of anonymous bitcoin wallets and non-transparent cryptocurrencies such as Monero is already widespread among extremists whose bank accounts have been frozen. A shift to entirely decentralized forms of self-governance is only one step away.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow Mind-Controlled Bionic Arms Fuse To The Body\nBeyond practical reasons that encourage extremists to create their own self-governed structures, there is an ideological incentive too: their fundamental distrust in the establishment. If you believe that the deep state or the \u201Cglobal Jewish elites\u201D control everything from governments and Big Tech to the global banking system, DAOs offer an appealing alternative. Conversations on far-right fringe platforms such as BitChute and Odysee reveal that there is much appetite for decentralized alternative forms of collaboration, communication, and crowdfunding.\nSo what happens if anti-minority groups establish their own digital worlds in which they impose their own governing mechanisms? What are the stakes if trolling armies start cooperating via DAOs to launch election interference campaigns? The activities of extremist DAOs could challenge the rule of law, pose a threat to minority groups, and disrupt institutions that are currently considered fundamental pillars of democratic systems. Another risk is that DAOs can serve as safe havens for extremist movements by enabling users to circumvent government regulation and security services monitoring activities. They might also allow extremists to find new ways to fundraise, plan, and plot radicalization campaigns or even attacks. While many governments have focused on developing legal frameworks to regulate AI, few have even recognized the existence of DAOs. Their looming exploitation for extremist and criminal purposes is something that has flown under the radar of global policymakers.\nTechnology expert Carl Miller, who has long warned of potential misuse of DAOs, told me that \u201Ceven though DAOs behave like companies, they are not registered as legal entities.\u201D There are only a few exceptions: The US states of Wyoming, Vermont, and Tennessee have passed laws to legally recognize DAOs. With no regulations in place to hold DAOs accountable for extremist or criminal activities, the big question for 2024 will be: How can we ensure the metaverse doesn\u2019t give rise to digital white ethnostates or cyber caliphates?","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65b0300972d610707cc3c3dd\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/WW2024_1230465097_SECURITY_Julia-Ebner.jpg","author":"BY JULIA EBNER","title":"A Dangerous New Home for Online Extremism","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/a-dangerous-new-home-for-online-extremism\/","tags":["","THE WIRED WORLD IN 2024","POLITICS","WEB3"]},{"date":"01.18.2024","summary":"A new report from Chainalysis finds that stablecoins like Tether, tied to the value of the US dollar, were used in the vast majority of crypto-based scam transactions and sanctions evasion in 2023.","post_content":"Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable value like the US dollar, were created with the promise of bringing the frictionless, border-crossing fluidity of Bitcoin to a form of digital money with far less volatility.

That discovery would upend the world of cybercrime. Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world\u2019s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web\u2019s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nThat 180-degree flip in the world\u2019s understanding of cryptocurrency\u2019s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn\u2019s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer\u2019s mining power to 11 different mining \u201Cpools,\u201D groups that collected users\u2019 computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\nPHOTOGRAPH: PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nWalmart\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\nMeiklejohn\u2019s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists\u2019 idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous.\nA collage from Meiklejohn\u2019s research paper showing every object she bought with Bitcoin in her tracing experiments.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNAS MEIKLEJOHN PAINSTAKINGLY fiddled with bitcoins and watched the digital trails they created, she found herself having flashbacks to a particular day, decades earlier, in her mother\u2019s downtown Manhattan office. That morning, Meiklejohn and her mother had taken the subway together, all the way from their Upper West Side apartment near the American Museum of Natural History to the federal building at Foley Square, across from the city\u2019s intimidating, stone-columned courthouses.\nMeiklejohn was still in elementary school, but it was take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Meiklejohn\u2019s mother was a federal prosecutor. Over the years that followed, the elder Meiklejohn would make her career taking on contractors who were bilking the city government out of tax dollars\u2014bribing government staffers to choose overpriced school food or street-paving services\u2014or else banks colluding to sell low-performing investments to the city\u2019s financiers. Many of her targets in those corruption probes would be sentenced to years in prison.\nThat day in the Justice Department\u2019s New York office, Sarah Meiklejohn, not yet 10 years old, was put to work. She was assigned to comb through a pile of paper checks, searching for clues of a corrupt kickback scheme in one of her mother\u2019s investigations.\nIt was that feeling, the drive to manually assemble tiny data points that built into a larger picture, that would give Meiklejohn a kind of déjà vu 20 years later as she studied the Bitcoin blockchain, even before she consciously knew what she was doing.\n\u201CSomewhere in the back of my mind was this idea,\u201D says Meiklejohn, \u201Cthe idea of following the money.\u201D\nAs a child, Meiklejohn loved puzzles\u2014the more complex, the better. On road trips, in airports, or any other time the small-for-her-age, hyper-inquisitive girl needed to be distracted, her mother would hand her a book of puzzles. One of the first websites Meiklejohn remembers visiting on the nascent World Wide Web was a GeoCities page devoted to deciphering the Kryptos sculpture on the campus of the CIA, whose copper, ribbonlike surface contained four coded messages that even the cryptanalysts at Langley hadn\u2019t been able to crack. By the age of 14 she would finish the New York Times crossword puzzle every day of the week.\nOn a vacation to London, Meiklejohn\u2019s family visited the British Museum, and Meiklejohn became fixated on the Rosetta stone, along with the broader notion of ancient languages\u2014the remnants of entire cultures\u2014that could be deciphered if the puzzler simply found the right key. Soon she was reading about Linear A and Linear B, a pair of written scripts used by the Minoan civilization on Crete until roughly 1500 BC. Linear B had been deciphered only in the 1950s, thanks in large part to a classicist at Brooklyn College named Alice Kober who labored in obscurity over samples of the Bronze Age language for 20 years, writing her notes on 180,000 index cards.\nMeiklejohn became so obsessed with Linear A and B that she persuaded a teacher at her middle school to organize an evening seminar on the subject (only she and one friend attended). More tantalizing than even the story of Alice Kober\u2019s work on Linear B, for Meiklejohn, was the fact that no one had been able to decipher Linear A, even after a century of study. The best puzzles of all were the ones that had no answer key\u2014the ones for which no one even knew if a solution existed.When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201Cunbreakable\u201D system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\nMEIKLEJOHN SHOWED REAL talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.Considering Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics for the first time, Meiklejohn was intrigued. But when she got home from the hike and began poring over Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper, it immediately became clear to her that Bitcoin\u2019s trade-offs were the exact opposite of the eCash system she knew so well. Fraud was prevented not by a kind of after-the-fact forgery analysis carried out by a bank authority but with an instantaneous check of the blockchain, the unforgeable public record of who possessed every single bitcoin.\nBut that blockchain ledger system came at an enormous privacy cost: In Bitcoin, for good and for ill, everyone was a witness to every payment. Yes, identities behind those payments were obscured by pseudonymous addresses, long strings of between 26 and 35 characters. But to Meiklejohn, this seemed like an inherently dangerous sort of fig leaf to hide behind. Unlike eCash, whose privacy protections offered snoops no hint of revealing information to latch onto, Bitcoin offered an enormous collection of data to analyze. Who could say what sorts of patterns might give away users who thought they were cleverer than those watching them?\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CAnd so as a cryptographer, the natural question was, if you can\u2019t prove it\u2019s private, then what attacks are possible? If you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nThe temptation was more than Meiklejohn could resist. The blockchain, like a massive, undeciphered corpus of an ancient language, hid a wealth of secrets in plain view.\nWHEN MEIKLEJOHN BEGAN digging into the blockchain in late 2012, she started with a very simple question: How many people were using bitcoin?\nThat number was much harder to pin down than it might seem. After downloading the entire blockchain onto a UCSD server and organizing it into a database that she could query, like a gargantuan, searchable spreadsheet, she could see that there were more than 12 million distinct Bitcoin addresses, among which there had been nearly 16 million transactions. But even amid all that activity, there were plenty of recognizable events in Bitcoin\u2019s history visible to the naked eye. Spenders and recipients might have been hidden behind pseudonymous addresses, but some transactions were unmistakable, like distinctive pieces of furniture hidden under thin sheets in someone\u2019s attic.\nShe could see, for instance, the nearly 1 million bitcoins that were mined by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency, before others started using it, as well as the first transaction ever made when Satoshi sent 10 coins as a test to the early Bitcoin developer Hal Finney in January 2009. She spotted, too, the first payment with real value, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz famously sold a friend two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010 (as of this writing worth hundreds of millions of dollars).\nPlenty of other addresses and transactions had been recognized and widely discussed on forums like Bitcointalk, and Meiklejohn spent hours cutting and pasting long strings of characters into Google to see if someone had already claimed credit for an address or if other Bitcoin users had been gossiping about certain high-value transactions. By the time Meiklejohn began to look, anyone with enough interest and patience to wade through a sea of garbled addresses could see money transfers between mysterious parties just beneath the surface of the blockchain\u2019s obfuscation that, even at the time, were often worth small fortunes.Getting beyond that obfuscation, however, was the real challenge. Sure, Meiklejohn could see transactions between addresses. But the problem was drilling down further, definitively drawing a boundary around the bitcoin hoard of any single person or organization. A user could have as many addresses as they chose to create with one of the many wallet programs that managed their coins\u2014like a bank that allows you to spread your wealth across as many accounts as you liked, creating new ones with a mouse click. Plenty of those programs even automatically generated new addresses every time the user received a bitcoin payment, adding to the confusion.\nStill, Meiklejohn was sure that searching for patterns in the mess of transactions would allow her to untangle at least some of them. In Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s own original white paper, Meiklejohn recalled that he had briefly alluded to a technique that could be used to collapse some addresses into single identities. Often, a single bitcoin transaction has multiple \u201Cinputs\u201D from different addresses. If someone wants to pay a friend 10 bitcoins but holds those coins at two different addresses of five coins each, the spender\u2019s wallet software creates a single transaction that lists the two five-coin addresses as inputs and the address receiving 10 coins as the output. To make the payment possible, the payer would need to possess both of the so-called secret keys that allow the five coins at each address to be spent. That means anyone looking at the transaction on the blockchain can reasonably identify both of the input addresses as belonging to the same person or organization.\nSatoshi had hinted at the privacy dangers this introduced. \u201CSome linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,\u201D Satoshi wrote. \u201CThe risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.\u201D\nSo, as Meiklejohn\u2019s first step, she simply tried the technique Satoshi had inadvertently suggested\u2014across every bitcoin payment ever carried out. She scanned her blockchain database for every multi-input transaction, linking all of those double, triple, or even hundredfold inputs to single identities. The result immediately reduced the number of potential Bitcoin users from 12 million to date to around 5 million, slicing away more than half of the problem.\nMeiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked.\nOnly after that initial step\u2014practically a freebie\u2014did Meiklejohn switch her brain into true puzzle-solving mode. Like a 20th-century archaeologist scanning hieroglyphics for identifiable words or phrases that might help to decipher a passage of text, she began to hunt through Bitcoin\u2019s transactions for other clues that might reveal identifying information. Messing around with bitcoin wallets\u2014making test payments to herself and her colleagues\u2014she began to understand a quirk of the cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin wallets only allowed spenders to pay the entire amount of coins sitting at a certain address. Each address was like a piggy bank that has to be smashed open to spend the coins inside. Spend less than the whole amount in that piggy bank and the leftovers have to be stored in a newly created piggy bank.\nThis second piggy bank, in Bitcoin\u2019s system, is called a \u201Cchange\u201D address: When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient\u2019s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn\u2019t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address\u2014a piggy bank that had materialized on the spot to receive leftover coins from the one that had just been shattered. And that meant these two piggy banks\u2014the spender\u2019s address and the change address\u2014must belong to the same person.\nMeiklejohn began to apply that change-making lens, looking for instances where she could link spenders and the remainders of their payments. She began to see how powerful the simple act of tracking bitcoin change could be: In instances where she couldn\u2019t distinguish a recipient address from a change address, she would be stuck at a fork in the road with no signposts. But if she could link change addresses to the addresses they had split off from, she could make her own signposts. She could follow the money despite its branching paths.\nThe result was that Meiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked: A single sum of coins would move from change address to change address as the spender paid fractions of the total pile of coins in one small payment after another. The remainder of the pile might move to a fresh address with each payment, but those addresses must all represent the transactions of a single spender.\nShe\u2019d come to refer to those chains of transactions as \u201Cpeeling chains\u201D (or sometimes just \u201Cpeel chains\u201D). She thought of them like someone peeling bills off a roll of dollar bills: Though the roll of bills might be put back in a different pocket after a bill was peeled off and spent, it was still fundamentally one wad of cash with a consistent owner. Following these peeling chains opened avenues to trace the digital money\u2019s movements like never before.\nMeiklejohn now had two clever techniques, both of which were capable of linking multiple Bitcoin addresses to a single person or organization, what she came to call \u201Cclustering.\u201D What had initially looked like disparate addresses could now be connected into clusters that encompassed hundreds or, in some cases, even thousands of addresses.\nAlready, she was tracing bitcoins in ways that many of the cryptocurrency\u2019s users wouldn\u2019t have believed possible. But following coins didn\u2019t necessarily mean understanding who owned them. The identities behind those coins remained a mystery, and each of her clusters remained just as pseudonymous as the single, disconnected addresses had been originally. To put a name to those clusters, she began to realize, she\u2019d have to take a much more hands-on approach: not simply observing the artifacts of the Bitcoin economy after the fact like an archaeologist, but becoming a player in it herself\u2014in some cases, an undercover one.\nSEARCHING FOR GUIDANCE in her budding Bitcoin research, Meiklejohn turned to Stefan Savage, a UCSD professor who was on the other end of the spectrum from the deeply mathematical cryptography research Meiklejohn had spent years on. Savage was a hands-on, empirical researcher, more interested in real-world experiments with real-world results than abstractions. He had been one of the lead advisers of a now-legendary team of researchers who had first shown it was possible to hack a car over the internet, demonstrating to General Motors in 2011 that his team could remotely take over a Chevy Impala\u2019s steering and brakes via the cellular radio in its OnStar system, a shocking feat of hacker wizardry.More recently, Savage had helped lead a group that included Kirill Levchenko\u2014the scientist who\u2019d introduced Meiklejohn to Bitcoin on their desert hike\u2014working on a massively ambitious project to track the spam email ecosystem. In that research, as with the earlier car-hacking breakthrough, Savage\u2019s team hadn\u2019t been afraid to get their hands dirty: They\u2019d collected hundreds of millions of web links in junk marketing emails, mostly ones intended to sell real and fake pharmaceuticals. Then, as Savage describes it, they acted out the role of \u201Cthe world\u2019s most gullible person,\u201D using bots to click through on every one of those links to see where they led and spending more than $50,000 on the products the spammers were hawking\u2014all while working with a cooperative credit card issuer to trace the funds and see which banks ended up with the money.\nSeveral of those shady banks were ultimately shut down as a result of the researchers\u2019 tracing work. As another UCSD professor working on the project, Geoffrey Voelker, described it at the time, \u201COur secret weapon is shopping.\u201D\nSo when Meiklejohn began talking over her Bitcoin tracking project with Savage, the two agreed she should take the same approach: She would manually identify Bitcoin addresses one by one by doing transactions with them herself, like a cop on the narcotics beat carrying out buy-and-busts.\nThat\u2019s how Meiklejohn found herself in the early weeks of 2013 ordering coffee, cupcakes, trading cards, mugs, baseball hats, silver coins, socks, and a closet\u2019s worth of other truly random objects from online vendors who accepted bitcoin; joining more than a dozen mining collectives; fiendishly gambling bitcoins at every online crypto casino she could find; and moving bitcoins into and out of accounts on practically every existing bitcoin exchange\u2014and the Silk Road\u2014again and again.\nThe hundreds of addresses Meiklejohn identified and tagged manually with those 344 transactions represented only the tiniest fraction of the overall bitcoin landscape. But when she combined her address tagging with her chaining and clustering techniques, many of those tags suddenly identified not just a single address but an enormous cluster belonging to the same owner. With just a few hundred tags, she had put an identity to more than a million of Bitcoin\u2019s once-pseudonymous addresses.\nA chart from Meiklejohn\u2019s paper showing her \u201Cclustering\u201D of Bitcoin addresses for early cryptocurrency entities.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNWith just the 30 addresses she had identified by moving coins into and out of Mt. Gox, for instance, she could now link more than 500,000 addresses to the exchange. And based on just four deposits and seven withdrawals into wallets on the Silk Road, she was able to identify nearly 300,000 of the black market\u2019s addresses. This breakthrough didn\u2019t mean Meiklejohn could identify any actual users of the Silk Road by name, nor could she unmask, of course, the mysterious kingpin of that site, the ultra libertarian Dread Pirate Roberts. But it would directly contradict DPR\u2019s claims to me that his Bitcoin \u201Ctumbler\u201D system could prevent observers from even seeing when users moved cryptocurrency into and out of their Silk Road accounts.\nWhen Meiklejohn brought her results back to Savage, her adviser was impressed. But as they began to plan to publish a paper on her findings, he wanted a concrete demonstration for readers, not a bunch of arcane statistics. \u201CWe need to show people,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers him saying, \u201Cwhat these techniques can actually do.\u201D\nSo Meiklejohn went a step further: She began to look for specific bitcoin transactions she could track\u2014particularly criminal ones.\nAS MEIKLEJOHN HAD trawled cryptocurrency forums for discussions of interesting addresses worth scrutinizing, one mysterious mountain of money in particular stood out: This single address had, over the course of 2012, accumulated 613,326 bitcoins\u20145 percent of all the coins in circulation. It represented around $7.5 million at the time, a figure nowhere near the billions it would represent today, but a heady sum nonetheless. Rumors among Bitcoin users suggested that the hoard was possibly a Silk Road wallet, or perhaps the result of an unrelated, notorious Bitcoin Ponzi scheme carried out by a user known as pirate@40.\nMeiklejohn couldn\u2019t say which of the two rumors might be correct. But with her clustering techniques, she could now follow that giant sum of cryptocurrency. She saw that after conspicuously gathering at one address, the pile of money had been broken up in late 2012 and sent on forking paths around the blockchain. Meiklejohn\u2019s understanding of peel chains meant she could now trace those sums of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as they split, distinguishing the amount that remained in the control of the initial owner from the smaller sums that were peeled off in subsequent payments. Eventually, several of those peel chains led to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, where they seemed to be cashed out for traditional currency. For an academic researcher, this was a dead end. But anyone with the subpoena power of law enforcement, Meiklejohn realized, could very likely force those exchanges to hand over information about the accounts behind those transactions and solve the mystery of the $7.5 million stash.\nFar from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\nLooking for more coins to hunt, Meiklejohn turned her focus to another sort of dirty money. Large-scale cryptocurrency heists were, in early 2013, a growing epidemic. After all, bitcoin was like cash or gold. Anyone who stole a Bitcoin address\u2019s secret key could empty out that address like a digital safe. Unlike with credit cards or other digital payment systems, there was no overseer who could stop or reverse the money\u2019s movement. That had made every bitcoin business and its stash of crypto revenue a ripe target for hackers, especially if the holders of those funds made the mistake of storing their secret keys on internet-connected computers\u2014the equivalent of carrying six- or seven-figure sums of cash in their pockets while strolling through a dangerous neighborhood.\nMeiklejohn found a thread on Bitcointalk that listed addresses of many of the biggest, most conspicuous crypto thefts in recent memory, and she began to follow the money. Looking at a robbery of 3,171 coins from an early bitcoin gambling site, she immediately found she could trace the stolen funds across no fewer than ten hops, from address to address, before different branches of the money were cashed out at exchanges. Another theft of 18,500 bitcoins from the exchange Bitcoinica similarly led her along a winding series of peel chains that ended at three other exchanges, where the robbers were no doubt cashing in their ill-gotten gains. Sitting in front of Meiklejohn, on her screen, was a bonanza of leads, each just waiting for any actual criminal investigator with a handful of subpoenas to follow them.Now, when Meiklejohn showed Savage her results, he agreed: They were ready to publish.\nIn the final draft of the paper Meiklejohn and her coauthors put together, they definitively stated conclusions\u2014based for the first time on solid, empirical evidence\u2014that flew in the face of what many Bitcoin users believed at the time: Far from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\n\u201CEven our relatively small experiment demonstrates that this approach can shed considerable light on the structure of the Bitcoin economy, how it is used, and those organizations who are party to it,\u201D the paper read. \u201CWe demonstrate that an agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the public nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary flows to major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.\u201D\nHaving set down those words, and blowing a gaping hole in the myth of Bitcoin\u2019s inherent untraceability, Meiklejohn, Savage, and her other adviser Geoffrey Voelker started brainstorming a clever title. In an homage to the Wild West of the economy they were chronicling\u2014and her advisers\u2019 mutual love of spaghetti Westerns\u2014they started with the phrase \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins,\u201D an allusion to the 1960s Clint Eastwood classic A Fistful of Dollars. They settled on a subtitle that evoked both Eastwood\u2019s most famous cowboy vigilante and the world of shadowy figures their nascent techniques could unmask. When the UCSD paper hit the internet in August 2013, it was introduced with a description that, to those involved, had come to seem inevitable: \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.\u201D\nIn the new era of cryptocurrency tracing that would follow Meiklejohn\u2019s work, they wouldn\u2019t remain nameless for long.\nAdapted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency.

The post, which also included an image with an apparently fake quote from Gensler, has since been deleted.\nThe fake post appeared to lead to a brief spike in Bitcoin\u2019s value of around 2.5 percent, to nearly $47,870, before crashing around 3.2 percent from its original price.\nFollowing news of the SEC's compromised account, US senator Bill Hagerty said in a post on X that Congress should investigate the incident.\n\u201CJust like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened,\u201D Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, wrote. \u201CThis is unacceptable.\u201D\nThis is at least the second high-profile compromise of an X account in recent days. Mandiant, a leading cybersecurity firm now owned by Google, had its X account hacked on January 3. A scammer used their access to post a malicious link in an attempt to steal cryptocurrency from victims.\nX owner Elon Musk\u2019s aggressive slashing of the company's staff has, over the past year, raised fears that the cuts would leave X (formerly Twitter) unable to secure a platform depended on by users that include high-profile figures and government agencies worldwide. One former Twitter information security official sued Musk and others for alleged wrongful termination after he was fired for, he claims in the lawsuit, arguing that the staff cuts would interfere with X\u2019s ability to comply with a 2011 consent decree with the US Federal Trade Commission to protect users\u2019 personal information.Even before Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company, former Twitter chief security officer Peiter Zatko filed an extensive whistleblower report to US government agencies about the company\u2019s alleged security issues, including the claim that it gave its own staff too much unmonitored access to the platform.\n\u201CPeople put a lot of trust into an entity that has stopped being a serious company,\u201D says Allison Nixon, the chief research officer for cybersecurity firm Unit 221B, which frequently deals with hackers\u2019 account takeovers. \u201CIf a government wants to be able to make statements that people can rely on, they can\u2019t do that on a platform that has a targeted-account-takeover problem.\u201D\nThe SEC account\u2019s compromise is arguably the most consequential hijacking of a public figure\u2019s Twitter account since 2020, when a group of young hackers tricked Twitter employees into giving them access to a powerful internal tool that allowed them to take control of users\u2019 profiles.\nThey used it to post a scam messages to the accounts of users that included Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Kim Kardashian, offering to donate twice the amount of any payment users sent to the hackers\u2019 Bitcoin addresses back to the sender. The scam netted nearly $120,000 within minutes before the messages could be deleted. In that case, the hackers were identified\u2014in part thanks to cryptocurrency-tracing evidence left on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain\u2014and were arrested within two weeks.\nSoon after news of the @SECGov\u2019s compromise broke, Musk responded to a post joking about the account\u2019s security. \u201CWhat\u2019s the SEC\u2019s password?

The company fired nearly 30 employees in response.\nA New Surveillance Tool Invades Border Towns\nA mass surveillance tool that eavesdrops on wireless signals emitted from smartwatches, earbuds, and cars is currently being deployed at the border to track people\u2019s location in real time, a report from Notus revealed on Monday. According to its manufacturer, the tool, TraffiCatch, associates wireless signals broadcast by commonly used devices with vehicles identified by license plate readers in the area. A captain from the sheriff\u2019s office in Webb County, Texas\u2014whose jurisdiction includes the border city of Laredo\u2014told the publication that the agency uses TraffiCatch to detect devices in areas where they shouldn\u2019t be, for instance, to find trespassers.\nSeveral states require law enforcement agencies to obtain warrants before deploying devices that mimic cell towers to obtain data from the devices tricked into connecting to it. But in the case of TraffiCatch, a technology that passively siphons ambient wireless signals out of the air, the courts haven\u2019t yet weighed in. The report highlights how signals intelligence technology, once exclusive to the military, is now available for purchase by both local governments and the general public.\nAn Indian Assassination Plot in America\nThe Washington Post reports that an officer in India's intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing, was allegedly involved in a botched plan to assassinate one of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi's top critics in the United States. The White House said Monday that it was taking the matter \"very, very seriously,\" while India's foreign ministry blasted the Post report as \"unwarranted\" and \"not helpful.\" The alleged plot to murder the Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, was first disclosed by US authorities in November.\nCanadian authorities previously announced having obtained \"credible\" intel allegedly linking the Indian government to the death of another separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot to death outside a Sikh temple in a Vancouver suburb last summer.\nAn AI Security Bill Emerges\nUS lawmakers have introduced a bill aimed at establishing a new wing of the National Security Agency dedicated to investigating threats aimed at AI systems\u2014or \"counter-AI.\" The bipartisan bill, introduced by Mark Warner and Thom Tillis, a Senate Democrat and Republican, respectively, would further require agencies including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to track breaches of AI systems, whether successful or not. (The NIST currently maintains the National Vulnerability Database, a repository for vulnerability data, while the CISA oversees the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program, which similarly identifies and catalogues publicly disclosed malware and other threats.)\nThe Senate bill, known as the Secure Artificial Intelligence Act, aims to expand the government's threat monitoring to include \"adversarial machine learning\"\u2014a term that is essentially synonymous with \"counter-AI\"\u2014which serves to subvert AI systems and \u201Cpoison\u201D their data using techniques vastly dissimilar to traditional modes of cyberwarfare.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/663563ad231b4f48281342dd\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/A-New-Surveillance-Tool-Invades-Border-Towns-Security-GettyImages-2149617416.jpg","author":"BY DHRUV MEHROTRA","title":"A New Surveillance Tool Invades Border Towns","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/border-surveillance-india-assassination-project-nimbus-security-roundup\/","tags":["","SECURITY ROUNDUP","ENCRYPTION","SECURITY","CYBERSECURITY","HACKING","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","SURVEILLANCE","PRIVACY"]},{"date":"05.01.2024","summary":"Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, MIT, and IBM have released a new AI model\u2014and the 200-million-transaction dataset it's trained on\u2014that aims to spot the \u201Cshape\u201D of bitcoin money laundering.","post_content":"One task where AI tools have proven to be particularly superhuman is analyzing vast troves of data to find patterns that humans can't see, or automating and accelerating the discovery of those we can.

He pulled his face mask below his chin for the security camera. Surely he was nervous. The 27-year-old had unruly black hair, a boy-band face, and a patchy beard. Normally he overcompensated for his callow features by dressing in a pressed three-piece suit. But this spring day he wore black trainers and a navy-blue sweater hastily pulled over a white polo shirt, as if he had dressed in a dash. A small backpack was slung over his right shoulder. He looked like someone who could have been going on a last-minute day trip\u2014or someone planning to never come back. At 5:57 pm on April 20, 2021, the guard stamped his Turkish passport and Özer shuffled through the crowd to Gate C, a flash drive containing a rumored $2 billion in crypto stashed in his belongings.\nAfter Özer\u2019s plane reached Tirana, Albania, at 9:24 that night, he checked into the Mondial, a popular 4-star business hotel in the capital\u2019s commercial district. A couple of days later, he looked at his social media accounts. A mob was very angry with him: Customers couldn\u2019t access their money on the exchange Thodex, where he was founder and CEO, and people were accusing him of absconding with their funds.\nÖzer posted a public letter to his company\u2019s website and his social accounts. \u201CI feel compelled to make this statement in order to respond urgently to these allegations,\u201D he wrote. The accusations weren\u2019t true, he said. Thodex\u2014which had nearly half a million investors and $500 million in daily trade volume\u2014was investigating what Özer claimed was a suspected cyberattack that caused \u201Can abnormal fluctuation in the company account.\u201D Assets would be frozen for five days while Thodex resolved the issue. This was terribly bad timing for the big business deal he said he was en route to make: selling the company, or so he had told some employees and his brother and sister before he left. All would be made right. \u201CThere will be no victims,\u201D he promised. \u201CI personally declare that I will return to Turkey within a few days and ensure that the facts are revealed in cooperation with judicial authorities and that I will do my best to prevent users from suffering.\u201D Of course, there was this possibility too: He was in the midst of pulling off the biggest heist in Turkey\u2019s history.\nPHOTOGRAPH: GETTY IMAGESBefore dawn the day after Özer posted the letter, police squads fanned out across Istanbul and public prosecutors opened an investigation. Law enforcement arrested 62 people, including Thodex employees at all levels of the company\u2014and Özer\u2019s older brother and sister, Güven and Serap. Interpol issued a red notice, a request for law enforcement worldwide to find and \u201Cprovisionally arrest\u201D Özer pending his extradition to Turkey. Search teams deployed across Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia. There were reported sightings of the dark-haired young man across Tirana, rumors that he had gone to a poultry farm, that an executive from the Albanian football league was sheltering him. Soon, the Albanian police arrested people accused of aiding and abetting him. But no one seemed to know exactly where Özer was.\nBackgammon cafés, where old men have been drinking tea and talking politics for centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip.\nÖzer had vanished at a particularly precarious time in crypto\u2019s annals: In the weeks leading up to his disappearance, so-called rug pulls\u2014when a cryptocurrency exchange or altcoin developer absconds with investors\u2019 funds\u2014had crypto investors around the globe flabbergasted. The CEO of Mirror Trading International, a crypto trading company based in South Africa, defrauded users of more than $1 billion, then skipped town; TurtleDex, an anonymous decentralized finance storage project on Binance, reportedly vanished with $2.4 million; another decentralized finance project, Meerkat, reportedly fleeced investors out of $31 million (of which they paid back 95 percent). Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis ranked rug pulls as the primary scam of 2021, accounting for 37 percent of all cryptocurrency scam revenue that year, up from 1 percent the year before.\nThodex was at the top of that roster, and nearly every major outlet from Bloomberg to Newsweek published headlines like \u201CTurkish Crypto Exchange Goes Bust as Founder Flees Country\u201D and \u201CTurkish Cryptocurrency Founder Faruk Fatih Özer Seen Fleeing Country With Suspected $2 Billion From Investors.\u201D CoinGeek called it \u201Cthe biggest scam in the digital asset industry in 2021.\u201D The New York Times\u2019 headline read, \u201CPossible Cryptocurrency Fraud Is Another Blow to Turkey\u2019s Financial Stability.\u201D In Turkey, the country I now call home, people were reeling: For years, crypto had been built up\u2014largely by Özer but by others too\u2014as a way out of economic volatility. Now it seemed like just another way to lose your life savings. But something felt off to me, like the whole story wasn\u2019t being told.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRFaruk was born in February 1994, the youngest of three. He was inseparable from his brother, Güven, and sister, Serap. They grew up camping, playing video games, and cooking together. Friends always pointed out their shared sense of humor. His parents ran a print and copy shop in the city of Kocaeli, down the street from their house. They were observant Muslims who gave their children meaningful names: \u201Ctrust\u201D (Güven), \u201Cmirage\u201D (Serap), and \u201Cthe one who distinguishes between right and wrong\u201D (Faruk).\nKocaeli is an industrial port town about 100 kilometers east of Istanbul surrounded by a checkerboard of tobacco and sugar beet fields, petrochemical plants, and paper mills. Roman emperors once lived there, and their crumbling fortress walls still wind through the landscape. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed, Kocaeli became a manufacturing boomtown, and its residents muscled the newly minted Republic of Turkey into the Industrial Revolution.\nWhen Özer was born, Turkey\u2019s economy was in a tailspin. A fragile financial system, irresponsible borrowing, and political corruption had triggered a brief period of triple-digit inflation. The lira\u2019s volatility threatened the savings of its entire population. So many people moved their domestic assets to foreign-currency deposits that, by the end of the year, an astonishing 50 percent of bank deposits in Turkey were in a foreign currency. The year before, that figure was just 1 percent.\nThat same month Özer was born, a charismatic orator with a sympathetic gaze and push-broom mustache began campaigning through Istanbul\u2019s streets in a paisley kipper tie. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan railed against the secular elite who had led the country to near economic collapse. A devout Muslim, he walked the streets of his home neighborhood, Kasımpaşa, a hardscrabble district where he grew up selling simit, or sesame bread, promising reform. In an upset election, he coasted into the role of mayor of Istanbul.\nAround the same time, two Turkish business moguls launched Turkcell, the nation\u2019s first mobile communication system. (This was a year and a half before the same technology was released in the US.) By 2003, Erdoğan was elected prime minister, kicking off a decade of unprecedented growth that foreign observers called Turkey\u2019s \u201CSilent Revolution.\u201D In a turn away from his predecessors, he governed through the lens of a businessman, inaugurating a massive building boom across the country and ultimately wrangling Turkey\u2019s rampant inflation. His pro-business rhetoric boosted the middle class and set Turkey on a path to European Union membership.\nÖzer also caught the spirit of entrepreneurship at an early age. As a teenager in the mid-aughts, he worked after-school shifts at his parents\u2019 print shop. \u201CEver since I was a child, I wanted to do my own business, no matter what sector it was,\u201D he said. At the end of his second year in high school, he decided that further study would not lead him to that dream, so he dropped out.\nBy 2013, Turkey\u2019s gross domestic product had nearly tripled, the lira hovered just above the dollar, and the country was negotiating entry into the EU. BtcTurk, Turkey\u2019s first crypto exchange (and reportedly the world\u2019s fourth), was preparing to launch. Then, in May of that year, a group of activists gathered at Gezi Park in Istanbul to protest plans to redevelop it into a shopping mall with Ottoman-era architecture. They bridled not only at the loss of green space but also at the glorification of Turkey\u2019s Islamist past in a society that called itself secular. Police brutally cracked down on the protesters, sparking a nationwide movement. Within weeks, more than 3 million people had taken part in the demonstrations, their frustration now encompassing the growing authoritarianism of Erdoğan\u2019s government. Thousands were injured, and at least five died. Özer had just turned 19. In the following years, Erdoğan tossed a record number of journalists in jail and censored the internet, and foreign investors recoiled.Around that time, Ismail H. Polat, an expert in engineering, information tech, and new media, was the first person to cover crypto on his YouTube channel. Now a lecturer at Istanbul\u2019s Kadir Has University, the way he tells it, crypto was about trying to be financially free. In those early days, he says, \u201Cit was not the coin, but the spirit.\u201D (After all, bitcoin was worth only $77 at the time.) For young people who felt that Erdoğan had pulled the rug out from under them, whether they knew it explicitly or not, crypto was a new way to protest.\nAt the same time, Özer\u2019s generation was watching as tech startups were taking off around the world. Facebook had bought Instagram for $1 billion, and that spurred entrepreneurs to begin churning out apps. A lot of them were gaming-focused; Candy Crush brought in $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013. The Özers took note.\nBy then, Turkcell had become one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Turkey\u2019s mobile infrastructure and smartphone adoption rate became one of the fastest growing in the world. Polat credits this as the foundation for what came next: The dream began to shift from mere employment to entrepreneurship. Güven cofounded a company called Inline Yazılım; Faruk started one called Inline Teknoloji a few years later and another called Game Bridge after that. The brothers figured out how to crank out chintzy apps\u2014cut-and-paste washboard abs for Instagram photos (pre-vanity-filters era) and addictive gambling games. \u201CI started to sell almost every product that I thought could make a profit on the internet,\u201D he told me. \u201CThis is how I took my first step into business life.\u201D\nBY 2017, 14 years into Erdoğan\u2019s rule, Turkey\u2019s economy had come full circle. Erdoğan\u2019s unorthodox economic policies\u2014repeatedly cutting interest rates\u2014were supposed to raise investment and make Turkey less dependent on foreign powers. Instead they led the country into an economic crisis; the value of the lira hit the skids, and after a failed coup attempt in 2016 people figured it would only get worse. Just as they had 23 years earlier, citizens began searching for places to shelter their money. Voilà, 2017 was also the first year bitcoin\u2019s value shot sky high, from $9,000 to $20,000. Global trade volume also skyrocketed from $99 million to $16 billion.\nBeing early investors in tech wasn\u2019t something that had historically been available to the average person in Turkey. The instant millionaires and billionaires and unicorns pretty much lived elsewhere. Now, Faruk Özer saw a possibility. People in Turkey could shelter their money in what was clearly going to be the next big tech boom. But the biggest opportunity wasn\u2019t in trading coins\u2014it was in running a cryptocurrency exchange. Exchanges collect people\u2019s money and, for a commission, invest it; that gives people who don\u2019t have the time or skills to invest directly into the blockchain a pathway to crypto. Users who go through an exchange don\u2019t even have their own digital wallets; their money is stored until they withdraw it. (Hence the industry warning: \u201CNot your wallet, not your coins.\u201D)\u201CDuring conversations with friends, we realized the deficiencies in the cryptocurrency exchange sector in Turkey and that the market was open to new players,\u201D Özer said. There were no regulations on running a cryptocurrency exchange; Özer could open one easier than he could open a simit stand. He could become rich. Everybody might become rich. So at the age of 23, Özer founded Thodex with 40,000 lira\u2014around $11,100 at the time\u2014of his own money. Soon, Serap began working for Özer as a company accountant; Güven too seemed to be around a lot, but his ties were unofficial.\nUsing a playbook from Silicon Valley, Özer began spreading the gospel of crypto around Turkey. By this time, there were a few other notable exchanges, but Özer gave crypto a face and a ubiquitous presence. He put up ads on billboards and at bus stations; he installed Turkey\u2019s first bitcoin ATM in a luxury mall in Istanbul\u2019s posh Nişantaşı neighborhood, more as a stunt than anything. In a TV interview, he explained, \u201CPeople realized that it is a technology that they can turn into cash at any time. One of the most important helping tools in the spread of this perception was undoubtedly bitcoin ATMs.\u201D He aired television commercials pushing Thodex, featuring a dozen Turkish celebrities, including actress Pınar Deniz and pop star Simge. That caught the attention of Turkey\u2019s middle and upper classes.\nIn 2020, the company secured a money services business license from the US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Özer paraded it around like a trophy.\nSoon, Özer was ingratiated into the upper echelons of Turkish society. He was invited to sit on the board of organizations such as Blockchain Turkey, a respected crypto nonprofit in Istanbul, alongside the country\u2019s biggest bankers. He was attending private meetings with Turkey\u2019s highest ministers. He appeared regularly on news channels and in tech blogs. At one point, Thodex was hacked for many millions of lira (supposedly $14 million US), allegedly from an IP address in China. Özer says he compensated the customers\u2019 losses out of his own pocket and reported the theft to the Istanbul Public Prosecutor\u2019s cybercrime unit. Experts from regulating agencies audited Thodex\u2019s financial infrastructure\u2014and Özer claimed they gave the company a clean bill of health. (Though that couldn't be confirmed.)\nIstanbul began to feel like Las Vegas. Dazzling billboards and banners hawking crypto coins were everywhere. Backgammon cafés, where old men have been drinking tea and talking politics for centuries, buzzed with crypto gossip. Signs appeared on barber shops and storefronts advising customers that they could pay with bitcoin. Bitcoin booths opened in the Grand Bazaar, next to the gold-trading stalls where people once sheltered their money when empires collapsed. By 2020, Turkey had more people using cryptocurrency than almost anywhere else in the world. Istanbul had concluded a sweeping economic metamorphosis, from a historic trading post to an information technology leader to one of the top mobile gaming centers on the planet. And finally to a cryptocurrency capital. Crypto \u201Ctransformed into a national mindset\u201D among young people, Polat says.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRHe added, though: \u201CMoney is an agreement between a government and its society in terms of national unity. But on the other side of the medallion, if everyone leaves the fiat\u2014if everyone leaves the social agreement of their nation\u2014it could derail the world.\u201D\nIn 2020, Thodex moved into a sprawling high-rise in Kadıköy, a chockablock district on the Asian side of Istanbul. It had a big open floor plan and views of the Marmara Sea. Thodex was now the fastest-growing and second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey. In the office, Özer had a reputation for keeping to himself. His 85 employees, most of whom applied for their jobs at Thodex through ads on platforms like LinkedIn, say they were paid on time, received bonuses, got their time-off requests approved quickly, and enjoyed the Thodex-branded coffee mugs and other swag. But the young man in charge clearly had some bluster. One former employee told me Özer\u2019s avatar on the in-house messaging system was an image of Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character from The Wolf of Wall Street.\nLike any CEO, Özer wanted to make it as easy as possible for customers to spend money on his products. He started a customer service center called Thodex Academy that offered an introductory guide to cryptocurrencies for new investors. He offered scandalously cheap commission rates, so low that industry experts were stumped as to how Thodex could be making a profit. The company also allowed people to buy crypto via credit cards; at times that was money an investor didn\u2019t really have, but the hope was that a coin\u2019s value would go up faster than the interest accrued on the card. (The US Securities and Exchange Commission was alerting the public to avoid crypto exchanges promoting the practice.)\nÖzer was also intent on taking Thodex global. In 2020, the company secured a money services business license from the US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Özer endlessly paraded it around like a trophy, touting it in news interviews, on Thodex\u2019s website, and on social media. Like the audit a few years earlier, the license seemed to prove that Thodex was legit\u2014that it had passed all the record-keeping and anti-money-laundering checks, that it was a company people could trust.\nBy March 2021, 16 percent of people in Turkey were using crypto, putting the nation in the top five for crypto use, along with Nigeria, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Peru\u2014all countries with struggling economies.\nThe value of the lira, meanwhile, was at a historic low\u2014as was Erdoğan\u2019s approval rating. In April, Turkey\u2019s Central Bank announced a ban on the use of crypto for purchases or services, set to go into effect later that month. This sent a shock wave across the global crypto market. (Bitcoin\u2019s value dropped 4.6 percent.) The central bank issued a statement saying bitcoin could \u201Ccause non-recoverable losses.\u201D It also said bitcoin\u2019s use could undermine confidence in the lira. The bank and Erdoğan promised more regulations to follow. Özer\u2019s entire empire was under threat.Özer had, for a few months, been running a PR blitz for Thodex\u2019s fourth birthday, giving away iPhones, PlayStations, a Porsche Panamera, and Dogecoins. It worked\u2014sort of. Thodex\u2019s trade volume reportedly climbed to $538 million. At the same time, the price of bitcoin soared again, reaching a high of $63,000. If there ever was a ripe moment to flee with Thodex\u2019s cold wallet, this was it. Days later, Özer stood at the Istanbul Airport, a ticket to Tirana in his hands.\nAS \u201CWANTED\u201D FLIERS with Özer\u2019s picture went up on telephone poles across Albania, Erdoğan held a Q&A with college students from all over the country and talked about his \u201Cwar\u201D with crypto. The outlook for Thodex\u2019s 400,000 customers was grim. So many Thodex investors had put all of their money into Özer\u2019s company\u2014and all of their spouses\u2019, parents\u2019, in-laws\u2019, and kids\u2019 money too. They had taken out loans and lines of credit to buy more crypto.\nOne investor named Mahmut\u2014$100,000 lost\u2014had been using Thodex for three years and was in the final stages of buying a house and car for his family. (Like so many victims, he didn\u2019t want to use his full name, because of a heavy burden of shame.) Mahmut had tried to withdraw his money\u2014a mixture of savings and loans\u2014in the days before the collapse, but it never came through. He attempted suicide three times. When his 2-year-old was diagnosed with autism, Mahmut took a job as a security guard at a storage facility to help pay for services for his son. At least two other investors were reported to have died by suicide.\nThen there were friends of the family; Güven and Serap had also recruited customers. One was a former colleague of Güven\u2019s; they had worked together through an advertising agency. Güven personally made a Thodex account for this colleague. Over time the two became friends, calling each other on birthdays. About Güven, the friend told me, \u201CHe\u2019s a nice person who likes to joke around.\u201D\nPeople were devastated about losing their life savings, but they were also plagued by the mystery of what happened to Özer; they talked about Özer haunting them in recurring dreams.\nBut when he saw the maintenance notice on Thodex\u2019s website, he called Güven to ask about withdrawing his money. \u201CHis phone was off, and would never turn on again after that,\u201D he said. \u201CI believed in it. It had public credibility. It had a license. It had an office. Tax registration number. Employees. It checked out as a reputable company,\u201D he said. He lost $7,900\u2014but, worse than that, he said, \u201CI trusted it so much that I recommended Thodex to many friends, and they all lost their money too.\u201D\nVictims formed support groups online. People were devastated about losing their life savings, but they were also plagued by the mystery of what happened to Özer; they talked about Özer haunting them in recurring dreams. People questioned how Özer\u2014this self-made 27-year-old who didn\u2019t quite fit the profile of a tech bro or a transnational cybercriminal\u2014could engineer the biggest theft Turkey had ever seen all by himself.\nTwo months after the collapse, Sedat Peker, an infamous, self-exiled mafia boss turned YouTuber, inflamed the situation with a series of cryptic posts on his YouTube channel and Twitter, accusing Turkey\u2019s interior minister of collusion and profiteering. (The minister denied it, but photos of Özer and him at a 2019 meeting fueled a heap of conspiracy theories.) At one point before he disappeared, Özer apparently stayed in pandemic lockdown with the son of a member of Turkey\u2019s parliament as they prepared to launch a new digital wallet service called Hoppara. A lawyer representing some victims speculated on a phone call with me that Thodex was actually a money laundering scheme, that Özer was just a puppet, and some other power was pulling the strings. Others I spoke with echoed this theory, and more than a few people strongly cautioned me to stop my reporting. Soon I started receiving anonymous threats.Some vigilante programmers tried to trace the blockchain to see if they could find out if this was the work of one individual, a criminal network, or a vulnerable system. (As the joke about people who steal money and blame it on hackers goes, \u201CI lost my bitcoin in a boating accident.\u201D) They came up short. While others looked for the money, I decided to search for Özer. He reminded me of the young founders I used to interview in San Francisco when I was covering tech in 2013\u2014ambitious, naive, and at times loose with ethics. Also, what aspiring fugitive would say where they were absconding to and then post letters from the road? So I booked a ticket for Tirana, the last place Özer was seen.\nTwo days later my apartment in Istanbul was ransacked in a way that seemed like a stern message. The wood on my front door was split open by force, and the contents of every drawer and cabinet were tossed around. The lock to a safe was snipped open, its contents\u2014expensive camera equipment and cash\u2014remained untaken. Even a laptop on the entry table appeared untouched. I canceled the trip.\nNEARLY ONE YEAR after he disappeared, there was no sign of Özer or the money. Rumors flew that he was no longer in Albania. He could be in a hotel in Montenegro, a yacht off Kosovo, or a tropical hideaway in Thailand, people said; or he could be locked in a Tirana basement. People told me they thought he was dead, resting in a shallow grave.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIR\nGüven and Serap idled in prison, awaiting their brother\u2019s capture so that their trial could begin. In March 2022, Istanbul\u2019s public prosecutor and Turkey\u2019s Financial Crimes Board released the findings of their investigation. They painted Özer as a rapacious mountebank who used star-powered pitchmen to dupe people into funneling their savings into his criminal organization. The report asserted that, in 2017, Özer founded Thodex with the intention of operating it as a crime ring for money laundering and that every employee was a willing part of it\u2014from the top executives down to the call-center workers who were placating customers and the social media managers who lured victims with promotions and sweepstakes.The report traced scads of transactions through a shadowy web of financial accounts all allegedly under Özer\u2019s control. It said that about $8 million in Thodex-held assets had been cashed out in gold bricks in Malta a few weeks before Özer\u2019s disappearance. Özer might have escaped, but his employees and family were facing the possibility of spending many lifetimes in prison.\nJust as hope of Özer\u2019s resurfacing dwindled, the drama took a new twist: Sevgi Erarslan, a lawyer whom Özer\u2019s father had hired initially to pay the victims back, then to represent his son in absentia, introduced herself to Twitter via a shocking tweet: She said she would refund any victims of Thodex if they legally withdrew their complaint against her client.\nA wave of questions followed\u2014where was this money coming from, and was Özer not just alive but in contact with Erarslan while wanted by Interpol? I sent her an email asking if I could speak with Özer. To my surprise, she called me immediately, saying that Özer was willing to be in touch. We began an occasional correspondence, though I often wondered if he really was the person answering my questions, if he was even really alive.\nThe trial went forward under a swirl of confusion and skepticism\u2014about Özer\u2019s whereabouts, about the large payments now being sent to victims from undisclosed sources, and about Erarslan\u2019s legitimacy as his official lawyer. Of the 62 people who had been initially arrested, 21 were charged. On an overcast July morning, officers escorted those defendants into Istanbul\u2019s beige brutalist courthouse, just a short walk from the Thodex headquarters where all the people on trial had once worked.\nGüven wore a dark olive blazer, and his mustache was trimmed into a neat chevron. Serap sat with her back turned to him, cloaked in a trench coat pulled over a midnight black abaya. Özer\u2019s lawyer, Erarslan, wore Turkey\u2019s satin lawyer cloak and carried a Louis Vuitton purse. The sound of dozens of handcuffs being unhitched echoed through the cavernous room.\nWhen Güven\u2019s name was called, he stood, flanked by two crew-cut court officers sporting the dark irony of his name emblazoned on their vests (\u201CGüvenlik\u201D means \u201Csecurity\u201D). He told the court that he had no official ties to Thodex. \u201CI only come to the office for tea with my siblings,\u201D he said. He explained how Thodex subcontracted his company for advertising services, and added: \u201CMy brother asked me to give him my personal account that I wasn\u2019t using, so I let him use it.\u201D Saying that his brother told him he was going to Albania to try to sell the company, he corroborated Faruk\u2019s claim.\nWithout looking at her brother, Serap rose and explained that she was only an accountant; her job was to forward documents to an accounting firm. Like Güven, she had given Faruk her personal crypto exchange and bank account information at his request. \u201CI didn\u2019t think he was going to use it,\u201D Serap said. \u201CI can\u2019t say that my brother opened those fake accounts in my name. Identity theft is common; it could have been anyone.\u201D The head judge twirled her pen as Serap spoke, her voice sputtering and cracking. \u201CI have been suffering from both physiological and psychological problems. I am so worn out physically.\u201D When she began losing her breath and stumbling over her sentences, the judge excused her from the stand.Özer\u2019s siblings and former employees told the court about Özer\u2019s request for access to scores of other accounts where he could personally initiate trades. To the prosecutors\u2014and probably plenty of other people listening\u2014this looked a lot like evidence of money laundering.\nWhen the presiding judge called Özer\u2019s name, Erarslan stood to testify on his behalf, waving a handwritten power of attorney, claiming to be able to represent the missing CEO. The judge shut her down, saying that the document was invalid.\nOne of the victims\u2019 lawyers stood up and shouted that Erarslan should be kicked out of the courtroom. Erarslan shouted back. The room erupted into a circus. Judges and lawyers, victims and defendants\u2014all volleyed slurs and accusations at one another. One of the defendants\u2019 lawyers yelled at the judge: \u201CYou need to know how crypto works. To have a fair trial you have to understand how crypto works.\u201D\nLATE ONE AUGUST night in 2022, a few days before the defendants back in Istanbul were to receive their verdicts, it became clear that Özer was very much alive. The Albanian police had been tailing a BMW X5 that they suspected was Özer\u2019s and traced the car to an elegant two-story art-deco villa in the hills of Vlorë, a ritzy tourist town on what\u2019s billed as the Albanian Riviera.\nJust outside the driveway, they pulled over and waited. At 2:30 am, two people left the house and got into the BMW and started to pull out of the driveway. The cops stopped it, arrested two young men, and a police squad in bulletproof vests and balaclavas stormed the villa. In video footage taken of the raid, Özer, shirtless and wearing red shorts, looks shocked. He stumbles around the room. On a wall behind him, liquor bottles line the shelves. Three women were in the villa too. An officer grabbed Özer, and the young CEO, now wearing a white polo shirt, was handcuffed, escorted down a short flight of stairs, shuttled into an unmarked white van, and driven into the night.\nAt the police station in Tirana, Özer told the cops that he had been \u201Chiding in the streets of poor neighborhoods.\u201D He added that he got around by bus. \u201CSince I grew up in a poor neighborhood in Turkey, I know how to deal with poor people. I looked for a house to rent by asking people on the streets.\u201D He also said that he had been living off of $10,000 in cash he had brought into the country and money that was occasionally being wired to him\u2014plus, some crypto trading. He confessed that he planned on eventually escaping to Greece.\nFor nearly a year, Özer sat in an Albanian prison, appealing his extradition back to Turkey. \u201CWe are trying to explain to the court that if I am extradited, I do not have a chance to get a fair trial,\u201D he wrote to me. He called the trial \u201Ctragicomic.\u201D His appeal was unsuccessful. In June 2023 he arrived at Istanbul Superior Court. His head was shaved; he still had the scruffy beard. The once buoyant tech founder was now staring down a prison sentence that could carry an astonishing 43,000 years.When he finally stood before the court, judges allowed Özer to tell his story. Leaping at the chance, he powered up a presentation full of images and graphics, something not dissimilar to a pitch deck. Then he started to read from a 60-page soliloquy, his defense attorney clicking through slides at his instruction.\n\u201CI did not defraud anyone, I did not smuggle money abroad, I did not establish or manage a criminal organization,\u201D he said with both frustration and sincerity in his voice. \u201CI started a company.\u201D He recognized people got hurt. Then he began trying to make a case that prosecutors (and the media) had simply, mistakenly, criminalized a business failure.\nHe mentioned a litany of those supposed problems: getting hacked, an \u201Catomic bomb\u201D of Dogecoin panic buying and selling that drained Thodex\u2019s funds after the central bank announced its drastic curtailing of crypto. \u201CThe day I bought my ticket to go to Albania, most of the Dogecoin withdrawal requests could no longer be met,\u201D he said. In his retelling, Özer arrived at the conclusion that the company itself was worth more than the funds in its wallet, so he saw only one way out: selling it. He started, he said, shopping it around in Istanbul, Italy, and the Balkans. He eventually set up meetings with several potential buyers in Albania. He didn\u2019t give their names. Özer showed the courtroom a news clip with the widely circulated headline that he had fled with $2 billion and defrauded 400,000 people. \u201CAs soon as this news started to appear, both investors were off the table \u2026 I had no other chance to cover the losses of the stolen cryptocurrencies.\u201D He pointed out that the indictment estimated the damages were closer to $43 million and the number of official claimants against him totaled 2,027 people.\nThen his testimony took a Shakespearean turn. \u201CThis was also done with the aim of killing me or having me killed,\u201D he said without flinching. \u201CTo announce to the world that a 27-year-old man with $2 billion in his pocket is alone in a country with high crime rates like Albania.\u201D That, coupled with a red notice from Interpol on his back, and his face on wanted posters around Albania, made him fear for his life. So, he said, he bought a tent and took a taxi to the southern Albanian coastline. He had hoped to ride out the nightmare camping alone. \u201CI needed time for the truth to emerge,\u201D he told the room.\nILLUSTRATION: PRINCESS HIDIRHe told the court that he grew his beard down to his clavicle, shaved his head. He said that when he learned about the prosecutor\u2019s indictment\u2014that his brother and sister were charged with fraud, that they would stand trial in a month, and that without Özer they would most likely take the blame for Thodex\u2019s fall and spend the rest of their lives in prison\u2014he had a wild idea: If every claimant were paid back, did a crime ever really happen? He did, in fact, have the Thodex cold wallet on him, he told the judges, though he claims to not remember how much was in it. He asked Erarslan to help him pay back the roughly 2,000 plaintiffs who had lost their money.\nAnd they did, in part. In total, while on the run, he paid approximately 185 million lira ($10 million at the time) to more than 1,000 claimants. As Özer tells it, when the cold wallet was empty, he threw it into the Ionian Sea.\nWhen he addressed his use of other people\u2019s accounts to trade crypto\u2014an action at the center of the case\u2014he started to sound defiant and a little condescending: \u201CStartup founders take all responsibilities, as the nature of startups requires,\u201D he said. He underscored that they had no authority in the company and no access to these accounts. \u201CThere is no lawlessness or irregularity. Moreover, I am neither the first nor the last nor the only person to arbitrage the cryptocurrency market.\u201D\nThe draconian sentence is punishment not only for a crime but also for shining a spotlight on decades of embarrassing failures.\nNear the end of his address, Özer\u2019s frustrations seemed to turn to bitterness and hubris. He faced the judges and said it was \u201Cabsurd to think that the IQ level of the person who made such a stupid escape plan\u201D was the same as that of a criminal mastermind allegedly capable of deceiving Turkish financial regulators for four years. \u201CI am smart enough to lead any institution on earth,\u201D Özer said. Then he had Erarslan pull up an image of a cartoon mocking the court. Visibly annoyed, the chief judge ordered him to remove it.\nThe verdict came quietly on a balmy Thursday in September 2023 to an almost empty courtroom. Özer stood and solemnly read the lyrics from a Turkish folk song, \u201CThe End of the Road Is Visible.\u201D\nThe chief judge handed Güven, Serap, and Özer the same sentence: 11,196 years in prison\u2014for establishing and managing a criminal organization and laundering assets. Most of the other defendants were released. It was the longest sentence in Turkey\u2019s history, handed out the month before the Republic\u2019s centennial.\nFARUK FATIH ÖZER became a poster child of crypto crimes, but he also became an accidental representation of a particular economic era\u2014and the lengths people will go through to flee it. To the Turkish regime, he was not so much an opponent as an unfortunate product of flawed economic policies. In that light, the draconian sentence is punishment not only for a crime but also for shining a spotlight on decades of embarrassing failures, ones that were made clear to the entire country the day that Özer disappeared.\nSo perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Turkey remains a haven for cryptocurrencies. In the year after Thodex went bust, inflation in the country hit a 24-year high of 85.5 percent. Prices for goods nearly doubled\u2014and so did the percentage of Turks who owned bitcoin, ether, and other currencies. In terms of trade volume, the country ranks fourth globally, behind the US, the UK, and India. After decades of watching their currency devalue, their businesses and nest eggs get scrambled, the Turkish people aren\u2019t going to pass up the dream so easily. Earlier this year, the country\u2019s finance minister said the government was working to finalize new regulations on crypto, \u201Cto make this field safer and to eliminate possible risks.\u201D So although Özer picked a fight with an authoritarian regime and lost\u2014whether because he believed too fully in the gospel of decentralization, because he was a naive kid, because he was a cynical hustler, or some combination of all three\u2014the flames of economic revolution that he helped fan aren\u2019t going out anytime soon.\nAdditional reporting by Beril Eski, Gülşah Karadağ, and Vladimir Karaj.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Now, a dispute within the criminal underground has revealed a new development in that unfolding debacle: One of the partners of the hackers behind the attack points out that those hackers, a group known as AlphV or BlackCat, received a $22 million transaction that looks very much like a large ransom payment.\nOn March 1, a Bitcoin address connected to AlphV received 350 bitcoins in a single transaction, or close to $22 million based on exchange rates at the time. Then, two days later, someone describing themselves as an affiliate of AlphV\u2014one of the hackers who work with the group to penetrate victim networks\u2014posted to the cybercriminal underground forum RAMP that AlphV had cheated them out of their share of the Change Healthcare ransom, pointing to the publicly visible $22 million transaction on Bitcoin's blockchain as proof.\nThey Cracked the Code to a Locked USB Drive Worth $235 Million in Bitcoin. Then It Got Weird\nStefan Thomas lost the password to an encrypted USB drive holding 7,002 bitcoins. One team of hackers believes they can unlock it\u2014if they can get Thomas to let them.\nBY ANDY GREENBERG\nThat suggests, according to Dmitry Smilyanets, the researcher for security firm Recorded Future who first spotted the post, that Change Healthcare has likely paid AlphV's ransom. \u201CYou can see the number of coins that landed there. You don\u2019t see that kind of transaction so often,\u201D Smilyanets says. \u201CThere\u2019s proof of a large amount landing in the AlphV-controlled Bitcoin wallet. And this affiliate connects this address to the attack on Change Healthcare. So it\u2019s likely that the victim paid the ransom.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nJavier Bardem Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions\nA spokesperson for Change Healthcare, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group, declined to answer whether it had paid a ransom to AlphV, telling WIRED only that \u201Cwe are focused on the investigation right now.\u201D\nBoth Recorded Future and TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm, connect the Bitcoin address that received the $22 million payment to the AlphV hackers. TRM Labs says it can link the address to payments from two other AlphV victims in January.\nIf Change Healthcare did pay a $22 million ransom, it would not only represent a huge payday for AlphV, but also a dangerous precedent for the health care industry, argues Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused researcher with security firm Emsisoft. Every ransomware payment, he says, both funds future attacks by the group responsible and suggests to other ransomware predators that they should try the same playbook\u2014in this case, attacking health care services that patients depend on.\n\u201CIf Change did pay, it's problematic,\u201D says Callow. \u201CIt highlights the profitability of attacks on the health care sector. Ransomware gangs are nothing if not predictable: If they find a particular sector to be lucrative, they\u2019ll attack it over and over again, rinse and repeat.\u201D\nThe self-described AlphV affiliate who first posted evidence of the payment on RAMP, and who goes by the name \u201Cnotchy,\u201D complained that AlphV had apparently collected the $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare and then kept the entire sum, rather than share the profits with their hacking partner as they had allegedly agreed. \u201CBe careful everyone and stop deal with ALPHV,\" notchy wrote.That affiliate hacker also wrote that in their penetration of Change Healthcare's network, they had accessed the data of numerous other health care firms partnered with the company. If that claim is accurate, Recorded Future's Smilyanets points out, it creates the additional risk that the affiliate hacker still possesses sensitive medical information. Even if Change Healthcare did pay AlphV, the hacker affiliate could still demand additional payment or leak the data independently.\n\u201CThe affiliates still have this data, and they\u2019re mad they didn\u2019t receive this money,\u201D says Smilyanets. \u201CIt\u2019s a good lesson for everyone. You cannot trust criminals; their word is worth nothing.\u201D\nAs ransomware payments go, $22 million would represent a remarkably profitable score for AlphV. Only a relatively small number of ransoms in the history of ransomware, such as the $40 million payment made by the financial firm CNA to the hackers known as Evil Corp, have been so large, says Emsisoft's Callow. \u201CIt\u2019s not without precedent, but it\u2019s certainly very unusual,\u201D he says.\nRegardless of whether Change Healthcare is confirmed to have paid that ransom, the attack shows that AlphV has pulled off a disturbing comeback: In December, it was the target of an FBI operation that seized its dark web sites and released decryption keys that foiled its attacks on hundreds of victims. Just two months later, it carried out the cyberattack that paralyzed Change Healthcare, triggering an outage whose effects on pharmacies and their patients have now stretched well beyond a week. As of last Tuesday, AlphV listed 28 companies on the dark web site it uses to extort its victims, not including Change Healthcare.\nThat site has now gone offline. As of Tuesday morning, it displayed what appeared to be a law enforcement seizure notice, but security researcher Fabian Wosar points out that the notice seems to have been copied from AlphV's last takedown. The reason for the group's disappearance\u2014whether due to another law enforcement operation or AlphV's attempts to dodge its own cheated affiliates\u2014is unclear. Ransomware trackers say AlphV has disappeared and rebranded several times before. Earlier incarnations under the name BlackCat, BlackMatter, and Darkside were all more or less the same group, security researchers note.\nIn fact, the hackers working under that Darkside handle were responsible for the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that triggered the shutdown of gas transportation across the Eastern Seaboard of the US and resulted in a brief fuel shortage in some East Coast cities. In that case, too, the victims paid the hackers' ransom. \u201CIt was the hardest decision I've made,\u201D Colonial's CEO Joseph Blount later told a US congressional hearing.\nNow, it seems, some of the same hackers may have forced yet another company to make that same hard decision.\nUpdate 3\/4\/2024, 1:50 pm EST: Included additional contextual details about AlphV and related ransomware attacks.\nUpdated 3\/5\/2024, 10:30 am EST to note that AlphV's dark web site now displays what appears to be a law enforcement takedown message.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Hackers Behind the Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack Just Received a $22 Million Payment","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/alphv-change-healthcare-ransomware-payment\/","tags":["","RANSOMWARE","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME","HEALTHCARE"]},{"date":"02.21.2024","summary":"Anne Neuberger, the Biden administration\u2019s deputy national security adviser for cyber, tells WIRED about emerging cybersecurity threats\u2014and what the US plans to do about them.","post_content":"When Anne Neuberger stepped into the newly created role of deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology on the White House\u2019s National Security Council at the start of the Biden administration, she was already one of the government\u2019s most experienced cyber veterans.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY GARRETT M.

That combination has proved to be wildly popular, rocketing the total value of stablecoin transactions since 2022 past even that of Bitcoin itself.\nIt turns out, however, that as stablecoins have become popular among legitimate users over the past two years, they were even more popular among a different kind of user: those exploiting them for billions of dollars of international sanctions evasion and scams.\nAs part of its annual crime report, cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis today released new numbers on the disproportionate use of stablecoins for both of those massive categories of illicit crypto transactions over the last year. By analyzing blockchains, Chainalysis determined that stablecoins were used in fully 70 percent of crypto scam transactions in 2023, 83 percent of crypto payments to sanctioned countries like Iran and Russia, and 84 percent of crypto payments to specifically sanctioned individuals and companies. Those numbers far outstrip stablecoins' growing overall use\u2014including for legitimate purposes\u2014which accounted for 59 percent of all cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2023.\nIn total, Chainalysis measured $40 billion in illicit stablecoin transactions in 2022 and 2023 combined. The largest single category of that stablecoin-enabled crime was sanctions evasion. In fact, across all cryptocurrencies, sanctions evasion accounted for more than half of the $24.2 billion in criminal transactions Chainalysis observed in 2023, with stablecoins representing the vast majority of those transactions.\nThe attraction of stablecoins for both sanctioned people and countries, argues Andrew Fierman, Chainalysis' head of sanctions strategy, is that it allows targets of sanctions to circumvent any attempt to deny them a stable currency like the US dollar. \u201CWhether it's an individual located in Iran or a bad guy trying to launder money\u2014either way, there's a benefit to the stability of the US dollar that people are looking to obtain,\u201D Fierman says. \u201CIf you're in a jurisdiction where you don't have access to the US dollar due to sanctions, stablecoins become an interesting play.\u201D\nAs examples, Fierman points to Nobitex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange operating in the sanctioned country of Iran, as well as Garantex, a notorious exchange based in Russia that has been specifically sanctioned for its widespread criminal use. Stablecoin usage on Nobitex outstrips bitcoin by a 9:1 ratio, and on Garantex by a 5:1 ratio, Chainalysis found. That's a stark difference from the roughly 1:1 ratio between stablecoins and bitcoins on a few nonsanctioned mainstream exchanges that Chainalysis checked for comparison.\nChainalysis's chart showing the growth in stablecoins as a fraction of the value of total illicit crypto transactions over time.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINALYSISChainalysis concedes that the analysis in its report excludes some cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash that are designed to be harder or impossible to trace with blockchain analysis. It also says it based its numbers on the type of cryptocurrency sent directly to an illicit actor, which may leave out other currencies used in money laundering processes that repeatedly swap one type of cryptocurrency for another to make tracing more difficult.\nChainalysis's findings come on the heels of another report released earlier this week by United Nations researchers on the outsize role of stablecoins in illegal gambling and scam operations across East and Southeast Asia. While Chainalysis declined to break out the value of any particular stablecoin in its findings, the UN report singles out Tether, the most popular stablecoin. The report describes Tether sent through the TRON blockchain-based payment network as the \u201Cpreferred choice for regional cyberfraud operations and money launderers alike due to its stability and the ease, anonymity, and low fees of its transactions.\u201D\n\u201CPig butchering\u201D scams\u2014cons in which scammers typically trick users into sending funds into fraudulent investments\u2014consistently use Tether as the means of bilking victims, says Erin West, a deputy district attorney for California's Santa Clara County and a member of the REACT High Tech Task Force, who has long focused on crypto crime. \u201CIt\u2019s always, always, always Tether. I\u2019ve never heard of pig butchering that isn\u2019t Tether,\u201D says West. \u201CThese scammers can\u2019t risk the volatility of any of the other coins like bitcoin or ether. All they want is to move assets from the victims' hands to their own in the cheapest, easiest way possible.\u201D\nWest says that the high proportion of stablecoin use in sanctions evasion also represents a disturbing trend, given that it undermines a system meant to hold specific countries, individuals, and companies accountable for criminal behavior and violations of international law. \u201CIt's so dangerous,\u201D West says. \u201CIt enables them to have access to the very units of currency that we\u2019re trying to prevent them from accessing. This is exactly what sanctions are meant to stop, and they\u2019re able to bypass it.\u201D\nChainalysis's chart showing how stablecoins dominated cryptocurrency-based sanctions evasion and scams in 2023.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINALYSISWhen WIRED reached out to Tether Holdings\u2014the company that issues the stablecoin that shares its name\u2014it responded in a statement following publication of this article that \u201CTether proactively collaborates with global law enforcement agencies to identify and prevent illicit use of\u201D its cryptocurrency, adding that its \u201Ccommitment to the highest standards of compliance is evident in our efforts to eliminate various forms of criminal activity.\u201D\nTether argued further that it has contributed to freezing the assets of users involved in scams or found to be violating the US Treasury's sanctions lists, and noted that all of its transactions, like many cryptocurrencies, can be publicly observed on blockchains\u2014in other words, the observability that made Chainalysis's report possible. \u201CBetween our active and direct engagement with law enforcement and leveraging the transparent nature of blockchain transactions, individuals attempting to conceal their illicit financial activities face significant risks, as every transaction can be easily traced,\u201D the company's statement reads.\nTether Holdings has more flatly denied other reports of Tether's use in crime and sanctions evasion. It wrote that an October Wall Street Journal article on the subject was based on \u201Chighly erroneous interpretations of data\u201D\u2014though in that case, the company pointed to Chainalysis findings as a more accurate accounting. \u201CThere is simply no evidence that Tether has violated Sanctions laws or the Bank Secrecy Act through inadequate customer due diligence or screening practices,\u201D Tether Holdings wrote in an October 26 blog post addressing the WSJ article.\nIn contrast to most cryptocurrencies, Tether does have the capability to freeze user funds, and it said in the October blog post that since its launch in 2014, it had frozen $835 million in funds deemed to be tied to illicit activities. \u201CTether's ethos revolves around transparency, compliance, and proactive collaboration with relevant authorities worldwide,\u201D the company wrote.\nChainalysis' Fierman says that Tether's efforts to freeze criminal funds are having an impact, and more enforcement could help end stablecoins' exploitation by criminals. \u201CJust as we\u2019ve seen with compliant exchanges dominating more and more of total transaction volumes, illicit activity gets pushed to the fringes,\u201D Fierman says.\nDespite Tether's ability to freeze funds, Chainalysis' data suggests that illicit use of stablecoins has so far dwarfed those seizures. West, the prosecutor, notes that most Tether associated with crime is cashed out for another currency long before anyone identifies it. That means Tether hasn't yet come close to solving the underlying problem.\n\u201CI applaud it. I'm all for it,\u201D West says of Tether's efforts to freeze criminal assets. \u201CBut when we're talking about billions and billions of dollars in assets moving, I just think this is one piece of one piece of the puzzle. There are so many more pieces. And the bad actors are so far ahead of us.\u201D\nUpdated at 9:45 am ET, January 18, 2024, to correctly identify prosecutor Erin West's professional title and at 2:45 pm ET with a statement from Tether Holdings.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65a881dde85672802282c7a3\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/011724-security-stablecoins-sanctions-scams.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"\u2018Stablecoins\u2019 Enabled $40 Billion in Crypto Crime Since 2022","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/stablecoin-sanctions-violations-crypto-crime\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRIME","RUSSIA","IRAN"]},{"date":"01.17.2024","summary":"Once, drug dealers and money launderers saw cryptocurrency as perfectly untraceable. Then a grad student named Sarah Meiklejohn proved them all wrong\u2014and set the stage for a decade-long crackdown.","post_content":"JUST OVER A decade ago, Bitcoin appeared to many of its adherents to be the crypto-anarchist holy grail: truly private digital cash for the internet.\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency\u2019s mysterious and unidentifiable inventor, had stated in an email introducing Bitcoin that \u201Cparticipants can be anonymous.\u201D And the Silk Road dark-web drug market seemed like living proof of that potential, enabling the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal drugs and other contraband for bitcoin while flaunting its impunity from law enforcement.\nThis is the story of the revelation in late 2013 that Bitcoin was, in fact, the opposite of untraceable\u2014that its blockchain would actually allow researchers, tech companies, and law enforcement to trace and identify users with even more transparency than the existing financial system. That discovery would upend the world of cybercrime. Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world\u2019s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web\u2019s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\nThat 180-degree flip in the world\u2019s understanding of cryptocurrency\u2019s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn\u2019s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.Meiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer\u2019s mining power to 11 different mining \u201Cpools,\u201D groups that collected users\u2019 computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\nPHOTOGRAPH: PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nWalmart\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\nMeiklejohn\u2019s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists\u2019 idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous.\nA collage from Meiklejohn\u2019s research paper showing every object she bought with Bitcoin in her tracing experiments.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNAS MEIKLEJOHN PAINSTAKINGLY fiddled with bitcoins and watched the digital trails they created, she found herself having flashbacks to a particular day, decades earlier, in her mother\u2019s downtown Manhattan office. That morning, Meiklejohn and her mother had taken the subway together, all the way from their Upper West Side apartment near the American Museum of Natural History to the federal building at Foley Square, across from the city\u2019s intimidating, stone-columned courthouses.\nMeiklejohn was still in elementary school, but it was take-your-daughter-to-work day, and Meiklejohn\u2019s mother was a federal prosecutor. Over the years that followed, the elder Meiklejohn would make her career taking on contractors who were bilking the city government out of tax dollars\u2014bribing government staffers to choose overpriced school food or street-paving services\u2014or else banks colluding to sell low-performing investments to the city\u2019s financiers. Many of her targets in those corruption probes would be sentenced to years in prison.\nThat day in the Justice Department\u2019s New York office, Sarah Meiklejohn, not yet 10 years old, was put to work. She was assigned to comb through a pile of paper checks, searching for clues of a corrupt kickback scheme in one of her mother\u2019s investigations.\nIt was that feeling, the drive to manually assemble tiny data points that built into a larger picture, that would give Meiklejohn a kind of déjà vu 20 years later as she studied the Bitcoin blockchain, even before she consciously knew what she was doing.\n\u201CSomewhere in the back of my mind was this idea,\u201D says Meiklejohn, \u201Cthe idea of following the money.\u201D\nAs a child, Meiklejohn loved puzzles\u2014the more complex, the better. On road trips, in airports, or any other time the small-for-her-age, hyper-inquisitive girl needed to be distracted, her mother would hand her a book of puzzles. One of the first websites Meiklejohn remembers visiting on the nascent World Wide Web was a GeoCities page devoted to deciphering the Kryptos sculpture on the campus of the CIA, whose copper, ribbonlike surface contained four coded messages that even the cryptanalysts at Langley hadn\u2019t been able to crack. By the age of 14 she would finish the New York Times crossword puzzle every day of the week.\nOn a vacation to London, Meiklejohn\u2019s family visited the British Museum, and Meiklejohn became fixated on the Rosetta stone, along with the broader notion of ancient languages\u2014the remnants of entire cultures\u2014that could be deciphered if the puzzler simply found the right key. Soon she was reading about Linear A and Linear B, a pair of written scripts used by the Minoan civilization on Crete until roughly 1500 BC. Linear B had been deciphered only in the 1950s, thanks in large part to a classicist at Brooklyn College named Alice Kober who labored in obscurity over samples of the Bronze Age language for 20 years, writing her notes on 180,000 index cards.\nMeiklejohn became so obsessed with Linear A and B that she persuaded a teacher at her middle school to organize an evening seminar on the subject (only she and one friend attended). More tantalizing than even the story of Alice Kober\u2019s work on Linear B, for Meiklejohn, was the fact that no one had been able to decipher Linear A, even after a century of study. The best puzzles of all were the ones that had no answer key\u2014the ones for which no one even knew if a solution existed.When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201Cunbreakable\u201D system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\nMEIKLEJOHN SHOWED REAL talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority.Considering Bitcoin\u2019s mechanics for the first time, Meiklejohn was intrigued. But when she got home from the hike and began poring over Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper, it immediately became clear to her that Bitcoin\u2019s trade-offs were the exact opposite of the eCash system she knew so well. Fraud was prevented not by a kind of after-the-fact forgery analysis carried out by a bank authority but with an instantaneous check of the blockchain, the unforgeable public record of who possessed every single bitcoin.\nBut that blockchain ledger system came at an enormous privacy cost: In Bitcoin, for good and for ill, everyone was a witness to every payment. Yes, identities behind those payments were obscured by pseudonymous addresses, long strings of between 26 and 35 characters. But to Meiklejohn, this seemed like an inherently dangerous sort of fig leaf to hide behind. Unlike eCash, whose privacy protections offered snoops no hint of revealing information to latch onto, Bitcoin offered an enormous collection of data to analyze. Who could say what sorts of patterns might give away users who thought they were cleverer than those watching them?\n\u201CYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201CAnd so as a cryptographer, the natural question was, if you can\u2019t prove it\u2019s private, then what attacks are possible? If you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201D\nThe temptation was more than Meiklejohn could resist. The blockchain, like a massive, undeciphered corpus of an ancient language, hid a wealth of secrets in plain view.\nWHEN MEIKLEJOHN BEGAN digging into the blockchain in late 2012, she started with a very simple question: How many people were using bitcoin?\nThat number was much harder to pin down than it might seem. After downloading the entire blockchain onto a UCSD server and organizing it into a database that she could query, like a gargantuan, searchable spreadsheet, she could see that there were more than 12 million distinct Bitcoin addresses, among which there had been nearly 16 million transactions. But even amid all that activity, there were plenty of recognizable events in Bitcoin\u2019s history visible to the naked eye. Spenders and recipients might have been hidden behind pseudonymous addresses, but some transactions were unmistakable, like distinctive pieces of furniture hidden under thin sheets in someone\u2019s attic.\nShe could see, for instance, the nearly 1 million bitcoins that were mined by Satoshi in the early days of the cryptocurrency, before others started using it, as well as the first transaction ever made when Satoshi sent 10 coins as a test to the early Bitcoin developer Hal Finney in January 2009. She spotted, too, the first payment with real value, when a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz famously sold a friend two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in May 2010 (as of this writing worth hundreds of millions of dollars).\nPlenty of other addresses and transactions had been recognized and widely discussed on forums like Bitcointalk, and Meiklejohn spent hours cutting and pasting long strings of characters into Google to see if someone had already claimed credit for an address or if other Bitcoin users had been gossiping about certain high-value transactions. By the time Meiklejohn began to look, anyone with enough interest and patience to wade through a sea of garbled addresses could see money transfers between mysterious parties just beneath the surface of the blockchain\u2019s obfuscation that, even at the time, were often worth small fortunes.Getting beyond that obfuscation, however, was the real challenge. Sure, Meiklejohn could see transactions between addresses. But the problem was drilling down further, definitively drawing a boundary around the bitcoin hoard of any single person or organization. A user could have as many addresses as they chose to create with one of the many wallet programs that managed their coins\u2014like a bank that allows you to spread your wealth across as many accounts as you liked, creating new ones with a mouse click. Plenty of those programs even automatically generated new addresses every time the user received a bitcoin payment, adding to the confusion.\nStill, Meiklejohn was sure that searching for patterns in the mess of transactions would allow her to untangle at least some of them. In Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s own original white paper, Meiklejohn recalled that he had briefly alluded to a technique that could be used to collapse some addresses into single identities. Often, a single bitcoin transaction has multiple \u201Cinputs\u201D from different addresses. If someone wants to pay a friend 10 bitcoins but holds those coins at two different addresses of five coins each, the spender\u2019s wallet software creates a single transaction that lists the two five-coin addresses as inputs and the address receiving 10 coins as the output. To make the payment possible, the payer would need to possess both of the so-called secret keys that allow the five coins at each address to be spent. That means anyone looking at the transaction on the blockchain can reasonably identify both of the input addresses as belonging to the same person or organization.\nSatoshi had hinted at the privacy dangers this introduced. \u201CSome linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,\u201D Satoshi wrote. \u201CThe risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.\u201D\nSo, as Meiklejohn\u2019s first step, she simply tried the technique Satoshi had inadvertently suggested\u2014across every bitcoin payment ever carried out. She scanned her blockchain database for every multi-input transaction, linking all of those double, triple, or even hundredfold inputs to single identities. The result immediately reduced the number of potential Bitcoin users from 12 million to date to around 5 million, slicing away more than half of the problem.\nMeiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked.\nOnly after that initial step\u2014practically a freebie\u2014did Meiklejohn switch her brain into true puzzle-solving mode. Like a 20th-century archaeologist scanning hieroglyphics for identifiable words or phrases that might help to decipher a passage of text, she began to hunt through Bitcoin\u2019s transactions for other clues that might reveal identifying information. Messing around with bitcoin wallets\u2014making test payments to herself and her colleagues\u2014she began to understand a quirk of the cryptocurrency. Many bitcoin wallets only allowed spenders to pay the entire amount of coins sitting at a certain address. Each address was like a piggy bank that has to be smashed open to spend the coins inside. Spend less than the whole amount in that piggy bank and the leftovers have to be stored in a newly created piggy bank.\nThis second piggy bank, in Bitcoin\u2019s system, is called a \u201Cchange\u201D address: When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient\u2019s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn\u2019t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address\u2014a piggy bank that had materialized on the spot to receive leftover coins from the one that had just been shattered. And that meant these two piggy banks\u2014the spender\u2019s address and the change address\u2014must belong to the same person.\nMeiklejohn began to apply that change-making lens, looking for instances where she could link spenders and the remainders of their payments. She began to see how powerful the simple act of tracking bitcoin change could be: In instances where she couldn\u2019t distinguish a recipient address from a change address, she would be stuck at a fork in the road with no signposts. But if she could link change addresses to the addresses they had split off from, she could make her own signposts. She could follow the money despite its branching paths.\nThe result was that Meiklejohn could now link together entire chains of transactions that had previously been unlinked: A single sum of coins would move from change address to change address as the spender paid fractions of the total pile of coins in one small payment after another. The remainder of the pile might move to a fresh address with each payment, but those addresses must all represent the transactions of a single spender.\nShe\u2019d come to refer to those chains of transactions as \u201Cpeeling chains\u201D (or sometimes just \u201Cpeel chains\u201D). She thought of them like someone peeling bills off a roll of dollar bills: Though the roll of bills might be put back in a different pocket after a bill was peeled off and spent, it was still fundamentally one wad of cash with a consistent owner. Following these peeling chains opened avenues to trace the digital money\u2019s movements like never before.\nMeiklejohn now had two clever techniques, both of which were capable of linking multiple Bitcoin addresses to a single person or organization, what she came to call \u201Cclustering.\u201D What had initially looked like disparate addresses could now be connected into clusters that encompassed hundreds or, in some cases, even thousands of addresses.\nAlready, she was tracing bitcoins in ways that many of the cryptocurrency\u2019s users wouldn\u2019t have believed possible. But following coins didn\u2019t necessarily mean understanding who owned them. The identities behind those coins remained a mystery, and each of her clusters remained just as pseudonymous as the single, disconnected addresses had been originally. To put a name to those clusters, she began to realize, she\u2019d have to take a much more hands-on approach: not simply observing the artifacts of the Bitcoin economy after the fact like an archaeologist, but becoming a player in it herself\u2014in some cases, an undercover one.\nSEARCHING FOR GUIDANCE in her budding Bitcoin research, Meiklejohn turned to Stefan Savage, a UCSD professor who was on the other end of the spectrum from the deeply mathematical cryptography research Meiklejohn had spent years on. Savage was a hands-on, empirical researcher, more interested in real-world experiments with real-world results than abstractions. He had been one of the lead advisers of a now-legendary team of researchers who had first shown it was possible to hack a car over the internet, demonstrating to General Motors in 2011 that his team could remotely take over a Chevy Impala\u2019s steering and brakes via the cellular radio in its OnStar system, a shocking feat of hacker wizardry.More recently, Savage had helped lead a group that included Kirill Levchenko\u2014the scientist who\u2019d introduced Meiklejohn to Bitcoin on their desert hike\u2014working on a massively ambitious project to track the spam email ecosystem. In that research, as with the earlier car-hacking breakthrough, Savage\u2019s team hadn\u2019t been afraid to get their hands dirty: They\u2019d collected hundreds of millions of web links in junk marketing emails, mostly ones intended to sell real and fake pharmaceuticals. Then, as Savage describes it, they acted out the role of \u201Cthe world\u2019s most gullible person,\u201D using bots to click through on every one of those links to see where they led and spending more than $50,000 on the products the spammers were hawking\u2014all while working with a cooperative credit card issuer to trace the funds and see which banks ended up with the money.\nSeveral of those shady banks were ultimately shut down as a result of the researchers\u2019 tracing work. As another UCSD professor working on the project, Geoffrey Voelker, described it at the time, \u201COur secret weapon is shopping.\u201D\nSo when Meiklejohn began talking over her Bitcoin tracking project with Savage, the two agreed she should take the same approach: She would manually identify Bitcoin addresses one by one by doing transactions with them herself, like a cop on the narcotics beat carrying out buy-and-busts.\nThat\u2019s how Meiklejohn found herself in the early weeks of 2013 ordering coffee, cupcakes, trading cards, mugs, baseball hats, silver coins, socks, and a closet\u2019s worth of other truly random objects from online vendors who accepted bitcoin; joining more than a dozen mining collectives; fiendishly gambling bitcoins at every online crypto casino she could find; and moving bitcoins into and out of accounts on practically every existing bitcoin exchange\u2014and the Silk Road\u2014again and again.\nThe hundreds of addresses Meiklejohn identified and tagged manually with those 344 transactions represented only the tiniest fraction of the overall bitcoin landscape. But when she combined her address tagging with her chaining and clustering techniques, many of those tags suddenly identified not just a single address but an enormous cluster belonging to the same owner. With just a few hundred tags, she had put an identity to more than a million of Bitcoin\u2019s once-pseudonymous addresses.\nA chart from Meiklejohn\u2019s paper showing her \u201Cclustering\u201D of Bitcoin addresses for early cryptocurrency entities.\nCOURTESY OF SARAH MEIKLEJOHNWith just the 30 addresses she had identified by moving coins into and out of Mt. Gox, for instance, she could now link more than 500,000 addresses to the exchange. And based on just four deposits and seven withdrawals into wallets on the Silk Road, she was able to identify nearly 300,000 of the black market\u2019s addresses. This breakthrough didn\u2019t mean Meiklejohn could identify any actual users of the Silk Road by name, nor could she unmask, of course, the mysterious kingpin of that site, the ultra libertarian Dread Pirate Roberts. But it would directly contradict DPR\u2019s claims to me that his Bitcoin \u201Ctumbler\u201D system could prevent observers from even seeing when users moved cryptocurrency into and out of their Silk Road accounts.\nWhen Meiklejohn brought her results back to Savage, her adviser was impressed. But as they began to plan to publish a paper on her findings, he wanted a concrete demonstration for readers, not a bunch of arcane statistics. \u201CWe need to show people,\u201D Meiklejohn remembers him saying, \u201Cwhat these techniques can actually do.\u201D\nSo Meiklejohn went a step further: She began to look for specific bitcoin transactions she could track\u2014particularly criminal ones.\nAS MEIKLEJOHN HAD trawled cryptocurrency forums for discussions of interesting addresses worth scrutinizing, one mysterious mountain of money in particular stood out: This single address had, over the course of 2012, accumulated 613,326 bitcoins\u20145 percent of all the coins in circulation. It represented around $7.5 million at the time, a figure nowhere near the billions it would represent today, but a heady sum nonetheless. Rumors among Bitcoin users suggested that the hoard was possibly a Silk Road wallet, or perhaps the result of an unrelated, notorious Bitcoin Ponzi scheme carried out by a user known as pirate@40.\nMeiklejohn couldn\u2019t say which of the two rumors might be correct. But with her clustering techniques, she could now follow that giant sum of cryptocurrency. She saw that after conspicuously gathering at one address, the pile of money had been broken up in late 2012 and sent on forking paths around the blockchain. Meiklejohn\u2019s understanding of peel chains meant she could now trace those sums of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as they split, distinguishing the amount that remained in the control of the initial owner from the smaller sums that were peeled off in subsequent payments. Eventually, several of those peel chains led to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp, where they seemed to be cashed out for traditional currency. For an academic researcher, this was a dead end. But anyone with the subpoena power of law enforcement, Meiklejohn realized, could very likely force those exchanges to hand over information about the accounts behind those transactions and solve the mystery of the $7.5 million stash.\nFar from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\nLooking for more coins to hunt, Meiklejohn turned her focus to another sort of dirty money. Large-scale cryptocurrency heists were, in early 2013, a growing epidemic. After all, bitcoin was like cash or gold. Anyone who stole a Bitcoin address\u2019s secret key could empty out that address like a digital safe. Unlike with credit cards or other digital payment systems, there was no overseer who could stop or reverse the money\u2019s movement. That had made every bitcoin business and its stash of crypto revenue a ripe target for hackers, especially if the holders of those funds made the mistake of storing their secret keys on internet-connected computers\u2014the equivalent of carrying six- or seven-figure sums of cash in their pockets while strolling through a dangerous neighborhood.\nMeiklejohn found a thread on Bitcointalk that listed addresses of many of the biggest, most conspicuous crypto thefts in recent memory, and she began to follow the money. Looking at a robbery of 3,171 coins from an early bitcoin gambling site, she immediately found she could trace the stolen funds across no fewer than ten hops, from address to address, before different branches of the money were cashed out at exchanges. Another theft of 18,500 bitcoins from the exchange Bitcoinica similarly led her along a winding series of peel chains that ended at three other exchanges, where the robbers were no doubt cashing in their ill-gotten gains. Sitting in front of Meiklejohn, on her screen, was a bonanza of leads, each just waiting for any actual criminal investigator with a handful of subpoenas to follow them.Now, when Meiklejohn showed Savage her results, he agreed: They were ready to publish.\nIn the final draft of the paper Meiklejohn and her coauthors put together, they definitively stated conclusions\u2014based for the first time on solid, empirical evidence\u2014that flew in the face of what many Bitcoin users believed at the time: Far from being untraceable, they wrote, the blockchain was an open book that could identify vast swaths of transactions between people, many of whom thought they were acting anonymously.\n\u201CEven our relatively small experiment demonstrates that this approach can shed considerable light on the structure of the Bitcoin economy, how it is used, and those organizations who are party to it,\u201D the paper read. \u201CWe demonstrate that an agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the public nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary flows to major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.\u201D\nHaving set down those words, and blowing a gaping hole in the myth of Bitcoin\u2019s inherent untraceability, Meiklejohn, Savage, and her other adviser Geoffrey Voelker started brainstorming a clever title. In an homage to the Wild West of the economy they were chronicling\u2014and her advisers\u2019 mutual love of spaghetti Westerns\u2014they started with the phrase \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins,\u201D an allusion to the 1960s Clint Eastwood classic A Fistful of Dollars. They settled on a subtitle that evoked both Eastwood\u2019s most famous cowboy vigilante and the world of shadowy figures their nascent techniques could unmask. When the UCSD paper hit the internet in August 2013, it was introduced with a description that, to those involved, had come to seem inevitable: \u201CA Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names.\u201D\nIn the new era of cryptocurrency tracing that would follow Meiklejohn\u2019s work, they wouldn\u2019t remain nameless for long.\nAdapted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency.

From Backpack to OPNX, faces new and old are vying to fill it.","post_content":"The fall of FTX created a \u201Chuge vacuum\u201D in the cryptocurrency market, says Can Sun, cofounder of Backpack, a new crypto exchange under development in the United Arab Emirates. Sun knows that better than most: He was previously the general counsel at FTX, whose high-profile collapse has led to industry-wide turmoil this year. Backpack is one of the parties racing to fill the hole FTX left behind. It\u2019s a \u201Cwinner-takes-all\u201D opportunity, Sun says.\nSun has partnered with Armani Ferrante, previously a software engineer at Alameda Research, the sibling company through which FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried ran billions of dollars that weren\u2019t his before spending them. Their front-row perspective of the FTX debacle, the duo say, could help give Backpack a competitive advantage.\nThe rise and rapid fall of FTX \u201Ctaught us a number of lessons,\u201D says Sun. The biggest? The precarious art of balancing the need to reel in customers with a deep range of trading options, including riskier trades involving borrowed money, with the regulatory compliance necessary to ensure their funds remain protected.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n The ambition is for Backpack to serve customers outside the United States, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice have filed a raft of charges against crypto businesses. Crypto firms elsewhere face a less hostile reception. It will provide a similar selection of trades as FTX did, says Sun, but under a regulatory regime in Dubai, whose crypto-specific rules\u2014including daily checks for accounting aberrations\u2014are meant to prevent customer funds from being siphoned away.\nThere are only a \u201Cfew teams in the world\u201D capable of threading the needle correctly, claims Sun. Embroiled as they are in legal battles with regulators, many of the large incumbent exchanges, he says, are not well placed to \u201Ctake over the FTX mantle.\u201D The trick will be in beating the competition to the punch.\nIt took just three years for Bankman-Fried to turn FTX into a $32 billion company with millions of customers across the globe. It fell to pieces over the course of little more than a week.The fall of FTX was a watershed moment, whose knock-on effects\u2014including a market slump, a crypto banking crisis, regulatory backlash, and further bankruptcies\u2014have weighed heavily on the industry. In November 2023, in a court in New York, Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. He awaits sentencing.\nFTX demonstrated what can go wrong when a crypto exchange is given the latitude to operate in an opaque fashion and with minimal external oversight. It changed what is now expected of other exchanges, too.\nWithin a week of FTX\u2019s collapse, Binance, the world\u2019s largest exchange, had proposed a new minimum standard. In a blog post published on November 15, 2022, Changpeng Zhao, then Binance CEO, set out a series of best practices for exchanges that boiled down to: Don\u2019t gamble, don\u2019t borrow, and don\u2019t cheat. Zhao said that Binance would begin to publish a transparent \u201Cproof of reserves,\u201D a kind of internal audit that would demonstrate the exchange kept enough in its coffers to meet withdrawals. A number of its peers, from Bitfinex and Crypto.com to Huobi and OKX, followed suit.\nIt was a start, but an imperfect one: Proofs of reserves provide only a snapshot of assets at a particular moment in time, not a real-time picture, creating room for numbers to be fudged. They also don\u2019t illustrate an exchange\u2019s liabilities, so they provide only a partial indication of financial health.\nThere are a lot of exchanges even with FTX out of the picture, says venture investor William Quigley, who also cofounded the Tether stablecoin. But there is an opening, he says, for an exchange that can demonstrate it stores customer assets responsibly, protects against market manipulation, and follows rigorous compliance procedures. \u201CThat\u2019s an area ripe for improvement,\u201D Quigley says.\nNew players are pitching more technically elaborate methods of proving that customer funds have not been FTX-ed. Backpack is developing a new proof of reserves, updated automatically on a daily basis, explains Ferrante, whereby the availability of funds for withdrawal is demonstrated \u201Ccryptographically\u201D as opposed to through an opaque internal audit. To prevent funds from being quietly shifted about, the exchange will operate under a system whereby each crypto token transfer must be authorized by multiple parties. The aim is to ensure \u201Cthere is no single point of failure,\u201D says Ferrante, and the exchange has \u201Cmultiple levels of defense.\u201D\nOther competitors, like OPNX, an exchange launched in April by Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, the cofounders of bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, are trying to scoop up former FTX customers with a different approach. OPNX provides regular crypto trading, but also lets customers trade their bankruptcy claims. Instead of waiting out a lengthy bankruptcy process, someone with money locked up on FTX could choose to sell off their claim for a certain number of cents on the dollar, swapping maximum recovery potential for immediate access to funds.\nOPNX declined a request for an interview, but speaking to WIRED in March, CEO Leslie Lamb said she hoped to \u201Cgive people a path to get back into crypto if they choose\u201D and tap into an \u201Cincredibly underserved market\u201D: traders whose assets are stranded in bankruptcy proceedings.Backpack has signed tens of thousands of prospective customers to a waitlist, claim Sun and Ferrante, but the exchange will not go live until the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, OPNX has struggled to muscle its way into the market in its first six months in operation: In October, the firm announced it had serviced $10 billion in total trades, a volume FTX racked up in just a few days at its peak.\nIncumbents like Binance have also struggled to capture FTX\u2019s corner of the market. In the months after FTX fell, Binance\u2019s market share rose as high as 66 percent. Data shared with WIRED by blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows that even now, the exchange consistently attracts the highest total value of crypto deposits. After US regulators filed lawsuits against the firm in the summer, though, with rumors of criminal charges to follow, customers retreated from Binance.\nAfter reaching a settlement with the Department of Justice in November, in which Binance pleaded guilty to historical money-laundering and sanctions violations, the exchange is hoping to turn over a new leaf\u2014and in particular, to attract new high-value institutional investors. However, the firm acknowledges there is work to be done from a reputational standpoint. \u201CIt is difficult for [institutional investors] to work with businesses and exchanges that have question marks over their compliance status,\u201D says Catherine Chen, a Binance executive tasked with attracting high-value customers. \u201CWe know that removing concerns about illicit finance in crypto is one of the most important things we need to drive mainstream adoption and more institutional investment.\u201D\nThere\u2019s another argument that the most suitable replacement for FTX could, somewhat curiously, be FTX itself. In April, a campaign began among a group of FTX creditors\u2014the FTX 2.0 Coalition\u2014who sought to convince those in charge of the bankruptcy estate to consider rebooting the exchange.\nThe idea is for FTX to be auctioned off to bidders willing to restart it and to swap creditors\u2019 debt for equity in the new venture. If the new FTX succeeded thereafter, the value of each creditor\u2019s equity might some day exceed the amount they originally lost, creating an incentive for those people to trade on the platform.\nThe inertia of the bankruptcy court means a reboot effort is unlikely to progress swiftly, says Pat Rabbitte, one of the leaders of the FTX 2.0 Coalition, but the built-in customer base will help to compensate for the delay. \u201CIn crypto, the customer churn rate is really high and customer acquisition is really expensive,\u201D says Rabbitte. \u201CBut here is a unique opportunity.\u201D\nFTX did not respond to a request for interview, but the administrators of the bankruptcy estate are reportedly fielding proposals from three bidders willing to restart the exchange.\nThe difficulty facing the pretenders to the FTX throne lies in establishing trust among crypto investors. After 18 months of turbulence and high-profile litigation involving some of the largest crypto firms, in which consumers have lost billions of dollars in aggregate, \u201Cthere\u2019s no faith in the industry anymore,\u201D says Sun. \u201CPeople think this is a scam.\u201D\nNewcomers like Backpack are proposing a techno-regulatory solution to dodge around that trust issue. In effect, they\u2019re arguing that customers don\u2019t need to trust the companies or their founders because the technology proves that assets are not being misused and regulators are keeping watch. With FTX 2.0, the idea is that everyone whose fingerprints might be found on a damaging crypto collapse be \u201Ctaken out of the equation entirely,\u201D says Rabbitte.\nThere is a feeling at Backpack that the window of opportunity is closing rapidly, as more stringent regulatory restrictions imposed on crypto businesses increase the cost of entry. \u201CIt\u2019s going to become harder and harder [to launch new exchanges] as time goes on,\u201D says Ferrante. The legacy of FTX\u2014that exchanges will be held to higher standards\u2014will benefit investors, he argues, but make it harder to build something from scratch. \u201CTime is of the essence,\u201D he says.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6580c28f88d7c228e2238f2b\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_ftx_crypto_exchange_market.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"The Race to Fill Crypto\u2019s FTX-Shaped Hole","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-new-crypto-exchanges-backpack\/","tags":["","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","YEAR IN REVIEW"]},{"date":"12.11.2023","summary":"The responsible AI, sustainable tech, and cleantech scenes are all thriving in Amsterdam, a city favored for its location, cost of living, and culture.","post_content":"IT\u2019S EASY TO see why global investment platform fDi Intelligence ranked Amsterdam a heavyweight for direct investment, maintaining its number two spot among major European cities.

It means that when the company is sentenced in a matter of months, it will be forced to open its past books to regulators, too. What was once a haven for anarchic crypto commerce is about to be transformed into the opposite: perhaps the most fed-friendly business in the cryptocurrency industry, retroactively offering more than a half-decade of users' transaction records to US regulators and law enforcement.\nWhen the Department of Justice announced on November 21 that Binance's executives had agreed to plead guilty to criminal money-laundering charges, much of the attention on that settlement focused on founder Changpeng Zhao giving up his CEO role and on the company's record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. But Binance's settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US Treasury Department also stipulate a strict new regime of data-sharing with law enforcement and regulators. The company has agreed to comply with regulators' \"requests for information\"\u2014a term that carries none of the evidence or suspicion requirements necessary for obtaining a warrant or even a subpoena\u2014to the point of producing any \"information, testimony, document, record, or other tangible evidence.\"\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nBinance has also agreed to scour all of its transactions from 2018 to 2022 and file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for anything it deems a potential violation of US law from that five-year period. That \u201CSAR lookback\u201D means the company will now be actively scrutinizing its customers in retrospect, not just passively assenting to regulators poring over its databases. Those SARs are collected by FinCEN, the Treasury Department's financial crimes division, but then made available to law enforcement agencies from the FBI to IRS Criminal Investigations to local police. And all of this new scrutiny will be overseen by a \"monitor\" firm chosen by the US government but paid by Binance\u2014an in-house watchdog assigned to make sure Binance is complying in good faith.\n\"I don't think Binance's customers have the slightest clue of the ramifications of this plea and consent decree. It's unprecedented,\" says John Reed Stark, who spent 20 years as an attorney at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including as the founder of its Office of Internet Enforcement. \u201CIf they're a drug dealer or a terrorist or a child pornography peddler, they're going to get caught.\" He describes Binance's agreement as a \"24\/7, 365-days-a-year financial colonoscopy.\"\nOne US prosecutor, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to media about the case, calls the degree of access to Binance's records described in the agreement \"kind of crazy,\" and remains in disbelief at the idea of Binance abiding by the settlement. \"I don't know what kind of business would want to operate while allowing that much government oversight, especially one that's deliberately stayed out of the US so that they're not under our nose,\" they say. \"The other option must have been really bad.\"If Binance does comply, however, the prosecutor adds that \"it would be a game changer in taking down transnational syndicates doing evil deeds worldwide and trying to shield those crimes by using cryptocurrency to move money.\"\nBinance's chief compliance officer, Noah Perlman, tells WIRED that Binance has collected \"know-your-customer\" information on users and cooperated with US law enforcement on data requests for the past two years. He added that all reports to the monitor firm inside Binance would be \"confidential\"\u2014as in, not shared publicly, only with the US government\u2014and that it would continue to abide by data privacy laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.\nBut Perlman also says he's \"excited\" for the new era the agreements represent for Binance. \"I feel like this is a great opportunity for Binance to set the standard for what compliance in this industry should look like,\" he says. \"For the general community, removing concerns of illicit finance in crypto is one of the most important things we can do to drive mainstream adoption. Hopefully, the vast majority of users will feel that there's assurance here, that the funds are safer than ever, and they have nothing to worry about as long as they're not part of the very small, small group of users that use crypto for illicit purposes.\"\nWhile Binance's new radical transparency may be welcomed by law enforcement and regulators, its users and advocates of financial privacy may not be so pleased. Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein calls the settlement an \"overreach\" that he believes is part of a US regulatory effort to set a precedent for crypto as a whole. \u201CThey\u2019re going to try to force people to use these regulated platforms where everything is monitorable,\" Gladstein says. He adds that Binance is \"an unsavory corporation, but still, it's alarming what the US government is doing.\"\nDigital civil liberties nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation, too, has historically called on cryptocurrency exchanges to stop giving up users' transaction data to law enforcement and regulators without notifying those users. Now, the Binance settlement would create perhaps the most extreme case yet of that crypto exchange data-sharing, giving the US government wholesale access to the records of a crypto hub that at some points processed billions of transactions a day.\n\"EFF is increasingly worried about law enforcement turning to intermediaries such as cryptocurrency exchanges and hosted wallet providers to obtain sensitive user data,\" the EFF's cryptocurrency-focused attorney, Marta Belcher, wrote in a 2020 blog post. \"The fact that the transactions are made through cryptocurrency rather than through traditional financial channels indicates that the transactions are more likely to be sensitive, and that the person making the transaction may be turning to cryptocurrency precisely because of the privacy protection it provides.\" That argument may apply particularly to Binance, given its early reputation as an offshore exchange that didn't bow to US government data demands.\nIn fact, some Binance users may not have considered the risk of their data becoming available to crypto investigators in the new settlement, in part because Binance has at some points collected far less data on its users than other exchanges. Part of Binance's appeal to users has been that, for years, it asked only for a user's email address to set up an account\u2014one of its many now-admitted violations of US know-your-customer requirements that led to last month's crackdown.But US law enforcement has proven that even troves of exchange data that lack users' names can nonetheless be highly revealing of their financial history\u2014especially in combination with blockchain data and information from other exchanges that usually do comply with know-your-customer laws. In the case of the Welcome to Video child sexual abuse materials dark-web site in 2017, for instance, one alleged abuser was identified and arrested after his email address was tied to an account on the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e, which authorities had seized months earlier.\nIn another case, BTC-e's data allowed IRS criminal investigators to identify a hacker who had taken nearly 70,000 bitcoins from the Silk Road dark-web drug market\u2014worth more than $3 billion today\u2014and then track them down and seize the funds. Though BTC-e didn't collect users' names or other identifying details, its data still served as the missing link in both those cases\u2014just as Binance's no doubt will in many more investigations to come.\nAssenting to have US regulators comb through its data, for a company that spent years resisting regulation, may be a severe culture shock, says Stark, the former SEC attorney. He says he won't be surprised if the company ends up violating the terms of the agreement. \"It's like taking someone who's been a drug addict for a decade and drug-testing them every day and thinking that they're not going to try to sneak something in,\" he says.\nUltimately, with enormous fines and criminal sentences hanging over the heads of its executives\u2014and worse punishments if its settlement falls through\u2014Binance may not have a choice about baring its soul to the US government. Neither, whether they know it or not, will its users.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/655e55765a9f03a94854e2cd\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/binance.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"The Binance Crackdown Will Be an 'Unprecedented' Bonanza for Crypto Surveillance","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/binance-settlement-transaction-histories\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","PRIVACY","CRIME","POLICE","REGULATION"]},{"date":"11.27.2023","summary":"Looking to solve the problem of ethically sourced gems, Opsydia has developed tech to hide submicron-sized dots in precious stones.","post_content":"IF YOU\u2019VE EVER bought an engagement ring, or any other diamond jewelry, you likely know about the \u201CFour Cs\u201D: carat, cut, color, and clarity, which between them determine the quality of a gem. The unofficial fifth C is certification\u2014paperwork from an independent authority validating the qualities and authenticity of a stone. Now, however, a UK startup is aiming to bring yet another C into the mix: code.\nOpsydia, a company spun out in 2017 from research conducted at the University of Oxford, is pioneering the laser inscription of near-invisible identifier codes\u2014what it calls \u201Cnano-IDs\u201D\u2014inside diamonds.\nEach nano-ID consists of a series of submicron-size dots that are imprinted a fifth of a millimeter beneath the gem\u2019s surface, the dots forming a numerical code that\u2019s linked to official certification documents or (increasingly) blockchain ledgers.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nNeurologist Answers Nerve Questions From Twitter\nCrucially, such an identifier doesn\u2019t come close to registering as the kind of mark that would impact a stone\u2019s quality. Magnification of at least 200X and specifically designed illumination is needed just to spot these subsurface codes. For comparison, specialists in diamond grading laboratories work with between 40X and 80X magnification; a jeweler\u2019s loupe offers considerably less.\n\u201CBecause the dots are under 1 micron in all dimensions, it\u2019s actually incredibly difficult to characterize the kind of physical change that\u2019s there\u2014it\u2019s close to doing nothing at all,\u201D says Lewis Fish, Opsydia\u2019s head of product, pointing to a 5-mm diamond inscribed with a nano-ID. \u201CWe sent that for checking to one of the leading grading laboratories, and they knew the code was there\u2014but they couldn\u2019t find it.\u201D\nUsing lasers to inscribe tiny codes and even logos onto diamonds is not in itself new. Usually placed on the stone\u2019s girdle (a narrow band at the outer perimeter, dividing upper and lower sections), these have been on offer from grading labs and other providers since the 1980s. But the codes\u2019 surface positioning is also their weakness: They can be polished off. Also, once set in a piece of jewelry they may be obscured.\nThe proliferation of laser technology, meanwhile, means that bad actors can inscribe either fake codes\u2014for instance, assigning a serial number wrongly designating a higher quality of stone, or indeed labeling a lab-grown diamond as natural\u2014or counterfeit versions of the logos of official laboratories and institutions.\nDynamite With a Laser Beam\nEach Opsydia nano-ID consists of a series of submicron-sized dots imprinted a fifth of a millimeter beneath the gem\u2019s surface.\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nBy contrast, because Opsydia\u2019s technology\u2014which is packaged up in a piano-size machine supplied to industry players such as jewelry brands, manufacturers, and grading labs at a cost of £400,000 ($524,000)\u2014places the inscription beneath the surface, it is supposedly out of reach of the scammers.The code-writing laser beam itself is focused to extreme precision, using patented technology that Opsydia says is unique worldwide in its capabilities. That means it can overcome the exceptionally high refractive index of diamond: The beam effectively behaves as though the diamond, which would normally send a light wave flying off in myriad directions, isn\u2019t there at all.\nWith laser pulses lasting less than a trillionth of a second, there\u2019s apparently no heat damage. And the near invisibility of the mark means that rather than being hidden in a discreet part of the diamond, it can sit centrally, right under the top of the stone.\n\u201CIf you wanted to remove it, you\u2019d have to recut the stone and lose a huge amount of the value,\u201D says Andrew Rimmer, Opsydia\u2019s CEO. That\u2019s because reducing the top of a diamond, even by the shallow amount needed to cut out the nano-ID, would generally require recutting other facets to maintain proportionality.\nAnd while the firm trains its customers\u2019 technicians to use its machines and program in the codes themselves, any logos or other IP can only be uploaded by Opsydia itself. \u201CSoftware encryption means we control that,\u201D says Rimmer. \u201CWe\u2019ve set out right from the beginning to have a secure solution.\u201D\nTransparency and traceability have become especially hot topics in the jewelry industry and the wider luxury sector, as demand for goods that are ethically sourced and verifiable has increased sharply. \u201CIssues at the turn of the century such as blood diamonds and conflict gold created awareness that greater transparency was needed in diamond and gem supply chains,\u201D says Laurent Cartier, head of special initiatives at the Swiss Gemmological Institute and a lecturer at the University of Lausanne.\n\u201CToday the main drivers are regulations from governments, the banking sector, and OECD guidelines, and the growing demands of consumers to know more about where and how the gems in their jewelry were sourced.\u201D\nTo that end, technological solutions that can help analyze, verify, and identify diamonds and gemstones are being increasingly explored. Earlier this year, for instance, the Swiss company Spacecode announced a device it says can chemically analyze the makeup of a particular diamond and identify its place of origin, while others are also investigating the notion that each diamond has a unique chemical and morphological \u201Cfingerprint\u201D that can identify it.\nCartier warns against assumptions that technology alone can solve all such issues, \u201Cbut it is a very important part of the traceability puzzle,\u201D he says. Opsydia\u2019s subsurface tech, he says, \u201Cadds an extra layer of security and is a promising approach for high-value diamonds and gemstones.\u201D\nIn particular, Rimmer says Opsydia\u2019s nano-IDs can bring added certainty to the kinds of blockchain platforms that have emerged in recent years to support traceability and authentication in the luxury and jewelry sectors. Examples include the Aura platform developed with Microsoft by LVMH, Cartier, and Prada, and Tracr, launched by the world\u2019s largest diamond producer, De Beers.\nHowever, as Cartier points out, such platforms are only as good as the quality of the data going into them: Knowing the origin of a diamond only tells you so much. \u201CThere may be a paper trail and audits that confirm it comes from a specific mine and a particular set of standards were followed,\u201D he says. \u201CTechnology can be useful in carrying that information all the way through the supply chain in transparent and verifiable ways.\u201D But a paper trail could be assigned to the wrong gem.That, says Rimmer, is where Opsydia comes in. \u201CBlockchain is a way of storing information securely, but you need to make sure it\u2019s linked to the physical stone or piece of jewelry.\u201D So as well as inscribing a serial number that goes into the blockchain, Opsydia\u2019s machines can take a photograph of the inscription that can also be stored in the ledger. As another safeguard, the company has developed a light-box viewing system to demonstrate the inscription in jewelry showrooms.\nRimmer adds that a single Opsydia machine can process around 100,000 stones a year (each one takes around 10 seconds). He\u2019s targeting both profitability for Opsydia, which closed its third funding round last summer, and the processing of 10 million stones annually across the company\u2019s machines, by 2025.\nShaping Space Lasers\nEach Opsydia machine can process around 100,000 stones a year (each one takes around 10 seconds).\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nBut it wasn\u2019t out of a wish to solve diamond traceability that Opsydia\u2019s technology was developed. Rather, it emerged as part of wider research into areas including adaptive optics for space telescopes and the precise shaping of laser beams, conducted at Oxford University\u2019s Department for Engineering Science.\nOpsydia was set up in 2017 through Oxford University Innovation, the company that manages IP licensing and spin-offs from the institution\u2019s research work, to commercialize the research team\u2019s technology. The first laser machines were delivered in 2020, with De Beers\u2019 lab diamond arm, Lightbox Jewelery, among the early takers. As well as diamonds, the laser inscriptions can also be applied to any gemstone.\n\u201CWhen we started, there were a few conversations ongoing around traceability, but now it is the number one conversation in the jewelry industry,\u201D says Rimmer. \u201CSo the real pull is coming from the brands who want to be able to tell this story as part of their promise to consumers, because that\u2019s what they\u2019re asking for.\u201D\nThe war in Ukraine and consequent difficulties in stemming the flow of diamonds from Russia, among the world\u2019s largest producers, into Western markets, have served to highlight the complexity and opaqueness of gemstone supply chains globally, and the need for new ways to tackle this.Opsydia\u2019s technology can only be applied at the stage of a stone being polished and cut, though the company is \u201Clooking at the feasibility of doing something at the \u2018rough\u2019 stage,\u201D says Rimmer, suggesting that raw, uncut diamonds could one day be laser-inscribed at source. That, however, is apparently some way off. \u201CWe\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re investigating,\u201D he says.\nQuantum Leap\nThe laser tech has potential to create atomic-scale defects in the diamond lattice where two carbon atoms are replaced by a nitrogen atom and an empty space. Such chambers have remarkable quantum properties.\nPHOTOGRAPH: OPSYDIA\nAway from the glittering world of gemstones, Opsydia\u2019s advances in applying precisely controlled lasers to diamond structures are also presenting opportunities in new industrial fields. \u201CWe\u2019re able to write electrical circuits inside a diamond wafer,\u201D says Rimmer. This brings into play the emerging world of diamond-based electronic devices, with multiple potential applications\u2014including perhaps the greatest prize: quantum computing.\nIn essence, the laser can be tuned to transform localized parts of a diamond's carbon lattice (the arrangement of atoms in a diamond crystal) into graphitic structures that conduct electricity\u2014micro-scale, 3D electronic circuits. Such devices are used in particle accelerators at CERN, for instance, in high-energy particle detection applications where other materials degrade quickly.\nRimmer says there are other potential uses in electrochemistry, instrumentation, and radiation detection. \u201CThe big benefit that diamond has over silicon and other materials is that it\u2019s not damaged by radiation.\u201D\nBut there may be even greater potential in using the laser to create nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in the diamond lattice: invisible, atomic-scale defects where two carbon atoms are replaced by a nitrogen atom and an empty space.\nNV centers have remarkable quantum properties, including ultra-sensitive magnetic field detection and the ability to emit and manipulate light at the single photon level. That makes them effective as controllable and measurable quantum systems.\n\u201CAn NV center can operate as a qubit, which means that diamond is one of the candidate materials for quantum processing,\u201D says Rimmer. While that\u2019s the end goal, nearer-term applications around ultra-fine magnetic sensing and instrumentation\u2014for magnetic ground surveys, for instance, or GPS communication\u2014are also in play.\nAll of that remains at the university research stage for now. Nevertheless, for Opsydia\u2019s investors, diamond traceability may just be the tip of a very sparkly iceberg.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6560e5b999ddb42710bfd1b6\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/WIRED-Online-Opsydia-1.jpg","author":"BY TIM BARBER","title":"This Laser Can Help Verify the Source of a Diamond","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/opsydia-hide-secret-codes-in-diamonds-space-lasers\/","tags":["","QUANTUM COMPUTING","LUXURY"]},{"date":"11.22.2023","summary":"A self-described Ethereum pioneer says he\u2019s suing his former colleagues over the origins of a piece of crypto infrastructure\u2014and to show how \u201Crotten\u201D the industry has become.","post_content":"JOEL DIETZ SAYS crypto is rotten, and he\u2019s going to court to try to prove it.

Its success has seen it pick up a less welcome feature of social platforms: a black market in fake engagement.\nAn ecosystem of online stores and chat groups openly sell GitHub stars, which users award to signal interest in a project and can be tallied to rank the most popular. For the bargain price of $6 paid in ether, the crypto token of the Ethereum blockchain, WIRED bought 50 stars for a dormant GitHub project via the straightforwardly branded site BuyGithub.com. The fake endorsements appeared in just hours.\nThe shady stars for sale are part of a wider black market in online engagement metrics used by coders, investors, and others in tech to highlight promising programmers and startups when deciding who to hire, work for, or invest in.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nStanford Computer Scientist Answers Coding Questions From Twitter\nOnline stores also offer upvotes for projects listed on Product Hunt, the community platform that promises to help individuals discover the next big thing in tech before everyone else, and followers and views on data science community Kaggle, where standing out can lead to job offers. The vendors appear to be aiming to tap into the ambition and perhaps desperation of people looking for a shortcut to success in an industry sometimes associated with the mantra \u201Cfake it till you make it.\u201D\n\u201CAlmost all online manipulation is some form of hijacking attention for the purpose of making money\u2014acquiring attention and then transforming that into money or power,\u201D says Filippo Menczer, director of Indiana University\u2019s Observatory on Social Media. \u201CGitHub is no different. It\u2019s a market of attention because there are mechanisms by which people acquire notoriety and influence and reputation through how popular or how widely used their software is.\u201D\nInto the Bot-iverse\nFraser Marlow, head of growth for data orchestration startup Dagster, stumbled into the market for gaming GitHub last year after noticing that investors seemed to use stars on the platform as a signal that an open source offering had traction.\nHis team bought stars from two different online stores and used data gathered in the process to build a model to detect fake stars in GitHub repositories. They ran the model on Dagster\u2019s own code repository as well as several others.\nCryptocurrency project Okcash was the worst offender: 97 percent of its 759 stars were flagged as fake by Dagster\u2019s detector. Meanwhile only 1.6 percent of 29,435 stars were flagged as fake for Apache Airflow, an open source project that competes with Dagster. The analysis was limited to stars gained from 2022 onwards; Astronomer, the leading contributor to the Apache Airflow community, declined to comment.Okcash\u2019s founder, Oktoshi San, says that his project does not care about vanity metrics\u2014such as stars and forks\u2014but that some community members have launched giveaways inviting people to star the project on GitHub in return for Okcash tokens.\nDagster\u2019s findings built on earlier work, including a paper by academic researchers who identified over 63,000 accounts suspected of awarding suspect stars active on GitHub between 2015 to 2019. The findings were arrived at by analyzing data from star sellers on messaging app Telegram and Chinese messaging platforms WeChat and QQ.\n\u201CGitHub Security has been aware of the presence of fake starrers for years, and actively works to remove these from the platform,\u201D says Jesse Geraci, the company\u2019s online safety counsel. Geraci acknowledges it can be challenging to strike a balance between accurately removing inauthentic accounts while permitting genuine ones to operate unimpeded. \u201CSixty-three thousand suspected accounts may sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a very small percentage of the more than 100 million developers building on GitHub,\u201D Geraci says.\nAfter Marlow\u2019s blog post on his work tracking suspect stars, almost all the stars he paid for disappeared within a week. The stars WIRED purchased were also removed less than a month after purchasing. GitHub's anti-abuse team combines manual investigation with software techniques to identify inauthentic accounts.\n\u201CThe obsession around GitHub stars I like to think was a bit of a hangover from the ZIRP bubble,\u201D says Marlow, referring to the zero interest-rate policy that recently ended in the US. It\u2019s inside baseball\u2014something only VCs and firms obsess about, he says\u2014but over the past year he\u2019s already noticed people are putting less weight on them.\nVenture investors are \u201Chardwired\u201D to look for fast growth in startups seeking investment, says Pratima Aiyagari, a partner at venture firm Nauta Capital. Open source projects can operate for years without generating significant revenue, she says, so investors look for other growth signals, of which GitHub stars are just one. The success of companies like business software firm Mulesoft and collaborative software development platform Gitlab has drawn strong interest into open source companies, she says. \u201CVC money has been pouring into the space.\u201D\nTo track open source startups, venture firm Runa Capital created the ROSS Index, which ranks companies by annualized growth rate of GitHub stars. It has become a widely followed benchmark for fast-growing open source products.\nThe index is a good predictor of whether a company will raise a round, says Konstantin Vinogradov, a general partner at Runa. Around a third of all the companies listed in the index since its launch in 2020 have raised subsequent rounds within the next 12 months, he says.\nOver time, metrics can invalidate themselves, says Stuart Geiger, an assistant professor at UC San Diego. He says two \u201Claws\u201D attributed to social scientists sum up why: The more a metric is used in decisionmaking, the more it will be manipulated (Campbell\u2019s law), and a metric that becomes a target ceases to be useful (Goodhart\u2019s law).The line between smart strategy and cheating can be blurry. \u201CIf a company becomes number one on Product Hunt, they put it on their website, then maybe it will increase their conversion rate for customers,\u201D says Vinogradov. \u201CIs it just winning the game? Or is it a business-driven, reasonable strategy?\u201D\nKevin Zhang, a former venture investor now building his own startup, says GitHub stars have seemed to become a target for entrepreneurs looking to impress. \u201CI started noticing that founders were putting more star growth on their decks,\u201D he says. \u201CThat always gives you a little bit of suspicion right? Oh, maybe it\u2019s a little bit gamed.\u201D\nBut Zhang and other investors say that while gaming a metric like stars might help a startup get a first meeting with VCs, it\u2019s unlikely to get them a second. Investor perspectives on GitHub metrics have changed in recent years as a result of gamification and an increased understanding of the open source market, Zhang says. Good GitHub engagement is one promising signal, but it's not a bulletproof sign of success, Zhang, Vinogradov, and Aiyagari all say, with information on the founding team, market, and many other data points all considered before making an investment.\nCryptocurrency Preferred\nBaddhi Shop, an online store offering inauthentic metrics, rolled out its GitHub services earlier this year. It also sells Product Hunt upvotes, as well as upvotes, followers, and views on Kaggle. When WIRED sent messages to the LinkedIn account of the site\u2019s founder, Naga Durgarao Baddhi, responses came back claiming the business was aboveboard.\nWhen an order comes in for GitHub stars or another metric, a team of 11 get clicking, \u201Cfrom different cloud devices,\u201D Baddhi said, adding that this wasn\u2019t spam because the shop respects each website's terms of service. GitHub is not the most popular metric-cheating offering, Baddhi added. Discord, a chat room service popular with crypto projects, gets daily purchases, and metrics for 10 other services are also popular, Baddhi says. Kellyn Slone, a spokesperson for Discord, says creating or selling fake accounts violates its terms of service, and it takes action in response, including removing users from the service.\nSelling fake engagement is best known on leading social platforms such as Facebook. The emergence of a market for smaller, newer sites such as GitHub and Product Hunt could be due to mainstream platforms paying more attention to fake accounts, says Stefano Cresci, a researcher focused on disinformation, fake news, and social bots at the Institute of Informatics and Telematics, part of the National Research Council, in Pisa, Italy. Vendors may be moving to other platforms where it\u2019s easier to stay in business, he says.\nThere\u2019s also evidence that, now that life online is central to just about every area of human endeavor, online cheating occurs in even niche communities. Justin Hollander, a professor at Tufts University, near Boston, recently published research showing Twitter bots being used to try to influence urban planning. Bots were active across 21 US real estate projects, including the development of SoFi Stadium in California and mixed-use projects in Atlanta.\u201CA range of different community organizations and government agencies were using bots,\u201D he says. \u201CWe were not able to find just one group. It seems like any entity that\u2019s savvy and active in this space of shaping the city and being involved in these policy areas, they\u2019re using bots.\u201D\nMenczer of Indiana University likens the widespread use of social bots and fake engagement to the effects of pollution, with junk piling up to bury what has value and quality. He expects it to get worse as technology advances. Menczer and colleagues recently found evidence of a cryptocurrency-pushing bot network on Twitter powered by ChatGPT.\n\u201CIt's hard for humans and hard for software to detect fake accounts,\u201D Menczer says. \u201CAnd ChatGPT will happily create lots of fake accounts for you that are impossible to distinguish from real ones.\u201D AI image generators are being used to generate realistic and unique fake profile pictures, says Menczer, eliminating what in the past was often a telltale way to identify fake accounts.\n\u201CIt\u2019s an arms race because social bots become smarter and smarter, more sophisticated,\u201D Menczer says. Whatever new engagement metrics emerge for software projects, companies, or people, the scammers won\u2019t be far behind.\nUpdated 10-23-2023, 3:15 pm EDT: Astronomer is the leading contributor to the Apache Airflow community, not its manager.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY KARI MCMAHON","title":"The GitHub Black Market That Helps Coders Cheat the Popularity Contest","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/github-stars-black-market-coders-cheat\/","tags":["","MACHINE LEARNING","SOCIAL","GITHUB","BOTS","STARTUPS","SOCIAL MEDIA","DEVELOPERS","PROGRAMMING"]},{"date":"10.19.2023","summary":"With a new emphasis on the Hamas attacks on Israel, the US Treasury has proposed designating foreign cryptocurrency \u201Cmixer\u201D services as money launderers and national security threats.","post_content":"HAMAS\u2019 ATTACKS AGAINST Israel on October 7 have shifted the geopolitical landscape and triggered a looming Israeli ground assault in the Gaza Strip. Now the ripple effects are reaching the cryptocurrency industry, where they\u2019ve become the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s rallying cry for a crackdown on cryptocurrency anonymity services.\nThe US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today released a set of proposed rules that would designate foreign cryptocurrency \u201Cmixers\u201D\u2014services that blend users\u2019 digital funds to offer more anonymity and make them harder to trace\u2014as money laundering tools that pose a threat to national security and would thus face new sanctions and regulations. The new rules, if adopted following a 90-day period of public comment and debate, would potentially represent the broadest restrictions imposed yet on the mixing services and could make it far harder for cryptocurrency holders to put their money through the services before cashing it out at a US cryptocurrency exchange, or even at a foreign exchange that accepts US customers.\nWhile the proposed rules were almost certainly in the works long before October 7, the Treasury\u2019s announcement tied the push for a change in policy directly to the use of cryptocurrency by Hamas and militant groups in Gaza. \u201CThe Treasury Department is aggressively combatting illicit use of all aspects of the CVC ecosystem by terrorist groups,\u201D Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury, wrote in a statement, using the term \u201CCVC\u201D to mean convertible virtual currency. Adeyemo says that this includes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group that often aligns with Hamas, which Israel blamed for an explosion at a hospital in Gaza earlier this week.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nCryptocurrency mixers have existed almost as long as Bitcoin itself. They offer to take in a user\u2019s cryptocurrency, blend it with that of other users, and return the funds so that they are harder to follow from their origin to destination on blockchains, which generally record every transaction in full public view. The Treasury\u2019s rule change would designate those cryptocurrency-mixing services\u2014or at least the majority of them that are based outside the US\u2014as a \u201Cprimary money laundering concern.\u201D They would thus be considered a threat to US national security as defined by section 311 of the Patriot Act, a section of the law designed to restrict how domestic financial institutions interact with potential sources of terrorist financing.\nThe rule change would mean that US financial services, as well foreign ones with US customers\u2014including cryptocurrency exchanges\u2014would have to go through extra record-keeping and reporting requirements for funds that have touched a foreign cryptocurrency mixer, and it might even allow the Treasury to block US exchanges from handling those funds. \u201CWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201D says Ari Redbord, the head of global policy for TRM Labs, a blockchain analysis firm. Redbord notes that the rule change isn\u2019t proposing a blanket ban on foreign mixing services, only new rules for interacting with them. \u201CThe reality, however, is that 311 actions oftentimes have a sort of name-and-shame effect, where people are just not wanting to engage with these platforms out of fear of being caught up in money laundering or other type of illicit activity.\u201D\nRedbord, who previously served as an advisor to the Treasury\u2019s undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, also notes that the proposal was no doubt being considered prior to the latest Hamas attacks and that the Treasury must have changed the proposal\u2019s focus from the use of cryptocurrency by other national security threats, like North Korea and Russia, to Hamas and militant groups in recent days. \u201CHaving been at Treasury for a number of years, you don\u2019t just roll out an action like this over the course of 10 days,\u201D says Redbord. \u201CThey\u2019ve kind of shifted the narrative toward Hamas because that\u2019s the news.\u201DHamas and militant groups\u2019 use of cryptocurrency, while significant, pales in comparison to the amount of cryptocurrency used by other illicit actors. Hamas, for instance, raised $41 million in cryptocurrency over the past two years, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad raised $91 million, according to a report last week in the Wall Street Journal that cited analyses by cryptocurrency tracing firms and seizures by the Israeli government.\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, how much of those funds actually made it to these groups before being seized. In fact, Hamas asked its donors to stop using cryptocurrency in April of 2023, due to the public nature of the transactions on blockchains and the risk of prosecution. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis, which frequently works with government and law enforcement customers, went so far as to publish a blog post yesterday cautioning against mistaken analyses that overestimate the role of cryptocurrency in financing entities like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nNorth Korean state-sponsored cybercriminals, Russian ransomware gangs, and other criminal groups, by contrast, have pocketed billions of dollars through their theft of cryptocurrency or use of the technology as a means of demanding extortion payments from victims. Thieves stole $3.8 billion in crypto last year\u2014much of which went to the North Korean regime\u2014and ransomware hackers extorted close to $450 million in just the first half of 2023, according to Chainalysis.\nThose criminals often use cryptocurrency mixing services, funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into services like ChipMixer and Sinbad.io. In fact, US law enforcement and the Treasury Department have aggressively sanctioned or shut down one mixer service after another in recent years, including Blender, TornadoCash, and Bitzlato, often citing their use in laundering the profits of those North Korean and Russian hackers.\nThe new FinCEN rules would be less severe than those sanctions, indictments, and busts\u2014a new regulatory process rather than a ban\u2014but also far wider in scope, says Jason Somensatto, Chainalysis\u2019 head of North America public policy. \u201CThe impact can be much broader,\u201D says Somensatto. \u201CThey can say that this applies to all mixing services that people are interacting with.\u201D\nAs the Treasury doubles down on its push to cut off crypto-based money laundering\u2014and now points to Hamas as a new impetus for that crackdown\u2014TRM Labs\u2019 Redbord cautions that US regulators shouldn\u2019t go too far in censuring services that do, in some cases, offer financial privacy to legitimate users. After all, without mixers, most cryptocurrency transactions are fully public in nature. \u201CI think the challenge for regulators is, how do we thread the needle between stopping illicit actors from using these platforms but at the same time allow regular users to enable some degree of privacy?\u201D Redbord says. \u201CI think the concern is that this could very much be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Citing Hamas, the US Wants to Treat Crypto Anonymity Services as Suspected Money Launderers","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/us-treasury-crypto-mixer-hamas\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","ISRAEL","ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR"]},{"date":"10.18.2023","summary":"From online voting to frictionless taxes, Estonia\u2019s government services can sound like sci-fi to outsiders.

Nope, I hated that.\n[Laughter]\nLauren Goode: Three, two, one. Hi, I'm Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And I'm Gideon Lichfield. And this is Have a Nice Future, a podcast about how terrifyingly fast everything is changing.\nLauren Goode: Each week we talk to someone with big, audacious, and sometimes unnerving ideas about the future, and we ask them how we can all prepare to live in it.\nGideon Lichfield: Our guest this week is Luukas Ilves. He is the chief information officer of the government of Estonia, which people often talk about as one of the most digitally advanced governments in the world.\nLuukas Ilves (audio clip): The fact that other countries in a couple of years time can look at what we've done, learn these lessons, and then kind of catapult themselves into being the same league with us, that gives me ground for optimism that actually governments can get better at this.Lauren Goode: So Gideon, I've heard passing references to Estonia as this magical, futuristic place where everything runs on the blockchain or something. But I have to confess, I know very little about Estonia. I am going to be the proxy today for audience members listening to this who are like, \u201CI know nothing about Estonia, tell me.\u201D\nGideon Lichfield: That is your job.\nLauren Goode: That's my job.\n[Chuckle]\nGideon Lichfield: OK, well, so let me ask you something. In the last five years or so, how many times do you think you have filled in exactly the same information: your name, address, phone, email, social security number, health conditions, whatever, every single time you've gone to see a new doctor or applied for a driver's license, or done pretty much any other bit of bureaucracy?\nLauren Goode: A lot. A hundred. You're saying within the past year? I can't even begin to count.\nGideon Lichfield: Or five \u2026 However long. Yes.\nLauren Goode: I can't begin to remember. That's actually just called adulting.\nGideon Lichfield: That's why it's so hard.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nGideon Lichfield: So what if you never had to do that again? You show up at a new doctor's office or at City Hall or at the bank, and you just prove to them that you are you, and they say, \u201COK, thank you Ms. Goode. Just tap here to accept our services, and we will have all the data on you that we need.\u201D\nLauren Goode: So it's like Apple Pay for government?\nGideon Lichfield: Sure, if you want.\nLauren Goode: I think this is good as long as the data is secure.\nGideon Lichfield: Yeah. So what Estonia has is this advanced system for permissioning data. Different bits of the government, and also different private companies, all have data on you. But you can decide who gets to see which data from which place. This system they call the X-Road is basically a backbone for transferring data between different entities. And what's more, you not only can give permission to individual people or entities to see bits of your data, you can also see who has looked at it every single time, so you have total transparency into how your data is being used, which you certainly don't here in the US.\nLauren Goode: Ah, that must be where the blockchain comes in.\nGideon Lichfield: Somewhere in there the blockchain comes in. Yeah. It's possibly the first use of a blockchain I've actually believed in.\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: So let's go even further. Let's say you don't have to file your taxes\u2014\nLauren Goode: I'm listening.\nGideon Lichfield: You just get a notification from the government that your tax return is ready, you take a look, and if it looks good to you, you click accept, and your taxes are done.Lauren Goode: What if they don't look good?\nGideon Lichfield: Then you can change them.\nLauren Goode: OK. I'm just saying if you have, like, a quibble about something.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes.\nLauren Goode: OK. I like the sound of this too.\nGideon Lichfield: And now let's imagine you're eligible for some kind of state benefit, like disability or an education grant or childcare but you don't have to apply for it, you don't even have to know it exists, you just get a notification from the government saying that you qualify for this thing, do you want it? If yes, click here.\nLauren Goode: How does the government know you're about to have a baby? Are they spying?\nGideon Lichfield: [Chuckle] No, but if it knows you've had a baby, if you've been to the hospital and registered a birth\u2014\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: Then they\u2014\nLauren Goode: OK.\nGideon Lichfield: Kick in automatically.\nLauren Goode: OK, so there's one side of this that sounds a little bit Big Brother, and then there's another part of me that thinks this is probably how a fully digitized government should work.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. It's kind of like Steve Jobs used to say about Apple products, \u201CIt should just work.\u201D\nLauren Goode: And so, Luukas' job is to make this all work?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, not his job alone, but he is the guy in charge of overseeing the digital transformation that started about 30 years ago, and continuing to advance it across all the government.\nLauren Goode: Estonia is pretty small though, right? So to ask a question that perhaps a Silicon Valley VC would ask, can it scale? Is this something that the United States could conceivably do?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to Luukas about. Because Estonia is seen as this poster child for digital government, to the point where it's kind of become a cliché. People say, \u201COh, yeah, Estonia.\u201D But good luck trying to replicate what Estonia does anywhere else. I basically wanted to ask Luukas how exportable is the Estonian model. And he seemed to think it wasn't as unique to Estonia as you might imagine.\nLauren Goode: Well, I can't wait to hear this.\nGideon Lichfield: And that conversation is coming up right after the break.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Luukas Ilves, welcome to Have a Nice Future.\nLuukas Ilves: Thanks, Gideon, it's a pleasure to be on.\nGideon Lichfield: Are you having a nice future?\nLuukas Ilves: I am. Although for me, it's my present.\nGideon Lichfield: I think most of our listeners probably have heard that Estonia is a pioneer in digital government, but they don't know much about what that means in practice. So can you briefly talk about the key things that make it a leader?Luukas Ilves: Sure. I mean, the headline point is really simple, which is just that everything's digital. There isn't a government service or an interaction between citizen or business and government that hasn't been digitized at this point. So everything from the mundane that should be digital at this point in pretty much every country in the world, like filing your taxes, permitting of any kind to\u2014you know, some things that are a bit less digitized in most parts of the world, such as voting, where we've been able to vote online since 2004, and in our most recent elections, more than half of people did. And of course beyond just digitizing things, we have a very strong focus on taking advantage of all the sort of, the tools that new tech gives us to constantly make stuff better, whether that's better from the perspective of transparency and accountability, convenience, or cost effectiveness. So in some ways, I'd say it's almost unremarkable. We do in government what pretty much everyone in the world everywhere does with digital transformation, which is to find ways to constantly get better at what they're doing using the technologies of the day.\nGideon Lichfield: Estonia has been on this journey of digitizing government for about 30 years, so how did it get started, and why do you think it got a head start on so many other places?\nLuukas Ilves: Well, the interesting thing is we didn't get a head start, we had a very late start. So when did the US start digitizing government? Late \u201840s or the early \u201950s with a bunch of mainframes. And even countries that you don't think of as being wealthier, super technologically advanced, have been doing digital government, at least in the sense of having government mainframes running back-office processes since the 1960s. Estonia was forcibly occupied by the Soviet Union until 1991, and so in a sense, a lot of our government processes were much more backward technologically. And when we regained our independence in 1991, we effectively had a clean reboot of a lot of how government functioned, and so we got lucky in timing. We started at a time where the thinking had just radically shifted in terms of what providing a service means. We were in the era of the internet. And the second is that we didn't have a lot in the way of resources. So we couldn't just sort of take 1980s enterprise IT, because we didn't have the ability to afford IBM and Accenture to come in and build that for us. And so, you know, initially, a lot of what we did was bootstrapped, and at the time fairly young tech guys figuring out very organically, well, what makes sense, what kind of fits our functional requirements?\nGideon Lichfield: Let's talk about some of the implications of what that actually means for users of government services. So Estonia has this principle that no piece of data should have to be entered twice. How does that change the experience for people compared with a country like sitting here in the US, every time you go to see a different doctor, you have to fill in forms all over again?Luukas Ilves: That's right. So that's what we call the once-only principle. If the government has asked you for a piece of data, they don't have a right to ask you for that same data again in a different context. So that means prefilled tax declarations, where Estonians like to compete on how long it takes them to declare their taxes, and what they're really competing on is who's faster at logging on to the tax service, pressing accept, and being done.\nGideon Lichfield: How long does it take then to file one's taxes?\nLuukas Ilves: If you don't actually look at the declaration, you can do it in about 15 seconds. So what's happening in the background there is that we have a pretty good taxonomy of the data that government has, and when one public body has a reason to use data, then they go and query that from another public body based on the legal authorization they have to use that data. But the benefits aren't just around convenience. It makes our public services work more effectively, it reduces a lot of error, and a lot of the sort of difficulties in public service delivery where disadvantaged populations might not get access to a service because they don't know about some kind of an opportunity or an entitlement\u2014that you can sort of do away with. It reduces a lot of opportunities for fraud on the one hand, but also corruption on the part of officials. And it also, we at least think, makes us better at protecting our citizens' data, because instead of having massive amounts of data over-collected everywhere and generally not necessarily thawed and safeguarded too well, if we've got a piece of sensitive data, then we focus on keeping that well protected in one context, making sure the access rules are strictly enforced and making sure the right protections are in place, and then giving our citizens transparency on how that data is actually used.\nGideon Lichfield: So my sense from having visited Estonia a number of times over the last couple of decades, it's a pretty technologically literate country. But there will always be some people, and especially the elderly, who find digital services a little harder to handle, or who are especially vulnerable to hacking and having their data compromised. How do you help those people, and how do you make sure nobody's getting left behind?\nLuukas Ilves: So there's a two-part answer. The first, of course, is how you actually build your digital services to address these problems. So it's a basic, first of all, user design question, where you can have very complex services that can still be easy to use or that can be a nightmare to use. And the same thing is true for instance, for questions around identity theft or hacking. Part of having a security ID is it puts additional barriers in place to some of the usual ways in which credentials would get stolen. So for part of the elderly population, you're gonna solve that question by having easy-to-use convenient services that don't create those problems. And by the way, it's not just an elderly question, if we look at the largest proportion of calls to our help lines are actually from people in the age bracket of 18 to 25, because a lot of how government agencies design services, even Estonia, isn't really built for how Gen Z, which only uses mobile devices, which has a different expectation of user experience, how they're used to using services. So it's not always the case that younger means that they have an easier time using a service. But for the elderly, you're never gonna hit 100 percent. You're always going to have people with enough cognitive or sensory impairment that they really can't use a service, you're going to have people who just refuse to use a service, and we don't force citizens to use digital services, there is always an in-person or paper alternative. But it becomes a numbers game. The more you can move people into the online and automated channels, the more you can take the resources that you would use for in-person interactions to actually make the interaction for the complex cases work better. The idea is not that we move everyone into digitization, but that if we can move 80-20 or 90-10\u2014the vast majority\u2014into digitized automated channels, then we use the resources we have to then deal with the other 5 or the 10 percent in a way that actually pays more attention to their needs and gives them better outcomes.Gideon Lichfield: Right. So it seems like one of the big shifts that is happening at the moment in Estonia is a move to proactive public services, the idea that if you're entitled to some benefit, you shouldn't have to apply for it, it should just appear automatically. Where do you expect that to end up?\nLuukas Ilves: The idea is really quite simple, which is that the triggering conditions for most public services are written in the law somewhere. It can be anything from as mundane as, well, your passport needs to be renewed, to something a bit more sophisticated like means-testing for a public benefit. And if we know that we have the data that determine whether you are entitled to a benefit or should be using some kind of a service, then we're kind of sitting on our hands if we don't reach out to you when those data or those events indicate something should be happening. So the basic idea is just\u2014it's a convenience point, it's as simple as me getting an SMS saying, \u201CHey, your passport's gonna expire in two months, here is a link to renew it.\u201D But as you then start going through more complex events and services, you get into situations where you're notifying people of benefits that they weren't aware they're eligible for, you might in particular be focusing on disadvantaged populations where the information about the availability of these benefits isn't really there. Or you're pushing out things like, for instance, in the case of Covid, where we had additional unemployment benefits and then health benefits and support also for enterprises, you're going to the people that these benefits are meant to target without waiting for them to come to you, which should be contributing to actually achieving the desired outcome\u2014the reason for which those benefits or those targeted forms of support were created in the first place\u2014more effectively.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. I mean, it seems kind of obvious. And yet in most places around the world, it's assumed that if you want something from the government, you have to ask for it.\nLuukas Ilves: Yeah. And there may still be asking for it, I have to ask to have my passport renewed. But why shouldn't the government tell you that, \u201CHey, you can ask for it.\u201D Wouldn't you like to ask for it? Because again, all of these various forms of benefits and services, ostensibly they exist because they're in the public good and because the lawmaker wants them to be used. So if we're kind of funding something, we're creating a legal framework and then we're just failing to tell our users that it's out there, it's really sort of doing 95 percent of the work and then failing in the last 5 percent.\nGideon Lichfield: Let's talk about online voting. This year, Estonians voted, and for the first time, more than half the votes were cast online. Tell us, first of all, how that online voting system works, what makes it secure?Luukas Ilves: Yeah. So the online voting we have in Estonia is actually quite similar to a mail-in ballot. The ballot itself, you have an anonymous ballot that can only be read and decrypted by the Electoral Commission after the voting is over, and that in turn is digitally signed using your electronic identity and your signature that Estonians use every day for banking and government services. And in practice, you've got a piece of software which you download to your desktop, or from next year, on your smartphone, and you cast that ballot, it gets sent to the electoral service, and then once the voting period's over, it all gets tabulated and counted.\nGideon Lichfield: So it's a little bit like the digital equivalent of a paper ballot where you have a ballot inside an envelope which is blank, and then that goes inside another envelope which has your voter information on it.\nLuukas Ilves: Basically, with a bunch of fancy cryptography thrown in there. Yeah.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. There have been some claims over the years that the system isn't entirely secure. Various researchers have suggested that they found flaws, and clearly it's taken a while to build public trust in the system because it's only this year that more than half the population voted online. Given everything else that Estonia has been doing digitally, does it feel like this one is harder to get right?\nLuukas Ilves: Almost a decade ago, we open-sourced software, and of course researchers from across the world looked at that. And there were some\u2014they found some potential theoretical concerns, and there were a whole bunch of sort of observations of a process that were made, which we then took on board and we sort of worked through the software, we've made some updates. But at the same time, there hasn't ever actually been any form of compromise that's been discovered. The flaws that have been talked about are all theoretical and generally also have a whole bunch of technical and organizational safeguards in place, so that even if any of these flaws that for instance were discovered, would have been exploited, that wouldn't have actually impacted the integrity of the electoral process. Making these elections secure, ensuring the integrity of the process, ensuring the secrecy of the ballot and so on has always been the number one design consideration. And the slow uptake, I'm not sure it's about trust, initially it was seen kind of as geekish oddity. And people don't vote very much, so there's also, for a large part of the population here as elsewhere, there's an element of ceremony to going into your local polling booth. But it's been one of those services where the uptake, it follows an exponential growth curve, but it just takes time.\nGideon Lichfield: Obviously, the big question for all of this conversation is how easy it is for other places to do what Estonia is doing. And particularly, sitting here in the US, a lot of the stuff that you're describing sounds science fictional, just because it's hard to imagine anybody agreeing to a single centralized ID where that allows all your data to be shared across different government agencies, for example. But you lived in the US for a bunch of years, what do you think it would take for some of the stuff that Estonia is doing to be replicated here?Luukas Ilves: Yeah. So before I get to the US, let's just say that I've noticed that bunches of countries have copied what we've done, or they're taking inspiration, big and small. On the big side, India, and a lot of how they thought about the India stack was really inspired by what we did. Some countries have really copied quite directly. We've done so\u2014most recently, most notably, Ukraine's digital transformation I think was kick-started by being inspired by us, and a lot of the ways in which they've rebuilt individual services based on what we've done. Their data exchange platform is basically our X-Road and so on. And there's a long list of examples. So this does transfer, and what's been done in Estonia can be done\u2014is being done\u2014in every continent of the world. Now, we get to the US, I'd say that what I found to be most detrimental to all this transformation, and you see this in the US, you see this also in a couple other countries, I'd say Germany and Japan, is a self-defeating attitude of, well, we shouldn't even try because we probably can't pull it off. And in the US, that takes the form of deep pessimism about the capability of the public sector to do things differently. I would say the most important thing is to actually not fall into that sort of trap of prejudging yourself to failure. In English-speaking countries, the perception that the government really shouldn't be handing out identities\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: It's seen as a Big Brother thing.\nLuukas Ilves: Yeah. But you see the results that politicians in these countries, the US included, haven't really fought that fight. I mean, I think the way that digital identity is probably going to happen in the US is going to be that the actual sort of technical layer is probably going to be done by tech, and then there's going to be an interface probably which states on how you actually take the certificates and maybe even the secure hardware in your iPhone or your Android device and link that to identity credentials. And I think basically that's what Apple and Google are working on already. So I think that probably EID in the US is actually going to sort of solve itself by the back door without anyone even realizing that it's been solved. What that will require is enough people, more I think in state government, but with support from the federal government, having the courage to do that and sort of get over the initial hump. And the best thing to get over the hump is actually putting services into users' hands that they really like. You put something that works, that's fairly easy to use, and it also has some transparency on what it's doing with the data into someone's hands. And I think that most people say, \u201CHey, this is great. I'm really happy it's made my life easier.\u201D And if, in the background, the work has been done to convince the privacy advocates, et cetera, who would be really concerned about it, that actually this passes muster, you would hope they'd sort of listen to the signals. I realize that's hopelessly naive, given the political polarization in the US, but that still sort of should be your starting point.Gideon Lichfield: Do you worry about Estonia starting to fall behind, having been the leader in building these digital systems for so long, as other countries come in and innovate in their own way?\nLuukas Ilves: I don't worry about us falling behind, sadly in part because this is tough to do across governments everywhere. And so while we do have plenty of competition, we don't have as much as I think we should. But also because our main goal is to make stuff better here. So the stuff that keeps me up at night, it's not \u201CWill another country be better than us?\u201D It's, \u201CWill all the sort of normal bureaucracy of government, and all the sort of mundane challenges we have, funding cycles, programming requirements, et cetera, get in the way of doing the next cool, interesting thing?\u201D And not by thwarting it directly, but just death by 1,000 paper cuts.\nGideon Lichfield: And what makes you optimistic?\nLuukas Ilves: Right now I'd say what makes me optimistic within government in Estonia is that we've really gotten to a point where I think top management and below them, sort of the service delivery teams really across government, gets it. And we put a lot of effort into executive education, into training our civil servants, not just the technology, but how you do service design, how you think about data. And there's actually, like, a pretty across-the-board hunger to use the tools we now have to get better business outcomes. So that's the first thing that makes me optimistic. And the second thing that actually makes me optimistic is precisely the fact that we're not the only country in the world that's doing a good job at this. The fact that other countries in a couple of years time can look at what we've done, learn these lessons, and then kind of catapult themselves into being the same league with us, that gives me ground for optimism that actually governments can get better at this. And that this, you know, there isn't some kind of unique special to Estonia, sort of set of circumstances that doesn't scale, because that would actually be a really depressing conclusion. If the conclusion is actually anyone can do this, and it works for big countries and small countries, I think it's a much more optimistic conclusion.\nGideon Lichfield: Indeed. Luukas Ilves, thank you very much for joining me on Have a Nice Future.\nLuukas Ilves: Thank you.\n[Music]\nLauren Goode: So my first question, Luukas sounds like an American. I was expecting an Estonian accent, so this surprised me. Is he also an American?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, his father was the president of Estonia, then taught at Stanford for a while, and Luukas studied in the US.\nLauren Goode: OK, so more seriously, I'm still not sure I understand exactly how their data system is so secure, particularly when they do still rely on third party vendors to power some of these services. How do they make that work?Gideon Lichfield: I mean, granted that I'm not a digital security expert, but it's a system that they've built over a number of decades, that is based on this thing they call the X-Road, and what that is is simply an agreed platform that no matter what data system you use, in whatever government ministry or whatever private company, there is a kind of pipeline that you interface with by an agreed protocol that is secure. And that pipeline is what carries data from one entity's databases to another, and what controls who accesses it and how permissions are granted. And so they're using that single protocol for everything, both in the public sector and in the private sector. And they also use a blockchain as a way of making sure that things can't be changed without leaving a trace. So somebody can't interfere with the data and then cover up the interference, that whatever change is made to the data is going to be recorded in the blockchain.\nLauren Goode: Got it. OK. So provided that works as promised, it seems like it'd be pretty good for something like voting. Do you think that online voting is a good thing generally? I mean, it has a bad reputation here in the United States. Cybersecurity experts have actively opposed bills that would introduce internet voting because of how insecure they think it is. I don't know if you recall, but we had a little issue with our last presidential election.\nGideon Lichfield: There was something I heard, I think, somewhere on the news. I mean, I think it seems as if Estonia's done quite a bit of work and has taken some time, both to build up the trust and to build up the security of its online voting system. But as Luukas said, they now have more than half of the voters voted online in the last election. I think there is another argument that one might make against online voting, which is that voting is seen as a civic duty and as a kind of, it's an opportunity for people to come together. You all show up at the voting booth, you're standing in line with other citizens. You get to feel like you're participating in this important democratic process. And that if you just click a button online, maybe it won't have that effect. But I don't know if there's evidence either way that shows that that's true. We've seen voting rates decline in many, many countries where they have voting in person. So, I don't think we can say definitively that online voting makes it worse.\nLauren Goode: Right. And voting in person also creates opportunities for voter intimidation.\nGideon Lichfield: Yeah. One of the things Luukas talked about was how their online voting system allows you to vote as many times as you want, which seems weird and counterintuitive. But what he was saying was, if someone tries to pressure you to vote a certain way or even to bribe you, you could vote the way they want. And then five minutes later, you could vote again. And only your last vote counts in the system.Lauren Goode: Oh, that's interesting.\nGideon Lichfield: So that takes away the incentive to bribe people or to put pressure on them.\nLauren Goode: Wow. You could change your votes as often as you change your outfits.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. But \u2026\n[Laughter]\nLauren Goode: You wake up one day and have a totally different vibe.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. But only the last one counts.\nLauren Goode: I'm intrigued by Luukas' claim that we will get a single electronic identity here in the United States via some sort of backdoor implemented by tech firms like Apple and Google. People in tech have talked about this idea of federated identity for a long time. But also, I'm not sure this should be powered by the private sector. How do you think this would actually work?\nGideon Lichfield: It seemed to me that what Luukas was saying was, if you see what Google and Apple and I think even Microsoft are already doing, they've rolled out these things called passkeys. And the idea of a passkey is, instead of having a password for each site that you log into, your phone or your computer basically authenticates with that site and says, based on this person's fingerprint or their face ID, I can confirm that this is the person who has this identity. And that eliminates the possibility that you might have multiple logins with different emails, some passwords that are compromised, all of that kind of uncertainty. So your phone or your device becomes the identity standard for you. Once that becomes more accepted, it's logical then that government services, banks, everybody else will all start adopting passkeys. And then what happens de facto is that you have a single identity across all of these different services. And that's what I think he meant by this coming in via the backdoor, that because the tech firms have built these identity systems for us, we now start to have the possibility to swap information in theory between those services if we choose to allow it. And maybe he's suggesting that that's what's eventually going to happen.\nLauren Goode: OK. So the one thing that I can get behind that Luukas talked about, automated taxes. I mean, the US government services are pretty digitized at this point. You can buy your marketplace health insurance, file for unemployment, register your car, all that stuff entirely online. But when it comes to tax season, we still have to go looking for our W-2s, our 1099s. We either then file our own taxes using onerous services like TurboTax, or maybe you package all those files neatly and send them off to an accountant who ultimately comes back to you and says, \"Guess what? I need more forms.\" I kind of want Estonia's version.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. So when you said that US government services are already pretty digitized, I think the key difference here between the US and Estonia is, here they're digitized but still siloed. So you still have to have separate data for each of those things that you do online, and those services don't exchange data with each other, whereas in Estonia they do. But then as for filing taxes, essentially what Estonia does is give us access to your bank records and your salary records and everything else. And then we, the government, from that data, create your tax return. So you have to be comfortable with that. Now, I don't see why you wouldn't be, because ultimately you're giving them all of that information anyway.Lauren Goode: Unless you're Donald Trump, but please continue.\n[Laughter]\nGideon Lichfield: But yes, you have to now manually go through the process of compiling all of that information and giving it to the government so it can calculate your taxes. So why not just give it to them preemptively and let them do the work? That seems like a great idea to me.\nLauren Goode: So why don't we have this yet? Why has there not been a candidate for president who has said, \u201CI'm going to run on the e-government platform. I'm going to digitize all of this and make your life easier\u201D?\nGideon Lichfield: Can you imagine what an exciting governing platform that would be in the US? Wouldn't that just bring people out in droves?\nLauren Goode: I can't recall in recent history any president saying, \u201COne of my top priorities is going to be digitizing the government.\u201D And I suppose that Barack Obama did this too with healthcare.gov.\nGideon Lichfield: Which was a resounding success.\nLauren Goode: The initial rollout was rough. Painful.\nGideon Lichfield: Yeah, it was a real mess.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, so why hasn't a candidate done this?\nGideon Lichfield: I think part of it is it's kind of boring as a campaign platform in the US. I mean, the things that get people riled up are the polarizing issues like abortion and taxes and gun control and so on.\nLauren Goode: Actually, you just made me wonder, what's Estonia's policy on abortion?\nGideon Lichfield: I mean, abortion is legal in Estonia. I think the reason this is a worry in the US is that state laws vary. So where an abortion or gun ownership are legal under certain conditions in one state, they might not be in another state. And people who are traveling out of state for an abortion might not want the state they came from to know that they went and got it somewhere else.\nLauren Goode: Right. So in a totally polarized America you might have one group of people, let's say gun control activists, who really think it would be beneficial to have a centralized database of every assault weapon in the United States and who owns that weapon and who's in possession of it. At the same time, there might be people who don't believe in abortion, feel strongly it should be illegal, who also think that there should be a database of people who get an abortion. And that's a scary future.\nGideon Lichfield: But I think the thing that is often really misunderstood about Estonia's data system, which is why it might also in fact work in the US, is that it is not about necessarily centralizing a database. You could have state-level databases of who's had an abortion or who owns guns. You could even have city-level. And you, as the citizen, would have control over who gets to see the data in your state database. So you could say, I'm from Texas. Texas doesn't have the right to see any abortion data or any health data that I have from another state, for example. That's the way that data is exchanged in the Estonian system. And so that does actually allow for a lot of security. I think the problem with this discussion in the US is it would be very hard to make that clear to people. And I think people would assume that everything is being centralized and everything is being Big Brothered. I think it's a shame that this conversation is so hard to have in the US, because I actually think a lot of the distrust in government in this country especially is because government services are often so lousy. And making them more digital and making them better connected so you didn't have to spend all your time reentering data or you didn't have conflicting versions of your data sitting on different servers, that would actually make it a lot more efficient, a lot more reliable, a lot more easy to use, and it might increase trust in government. But it's very hard to see how you get there politically.\n[Music]\nLauren Goode: That's our show for today.

Blockchain watchers still hope that money trail might help to identify the perpetrator of the heist\u2014and according to one crypto-tracing firm, some clues now suggest that those thieves may have ties to Russia.\nToday, cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic released a new report on the complex path those stolen funds have taken over the 11 months since they were pulled out of FTX on November 11 of last year. Elliptic's tracing shows how that nine-figure sum, which FTX puts at between $415 million and $432 million, has since moved through a long list of crypto services as the thieves attempt to prepare it for laundering and liquidation, and even through one service owned by FTX itself. But those hundreds of millions also sat idle for all of 2023\u2014only to begin to move again this month, in some cases as Bankman-Fried himself sat in court. \nMost tellingly, Elliptic's analysis is the first to note that whoever is laundering the stolen FTX funds appears to have ties to Russian cybercrime. One $8 million tranche of the money ended up in a pool of funds that also includes cryptocurrency from Russia-linked ransomware hackers and dark web markets. That commingling of funds suggests that, whether or not the actual thieves are Russian, the money launderers who received the stolen FTX's funds are likely Russian, or work with Russian cybercriminals. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nHacker Answers Penetration Test Questions From Twitter\n\u201CIt\u2019s looking increasingly likely that the perpetrator has links to Russia,\u201D says Elliptic's chief scientist and cofounder Tom Robison. \u201CWe can\u2019t attribute this to a Russian actor, but it\u2019s an indication it might be.\u201D\nSign Up Today\nKeep up-to-date with the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried by signing up for our Daily newsletter.\nFrom the first days of its money laundering process following the theft, Elliptic says the FTX thieves have largely taken steps typical for the perpetrators of large-scale crypto heists as the culprits sought to secure the funds, swap them for more easily laundered coins, and then funnel them through cryptocurrency \"mixing\" services to achieve that laundering. The majority of the stolen funds, Elliptic says, were stablecoins that, unlike other forms of cryptocurrency, can be frozen by their issuer in the case of theft. In fact, the stablecoin issuer Tether moved quickly to freeze $31 million of the stolen money in response to the FTX heist. So the thieves immediately began exchanging the rest of those stablecoins for other crypto tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap\u2014which don't have the know-your-customer requirements that centralized exchanges do, in part because they don't allow exchanges for fiat currency.\nIn the days that followed, Elliptic says, the thieves began a multi-step process to convert the tokens they'd traded the stablecoins for into cryptocurrencies that would be easier to launder. They used \u201Ccross-chain bridge\u201D services that allow cryptocurrencies to be exchanged from one blockchain to another, trading their tokens on the bridges Multichain and Wormhole to convert them to Ethereum. By the third day after the theft, the thieves held a single Ethereum account worth $306 million, down about $100 million from their initial total due to the Tether seizure and the cost of their trades.\nFrom there, the thieves appear to have focused on exchanging their Ethereum for Bitcoin, which is often easier to feed into \"mixing\" services that offer to blend a user's bitcoins with those of other users to prevent blockchain-based tracing. On November 20, nine days after the theft, they traded about a quarter of their Ethereum holdings for Bitcoin on a bridge service called RenBridge\u2014a service that was, ironically, itself owned by FTX. \u201CYes, it is quite amazing, really, that the proceeds of a hack were basically being laundered through a service owned by the victim of the hack,\u201D says Elliptic's Robison.On December 12, a month after the theft, most of the bitcoins from that RenBridge trade were then fed into a mixing service called ChipMixer. Like most mixing services, the now-defunct ChipMixer offered to take in user funds and return the same amount, minus a commission, from other sources, in theory muddling the money's trail on the blockchain. But Elliptic says it was nonetheless able to trace $8 million worth of the money to a pool of funds that also included the proceeds from Russia-linked ransomware and dark web markets, which was then sent to various exchanges to be cashed out. \n \u201CThere might have been a handoff from a thief to a launderer,\u201D says Robison. \u201CBut even if that was the case, it would mean the thief was in contact with someone who is part of a Russian money laundering operation.\u201D Robison adds that Elliptic has other intelligence pointing to the money launderers' Russian ties, but doesn't yet have permission from the source to make it public.\nAfter their initial attempt to launder a portion of the funds through ChipMixer, the thieves went strangely quiet. The rest of their Ethereum would remain dormant for the next nine months.\nOnly on September 30, just days ahead of Bankman-Fried's trial, did the remainder of the funds begin to move again, Elliptic says. By that time, both RenBridge and ChipMixer had been shut down\u2014RenBridge due to its parent company FTX's collapse and ChipMixer due to a law enforcement seizure. So the thieves pivoted to trading their Ethereum for Bitcoin on a service called THORSwap and then routing those bitcoins into a mixing service called Sinbad.\nSinbad has over the past year become a popular destination for criminal cryptocurrency, particularly crypto stolen by North Korean hackers. But Elliptic's Robison notes that despite this, the movement of funds appears less sophisticated than what he's seen in the typical North Korean heist. \u201CIt doesn't use some of the services that Lazarus typically use,\u201D Robison says, referring to the broad group of North Korean state-sponsored hackers known as Lazarus. \u201CSo it doesn't look like them.\u201D Robison notes that Sinbad is likely a rebranding of a mixing service called Blender that was hit with US sanctions last year, in part for helping to launder funds from Russian ransomware groups. Sinbad also offers customer support in English and Russian.\nDoes the timing of those new movements of funds ahead of\u2014and even during\u2014Bankman-Fried's trial suggest someone with insider knowledge is involved? Elliptic's Robison notes that, while the timing is conspicuous, he can only speculate at this point. It's possible that the timing has been purely coincidental, Robison says. Or someone might be moving the money now to make it look like an FTX insider\u2014potentially one who fears they might be about to lose their internet access. Neither Bankman-Fried nor his fellow executives have been charged with the theft, and some of the money movements have taken place while Bankman-Fried has been in court, with only a laptop disconnected from the internet.Eventually, no doubt, the thieves will attempt to cash out more of their stolen and laundered cryptocurrency for some sort of fiat currency. Robison is still hopeful that, despite their use of mixers, they can be further identified at that point. \u201CI think they probably will be successful in cashing out at least some of these funds. I think whether they're going to get away with it is a separate question,\u201D says Robison. \u201CThere's already a blockchain trail to be followed, and I think that trail will only become clearer with time.\u201D\nTwo other cryptocurrency tracing firms, TRM Labs and Chainalysis, have both been hired by FTX's new regime under CEO John Ray III to aid in the investigation. TRM Labs declined to comment on the case. Chainalysis didn\u2019t respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment, nor did FTX itself.\nAs those cryptocurrency tracers continue to follow the money, we may someday have a clearer answer to the mystery of the FTX heist. In the meantime, however, FTX's many aggrieved creditors will be left to keep one eye on Bankman-Fried's trial and the other on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nUpdated at 8:45 am ET, October 12, 2023, to add that Elliptic researchers found links to Russian cybercriminals.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"New Clues Suggest Stolen FTX Funds Went to Russia-Linked Money Launderers","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-hack-400-million-crypto-laundering\/","tags":["","FTX TRIAL","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CRIME","HACKING"]},{"date":"10.11.2023","summary":"We talk with Michael Casey, the chief content officer of CoinDesk, almost one year after the news site brought down Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s cryptocurrency empire FTX.","post_content":"ON THIS WEEK\u2019S episode of Have a Nice Future, Gideon Lichfield and Lauren Goode talk to Michael Casey, chief content officer of the cryptocurrency news site, CoinDesk.

That's a Morin. Three, two, one. Hi, I'm Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And I'm Gideon Lichfield. And this is Have a Nice Future, a podcast about how terrifyingly fast everything is changing.\nLauren Goode: Each week, we talk to someone with big, audacious, and sometimes unnerving ideas about the future, and we ask them how we can all prepare to live in it.\nGideon Lichfield: Our guest this week is Michael Casey, the chief content officer of CoinDesk, the cryptocurrency news site that almost exactly one year ago brought down Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s multibillion-dollar crypto empire.Michael Casey (audio clip): What I find extremely frustrating is that the debate is about \u2018look how many bad people there are over here; we need to just shut this industry down\u2019 as opposed to thinking hard and intelligently about the technology itself and how we might actually create a safer system so that those bad people don't take charge of it.\nLauren Goode: Alright Gideon, I'm going to ask the question that's on a lot of people's minds: Is crypto dead?\nGideon Lichfield: Dead as in like nobody using it anymore?\nLauren Goode: Well, I mean, obviously people are still using it, but as you mentioned, I think the meltdown of FTX was a real wake-up call for crypto believers. It was so hyped up, and it ended up losing customers and billions of dollars. SBF was the poster boy of crypto, and now he's on trial for fraud, which we are covering at WIRED. And I feel like pretty much every crypto story I've read since then has been about other crypto companies or exchanges struggling because of the ripple effects of that collapse.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. And everyone's talking about crypto winter for\u2014I dunno, like the fourth or fifth time, and yet as SBF's trial was starting, the price of bitcoin was up something like 30 percent on what it was right before FTX collapsed, so a lot of people still believe in crypto.\nLauren Goode: Which still doesn't make sense to me at all.\nGideon Lichfield: And it didn't to me either, so that's one of the reasons I wanted to talk to Michael Casey.\nLauren Goode: Did you know that I used to work with Michael Casey at Dow Jones?\nGideon Lichfield: I did not.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I used to. I used to bug him to join me on a livestreaming video show that I was doing at The Wall Street Journal. I had no idea he was a crypto guy or became one.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes, he absolutely still thinks crypto is the future of financial systems, and he's in this interesting, unique position because CoinDesk is a media company whose very purpose hinges on the existence of crypto and indeed the success of crypto as a technology. But it also did the reporting that took down SBF and caused all this turmoil that we've seen in the industry.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, they actually won a big award for that recently. Did you happen to see that?\nGideon Lichfield: Oh, actually I didn't.\nLauren Goode: They won a Loeb, which is one of the most prestigious awards in business journalism, so kudos to them. But I also saw that CoinDesk was put up for sale.\nGideon Lichfield: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Was that in any way related to the FTX collapse?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, indeed it was and that's another part of what makes their situation so interesting. So CoinDesk's parent company, DCG, owns a bunch of crypto companies and assets, and the fallout of FTX forced it to put a lot of those assets up for sale, including CoinDesk itself. So Michael's challenge now is how to make CoinDesk a thriving business during this latest crypto winter.Lauren Goode: Ah, so you're saying the future of journalism is not to put all of your assets in crypto?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, maybe the future of crypto journalism is not to put all your assets in crypto, that's for sure.\nLauren Goode: OK, fair enough.\nGideon Lichfield: Anyway, I wanted to talk to Michael both to have him explain how he still believes in crypto after everything that's happened, but also to understand how a news organization that's covering this industry walks the line between being an advocate for it and also a critic of it.\nLauren Goode: Well, I'm so curious to hear what he has to say.\nGideon Lichfield: And that conversation is coming up right after the break.\n[Music]\nGideon Lichfield: Michael Casey, welcome to Have a Nice Future.\nMichael Casey: Thank you for having me, Gideon.\nGideon Lichfield: Are you having a nice future?\nMichael Casey: Ask me tomorrow. I don't know.\nGideon Lichfield: Ask you in the future?\nMichael Casey In the future.\nGideon Lichfield: OK. Well, we're speaking because it's coming up to a year after one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, went bankrupt and billions of dollars worth of its customers\u2019 money went missing, and we're here basically to talk about how the crypto world looks a year after that and how it will look in the future. But I wanna start with you. How did you start covering crypto? What made you interested in it, and what made you believe in it?\nMichael Casey: Yeah, so I was at The Wall Street Journal at the time, and I had covered currencies. I saw this strange thing called bitcoin everyone was talking about. This is in 2013. I was writing a column at the time called \u201CHorizons\u201D for The Wall Street Journal. And I don't know. I wrote some pretty basic, \"Hey, don't touch this thing. It's probably a tulip bubble\" kind of story. And then I got called in by a few people who\u2014some of whom are still in the industry, some who aren't, some prominent names, some of them big venture capitalists and others, taken out for dinner\u2014explained what it was all about. And I think because of the fact that I'd spent six years of my life in Argentina, a country that just has perpetual crises\u2014it's just never resolved it's monetary problems throughout a very long 100-year history of ups and downs\u2014and suddenly this alternative to how a monetary system could run was presented in front of me, something that didn't need a government, and it just dawned on me as just a phenomenal idea.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, so you saw crypto as a kind of an answer to the brokenness of existing financial systems.\nMichael Casey: And also just a different\u2014just fascinating that you didn't\u2014you could construct it without an institution in the middle of it. This idea that money didn't have to be issued by a government, that was just a revelation that just became a never-ending quest to explore.Gideon Lichfield: So you wound up as chief content officer at CoinDesk, which famously published the story last November that brought down FTX, and we'll talk more about that in a second. But maybe just for our listeners who don't know, describe really briefly what CoinDesk is.\nMichael Casey: We describe ourselves as the leading media events and indices company in the crypto and digital asset space.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, and so a lot of media companies that cover a particular industry, you have this sort of joint role of being a watchdog for it and also, to an extent, a cheerleader. You are interested in growing and promoting the existence of the industry itself and making it better. Does that seem fair? And I think\u2014\nMichael Casey: I think so. I always flinch a little bit, and I think you as a journalist would do as you hear the word cheerleader. Like, it's just not something we ever wanna describe ourselves as. I think that it's pretty hard to be in crypto journalism if you don't have some belief in the power of the technology. That's obviously quite different from cheerleading any particular company or even cheerleading the industry as it currently is, right? Like the two things are different.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. The thing that I think is interesting is, any industry media publication has to strike this balance, but it's an especially delicate balance in an industry like crypto where there are so many scams and grifts. So what are your guiding principles for being honest about what is going on in the industry whilst also fundamentally believing that it's a worthwhile industry?\nMichael Casey: So many scams. There are a lot, without a doubt. Like I think it would be naive to say that there are not a lot of scams. It is obviously something that we are constantly reporting on. You just have to look at CoinDesk coverage. If you truly believe, as I do, for example, that we have an a fundamentally broken internet with Google, Facebook, and these massive platforms controlling our data and manipulating us via that, and you'd love to see a system that no longer had that dependency, and people had control of their data, then you're gonna cover this industry for the sake of holding it to account so that it does improve.\nGideon Lichfield: So speaking of that\u2014speaking of holding an industry to account\u2014let's go back to the day November 2 when CoinDesk published this report on problems at FTX. Maybe just begin by very briefly describing what those problems were for anyone who doesn't remember.\nMichael Casey: OK. So the first company that now I named\u2014that everybody would be familiar with\u2014Sam Bankman-Fried had created before he created the exchange FTX, was called Alameda Research. Alameda was a trading firm, and there was always known that there was a relationship between the two companies, but we didn't really have any idea about how deeply intertwined they were until our reporter Ian Allison got ahold of a balance sheet. This is a private company that the balance sheet was not formally released, and this was Alameda's balance sheet. And it showed that a lot of the assets that it recognized on its books were actually FTT, a token that was issued by FTX. What that showed was this very circular relationship that the assets that this company held were actually completely defined by the institution of which it depended for a lot of business, and essentially it exposed a house of cards and front-running, misuse of customer funds, and an absolutely enormous number of breaches of the fiduciary duty that any exchange has to its users.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY GIDEON LICHFIELD","title":"Where Does Crypto Go From Here?","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/have-a-nice-future-podcast-24\/","tags":["","HAVE A NICE FUTURE","PODCASTS","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","BITCOIN","FINANCE","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]},{"date":"10.09.2023","summary":"The same chaotic day FTX declared bankruptcy, someone began stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from its coffers. A WIRED investigation reveals the company\u2019s \u201Cvery crazy night\u201D trying to stop them.","post_content":"BY THE EVENING of November 11 of last year, FTX\u2019s staff had already endured one of the worst days in the company\u2019s short life. What had recently been one of the world's top cryptocurrency exchanges, valued at $32 billion only 10 months earlier, had just declared bankruptcy. Executives had, after an extended struggle, persuaded the company's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to hand over the reins to John Ray III, a new chief executive now tasked with shepherding the company through a nightmarish thicket of debts, many of which it seemed to have no means to pay.\nFTX had, it seemed, hit rock bottom. Until someone\u2014a thief or thieves who have yet to be identified\u2014chose that particular moment to make things far worse. That Friday evening, exhausted FTX staffers began to see mysterious outflows of the company's cryptocurrency, publicly captured on the Etherscan website that tracks the Ethereum blockchain, representing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto being stolen in real time.\n\u201CHoly shit,\u201D one former FTX staffer, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak about internal company matters, remembers thinking. \u201CAfter all this, we\u2019re being hacked?\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nAccording to its own accounting, FTX would ultimately lose between $415 million and $432 million worth of its cryptocurrency holdings to those unidentified thieves, numbers it has publicly confirmed as part of its bankruptcy process. What FTX hasn't previously revealed is how close it may have come to losing vastly more\u2014how its staff and outside consultants raced to move more than $1 billion worth of crypto to more secure storage before it could be stolen by the malevolent presence on its network\u2014even, at one point, scrambling to send close to half a billion dollars to a physical USB drive in one consultant's office in an effort to keep it out of the thieves' hands.\n\u201CInvitation: Urgent\u201D\nAs the trial of FTX's disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried enters its second week, many in the cryptocurrency community are closely watching courtroom events for any hint of how the exchange was so catastrophically looted, just hours after it left his control. The question of who carried out that theft\u2014and whether the thieves were FTX insiders or external hackers\u2014looms largest of all. That mystery remains unsolved, and neither Bankman-Fried nor other top FTX executives have been charged with that theft.\nSign Up Today\nKeep up-to-date with the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried by signing up for our Daily newsletter.\nBut now, WIRED can reveal the events of FTX\u2019s panicky night working to limit the damage from that theft\u2014and to prevent what might otherwise have been a 10-figure heist. The new FTX leadership under Ray, its new CEO, declined to be interviewed about the incident. But WIRED learned the hour-by-hour details of the crisis response from a detailed invoice submitted by the restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsall for its work on FTX's bankruptcy case, interviews with individuals who participated in the immediate response to the theft, and blockchain analysis provided by the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic.\nThat response started around 10 pm on the evening of November 11, when Zach Dexter, the chief executive of FTX subsidiary LedgerX, sent a Google Meet invite to a group of more than 20 of FTX\u2019s remaining staff, bankruptcy lawyers, advisers, and consultants. The invitation\u2019s one-word subject line: \u201Curgent.\u201D\nA handful of staffers quickly joined that Google Meet video call, which would eventually grow to dozens of participants over the next 12 hours. They could all see FTX wallets being drained in real time on Etherscan. But almost no one on the call had any idea where exactly FTX stored its cryptocurrency or how it managed the secret keys that controlled those wallets. That knowledge was held only by a small group of FTX elite\u2014Bankman-Fried and his inner circle. Bankman-Fried never appeared in the meeting, according to sources who were present, but Gary Wang, the FTX cofounder and CTO, did join the call.By this point Wang was distrusted by many people close to Ray, sources say. In the midst of FTX\u2019s meltdown, Wang had initially sided with Bankman-Fried and had only distanced himself from the former CEO after days of persuasion from others within the company.\nWang didn't win over any of his critics in the emergency meeting when he initially suggested the ongoing theft could be halted by simply changing the secret keys that protected the wallets that were being emptied. That seemed pointless, the former FTX staffer remembers thinking, given that whoever had gained access to the network could simply grab the new keys and continue their heist. \u201CThe fox is in the hen house, and you\u2019re going to change the keys to the hen house?\u201D the former staffer remembers thinking. Wang, who has since pleaded guilty to the same criminal charges Bankman-Fried now faces, did not respond to a request for comment sent to his attorney\nJust as the Google Meet call started, however, LedgerX\u2019s Dexter had started exploring a different approach to protecting FTX\u2019s funds. The week before the theft, digital asset trust company BitGo had been negotiating with Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm overseeing FTX\u2019s bankruptcy process, to take custody of the firm\u2019s remaining cryptocurrency holdings. So Dexter now called BitGo to try to circumvent the long legal contract process Sullivan & Cromwell had begun with the company. Instead, Dexter asked BitGo to immediately create \u201Ccold storage\u201D wallets\u2014wallets that would be kept securely offline\u2014that FTX could move all its remaining funds into as a safe haven. Dexter did not respond to a request for comment.\nBitGo said it could have the wallets ready in around half an hour. FTX staffers worried that this would still be too slow. The thieves could potentially take hundreds of millions of dollars more worth of crypto out of the company\u2019s wallets by then.\nSomeone on the Google Meet call asked if anyone had a hardware wallet of their own where the money could be stored until BitGo was ready. Kumanan Ramanathan, an adviser to FTX from Alvarez & Marsall calling in from his house in the suburbs of New York, volunteered. He had a Ledger Nano\u2014a USB drive hardware wallet\u2014in his home office that he offered to set up as a temporary refuge for the vulnerable money.\nRamanathan set up a new wallet on his Ledger Nano at around 10:30 pm ET on November 11. The former FTX staffer remembers watching him check and double-check the password that he'd created for that wallet. Wang began sending FTX\u2019s funds to it, and soon Ramanathan was holding between $400 and $500 million in the company\u2019s crypto assets on a USB drive in his Westchester County home.\nA Late-Night 911 Call\nMinutes later, BitGo told the FTX staffers that its wallets were ready, and they began transferring hundreds of millions more in crypto to BitGo\u2019s cold storage instead of Ramanathan's Ledger device. For the rest of that sleepless night, the staffers hunted for every wallet where FTX\u2019s money was stored and transferred every coin they could find to BitGo. \u201CThey were scrubbing various systems trying to find where various private keys were, where assets were held,\u201D says another person involved in the response, granted anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak about it publicly. \u201CIt was just chaos.\u201D\nAs FTX's staff focused on getting executives to sign off on those transfers of potentially vulnerable funds, Ramanathan was left holding the crypto that Wang had initially transferred to his Ledger wallet. That created the bizarre situation of an individual physically possessing around half a billion dollars worth of FTX's money, which presented its own unique legal and security risks. That night, Ryne Miller, the general counsel for FTX, rushed to Ramanathan's home to help safeguard it. Ryne Miller declined to comment for this story, and Ramanathan didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.At 10:59 pm Ramanathan called the police to report a theft in progress and explain that he was holding a very large amount of the victim's money, requesting that officers come to his house to help protect it. After all, no one knew then\u2014or now\u2014who had stolen the other funds, and if they might try to physically take the stash that Ramanathan held too. A police report from the New Rochelle Police Department obtained by WIRED shows that Ramanathan told the 911 dispatcher that \u201Cthere is a huge crypto hit currently going on and that there is a large amount of money being sent to this address\u201D and that he \u201Cfears the house is going to become a target.\u201D\nEven after the police arrived, Miller, FTX's general counsel, stayed at the house for most of the night. Ramanathan's record of billable hours shows that he and Miller spent nearly three and half hours in his home, from around 2 am to 5 am, on November 12.\nNo physical threat to Ramanathan or his home materialized. In fact, the siphoning of funds from FTX had stopped when the money was moved to Ramanathan's Ledger wallet. \u201CHe took a huge fucking risk using his personal Ledger,\u201D says the former FTX staffer. \u201CHe\u2019s a total boss. It\u2019s my pretty strong feeling that if we hadn\u2019t pulled this Ledger stunt, we would have lost significantly more money.\u201D The money in Ramanathan's home office was finally transferred to BitGo by around 5 am on Saturday, November 12. The company would ultimately hold $1.1 billion of the remaining FTX funds.\nLater on Saturday, Bankman-Fried and Wang transferred another $400 million plus to accounts under the control of the Bahamas government for safeguarding, as reported by Forbes and recorded in a court filing. At some points, that movement of funds to the Bahamas appears to have been confused with the theft itself. A week after the theft, some media outlets incorrectly reported that the stolen funds had actually been seized by the Bahamian government. As evidence to the contrary, cryptocurrency tracing firms like Elliptic and Chainalysis have observed portions of the actual stolen funds being sent to \u201Cmixing\u201D services often used to launder stolen crypto funds such as Railgun and the cross-blockchain coin swap service THORChain, behavior typical of thieves who pull off large-scale crypto heists.\nFew Safeguards, No Map\nIn the months since the desperate rescue effort of November 11, FTX\u2019s new regime, which is handling the company\u2019s bankruptcy process, has publicly alleged glaring security failings that made the theft possible.\nAn April report released as part of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings listed examples of that alleged neglect: The previous FTX regime had no independent chief information security officer or actual dedicated security team; it kept virtually all its cryptocurrency in hot wallets\u2014wallets on computers connected to the internet\u2014despite employees being instructed to publicly claim that it stored as little as 10 percent in hot wallets; it left keys to those wallets unencrypted or failed to properly set up security systems where multiple keys are needed to unlock funds; and it lacked the logging systems to even know who was moving funds and when, along with many other issues.The same report describes the impossible situation that the new FTX regime faced on November 11, when, in its first day in charge, it discovered it had inherited a deeply compromised network. \u201CDue to the FTX Group\u2019s deficient controls to secure crypto assets, the Debtors faced the threat that billions of dollars of additional assets could be lost at any moment,\u201D the report reads, using the term \u201Cdebtors\u201D to describe the new FTX administration led by Ray. \u201CAs the Debtors worked to identify and access crypto assets with no \u2018map\u2019 to guide them, the Debtors had to engineer technological pathways to transfer many types of assets they identified to cold storage.\u201D\nGiven that apparently shambolic security and disorganization, it\u2019s perhaps not a surprise that FTX became the target of one of the costliest crypto heists in history. But if not for a few quick decisions in the midst of that chaos, it now appears that it could have been far worse.\n\u201CIt was a very, very crazy night,\u201D the former FTX staffer says. \u201CWe worked on it, we got it done, and we saved a massive amount of customers\u2019 money.\u201D\nUpdated at 10:35 am ET, October 10, 2023, to clarify THORChain's functionality.\nUpdated at 3:50 pm ET, October 10, 2023, to add details from a New Rochelle Police Department report detailing Ramanathan's 911 call. We also clarified that Ramanathan and Miller were at Ramanathan's home when the 911 call took place and while they awaited the transfer to BitGo.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Inside FTX\u2019s All-Night Race to Stop a $1 Billion Crypto Heist","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-1-billion-crypto-heist\/","tags":["","FTX TRIAL","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CYBERSECURITY","CRIME"]},{"date":"09.29.2023","summary":"In a cave in eastern Myanmar, a young engineer who goes by the nom de guerre \u201C3D\u201D is building weapons to fight against a brutal military dictatorship.","post_content":"\u201CWE NEEDED WEAPONS, and we needed them fast,\u201D 3D says, sitting beneath the stalactites in a dimly lit cave, somewhere deep in the jungle in eastern Myanmar. The space reverberates with the hum of 3D printers, the devices that gave 3D his nom de guerre. A network engineer, 3D comes across as controlled and cautious, but from time to time, mostly when he\u2019s speaking about his printers, a playful grin appears on his face. He spoke on condition that WIRED would not reveal his real name or show his face. \u201CMy parents would kill me if they [knew] what I\u2019m up to,\u201D he says. Not only does 3D face the risk of arrest, torture, and execution for his part in the revolution, but the military would also not hesitate to arrest his parents if they were to discover 3D\u2019s identity.\nMyanmar\u2019s borderlands have been plagued by civil conflicts since the end of World War II. Rebel groups, often delineated along ethnic lines, have sought autonomy from a state that was stitched together by the British Empire, and which unified distinct ancient kingdoms. The civil war escalated dramatically after the military seized power in February 2021, reversing years of tentative democratic progress. Thousands of people took to the streets to protest, but the military cracked down with stunning brutality, killing hundreds of civilians across the country. Many people took up arms against the regime, or joined existing insurgencies. Today, over 250 rebel groups are fighting against the military dictatorship in all corners of the country, turning Myanmar into a patchwork of front lines, no-man\u2019s-land, and islands controlled by a mosaic of insurgents.\n3D joined the peaceful protests in the eastern town of Loikaw in the aftermath of the coup and witnessed the bloody response. \u201CThey fired with live ammunition at the protesters and killed many,\u201D he says. After he saw that, 3D decided to join the revolution. He enrolled in an armed insurgent group that consisted of civilian volunteers like himself, named the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF). What he found was a resistance movement that was massively outgunned. \u201CWe had nothing when our resistance began two years ago, and we took up against a military titan,\u201D 3D says. \u201CThat\u2019s when I thought, I have to find a way to make weapons from scratch.\u201D Before the revolution began, 3D already owned a 3D printer. \u201CBut I just used it as a hobby. When I saw the urgent need for weapons, I decided to find a way to use my 3D printer.\u201D\nToday, 3D\u2019s printers are at the heart of the rebel group\u2019s in-house weapons program, producing drones, stabilizers for mortars, and other munitions to support the pro-democracy fighters. These are tools that have become closely associated with Ukraine\u2019s scrambled, open sourced defense against Russia\u2019s invasion, but, as 3D\u2019s work on Myanmar\u2019s front lines shows, the bootstrapping of warfare has become a global phenomenon.\n\u201CWithout 3D printing, someone can manufacture a very high-quality weapon,\u201D Yannick Veilleux-Lepage, assistant professor of political science at the Royal Military College of Canada, says. \u201CBut that does require a great deal of skill. You need to be a competent metal worker, and that takes a long time. With a 3D-printed firearm, it doesn\u2019t take very long to go from no skill to [creating] something lethal. That\u2019s how things are changing, the lethality and the ease of it.\u201DPHOTOGRAPH: DAPHNE WESDORP\nThe first weapons that 3D manufactured for the revolution were FGC-9s, 3D-printed semiautomatic rifles. The blueprint for the weapon was created in 2018 by a gun designer using the pseudonym JStark1809. Over the course of several years, the designs were uploaded to several easily accessible online platforms, including Odysee, an open source blockchain-based media website. FGC stands for \u201Cfuck gun control,\u201D as the gun can be manufactured without any regulated commercial gun components. It is composed of a mixture of custom 3D-printed parts, readily manufacturable metal components, and store-bought screws, springs, and bolts. JStark\u2019s motto, \u201Clive free or die,\u201D is engraved on a tag around 3D\u2019s neck.\n3D produced the first FGC-9 in the early months of the coup, and the guns were used on the front line. But it soon became clear that plastic firearms weren\u2019t up to the rigors of the battlefield, and the 3D-printed guns have been relegated to use in defensive actions or limited hit-and-run attacks. When it became clear there was no longer a need for plastic rifles, 3D started to think about how his 3D printer could help the revolution in different ways. So, in December 2022, he began working on a drone.\nInspired by a Ukrainian-made drone called the Punisher, the Liberator-MK1 was his first attempt. This small, fixed-wing reusable aircraft could carry up to 1.5 kilograms of explosives, and has already been deployed at Myanmar\u2019s scattered front lines. The frame of the drone was 3D-printed and then covered with fiberglass. The other components\u2014its battery, motor, and control surfaces\u2014have to be smuggled across the border from Thailand. As cars and fuel are both expensive and scarce in rebel-held territories, the Liberator needed to be transportable by scooter, and therefore had to be compact. \u201CThere were so many things to take into account while making the design,\u201D 3D says. \u201CBut the biggest problem we had was a weak wing structure. It couldn\u2019t support the plane\u2019s weight and broke in the middle.\u201DIn February this year, 3D refined the designs with the MK2. All told, it costs around $5,000 to produce a drone. Once all the components are in the country, they can be assembled in around two days.\nThe merging of 3D-printing technology and drone development has opened up new possibilities for both conventional military development as well as for non-state actors such as Myanmar\u2019s anti-junta fighters. Military organizations have adopted 3D-printing technologies to produce sophisticated, low-cost, disposable aircraft\u2014most visibly, and arguably most successfully, in Ukraine. This convergence has been particularly valuable to some non-state actors, like Myanmar\u2019s rebel groups. When you lack foreign allies and your borders are sealed, you need to be innovative to get hold of weapons and bypass the conventional supply chain.\nGroups like the KNDF, which consists of mostly millennials and Gen Zs, thrive on having digital natives who can find and tweak designs online. Manuals on how to weaponize and build drones circulate online, and non-state actors often learn from the tactics of other groups that are disconnected from them, or even their enemy. When the war in Ukraine started, Ukrainians were even translating Islamic State manuals that contained instructions on how to weaponize drones, in order to prepare the population to wage an insurgency in case the Russians attacked. As Veilleux-Lepage says: \u201CNo technology is neutral. Every technology has essentially the purpose for which it is built, but can be used in various ways, by people with different ideologies.\u201D\nIn Myanmar\u2019s case, what these weaponized drones offer is an opportunity to strike back in an incredibly asymmetrical war. While the rebels struggle to access basic munitions, Myanmar\u2019s military has obtained at least $1 billion in weaponry and materials needed to make weapons since the coup, according to a United Nations report that was published in May 2023. The cost of that imbalance is measured in lives. The past summer has been the deadliest for the pro-democracy rebels in the past two-and-a-half years, and casualties are reported daily.\nOn a misty morning, a dusty pickup arrives carrying the remains of a young fighter. \u201CHe died on the way here. He was injured in an airstrike,\u201D the driver says. After the fighter is carried out of the car, a medic lifts his arm and inspects the fatal wound in his side, where a piece of shrapnel has pierced his body. On his arm, he has a self-made tattoo that says \u201Chappy,\u201D covered in blood. To honor fallen fighters, three shots are fired in the air. \u201CBut even those shots are blanks,\u201D says the deputy chief commander of the KNDF, who uses the alias \u201CMaui\u201D (named for the main character from the Disney film Moana\u2014a giant, and the archetype of a warrior). \u201CAmmunition is like gold for us. We don\u2019t have the luxury to waste a single bullet.\u201D\nWhile they\u2019re training, KNDF volunteers are given only two .22-mm bullets to try to hit a target with. \u201CThe military junta can buy all the heavy weapons they want, but we barely have bullets to shoot with,\u201D says Maui. \u201CReal practice is done during active combat. But [the military] still can\u2019t defeat us on the ground, so they attack us from the sky.\u201DPHOTOGRAPH: DAPHNE WESDORP\nWith his drones, 3D hopes to redress that imbalance. One of his team members, a young man wearing a stained purple T-shirt, grumbles in irritation as he unsuccessfully attempts to set up the Liberator drone for a test run. \u201CBad compass health,\u201D a voice from the drone repeats, as it lies on the dusty earth. \u201CThat means we have a problem with the compass,\u201D 3D says, while he walks over to help his friend. \u201CWithout it, the drone won\u2019t be able to be controlled properly.\u201D\nTesting the drones is conducted at various undisclosed locations. There are spies, who might report on their position, but also junta scouting planes. When they hear the roar of an aircraft, 3D and the team operate like a well-oiled machine. Someone sprints to the drone, whose white fuselage stands out against the iron-rich red soil, and covers it with a dark net. The others hide between the foliage and under improvised bamboo roofs. Even though there is no way the scouting plane can hear their voices, no one speaks a word.\n\u201CThe launching process is the make-or-break moment,\u201D 3D says after the scouting plane has passed. \u201COnce it\u2019s in the air, we know there\u2019s no reason to worry, but sometimes it crashes due to malfunctions. There are many errors we need to consider. That\u2019s why we continue to refine our designs. Several drones have already been lost in midair.\u201D\nWhen everything is ready, a team member raises the drone high above their head in an open area, preparing for a running start. Once given the green light, he sprints a few meters, leaps, and releases the drone into the sky. 3D and the others cheer as the drone takes off, the craft growing smaller and smaller until it becomes merely a black dot against the blue sky. However, despite the promising launch from the ground, 3D\u2019s expression soon turns to disappointment. \u201CIt fell about 500 meters from here,\u201D he says.\nTwo members of the team jump on a scooter and drive off to the crash site. All that is left from the $5,000 drone is a small bundle of burned wires. 3D collects the parts that he hopes are still usable. He suspects a cable from the motor came loose, causing the drone to crash, which led to the battery exploding. \u201COff to the next one,\u201D he says, with a strained laugh.\nEven though 3D\u2019s drones have successfully attacked military command centers and outposts, it is not yet clear if they can indeed make a significant change on the battlefield. But right now, for Myanmar\u2019s rebel groups, the Liberator is the only way to visit some of the same terror they experience on their enemy. \u201C[The military] can\u2019t win on the ground, so they resort to bombing us from above. We can\u2019t defend ourselves. All we can do is hide,\u201D 3D says. \u201CDrones are the only thing we have to make them feel even a fraction of the trauma we feel when they bomb us with their fighter jets.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY DAPHNE WESDORP","title":"The Rebel Drone Maker of Myanmar","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-rebel-drone-maker-of-myanmar\/","tags":["","DRONES","DEFENSE","GUNS","3-D PRINTING","MILITARY"]},{"date":"09.29.2023","summary":"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is about to stand trial in the US.

It\u2019s not as crazy as it sounds.","post_content":"SAM BANKMAN-FRIED JUST ain\u2019t all that, says Pat Rabbitte. \u201CHe\u2019s not that remarkable \u2026 I just don\u2019t see it.\u201D Rabbitte was a customer of FTX, the crypto exchange founded by Bankman-Fried that filed for bankruptcy in November. Bankman-Fried is set to go on trial in New York on October 3, charged with conspiracy and fraud relating to the collapse of the exchange. Like hundreds of thousands of others, Rabbitte\u2019s money is tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. What happens to those creditors is far worthier of attention, Rabbitte says, than what happens to Bankman-Fried. \u201CHe is not that interesting.\u201D\nIn this opinion, Rabbitte is in the minority. Before FTX collapsed, Bankman-Fried (or SBF, to some) was very much a main character. The 31-year-old, who styled himself as the respectable face of crypto, steered the exchange to a $32 billion valuation in only three years. He courted regulators, politicians, and venture capitalists. He fraternized with sports stars and supermodels. He seduced reporters at the largest English-speaking publications. He\u2019s the \u201Cnext Warren Buffet,\u201D they crooned, the \u201CMichael Jordan of crypto.\u201D Decked in his trademark costume\u2014a T-shirt, shorts, and dad sneakers\u2014he projected a humility unlikely of the world\u2019s youngest billionaire.\nWhen FTX crumbled and the gory allegations followed, Bankman-Fried\u2019s reputation cratered too. But fascination with his character was amplified. The question shifted from \u201CHow did he achieve so much?\u201D to \u201CHow did he deceive so many?\u201D The salacious details of the sexual encounters between Bankman-Fried and his inner circle will feed into the circus of his trial, rekindling the debate about his genius, morality, and legacy. Rabbitte will follow along, but not obsessively. His focus, along with a group of other FTX victims, will be elsewhere.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nIn May, a group including Rabbitte began to gather on the messaging platform Telegram to discuss an idea that, to many ears, might sound impossible: restarting FTX, without SBF. They had all lost money to the exchange. At the end of the bankruptcy, they can expect to recover a portion of that money, though probably not all of it and not for years to come. Firing up the exchange, they think, could provide a route to a faster and fuller recovery.\nTo a large extent, FTX was SBF. It was the sum of his entrepreneurship, marketing, lobbying, and risk-taking. Now the brand is in tatters. The group of creditors, who call themselves the FTX 2.0 Coalition, believe the exchange has a future without him. \u201CThe business was essentially good,\u201D Rabbitte insists.\nBANKMAN-FRIED WAS RAISED on the campus of Stanford University, where both his parents taught. They were law professors, but mathematics was his forte. After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a physics degree, he took a job as a quant trader\u2014someone who programs software to trade for them\u2014at Jane Street Capital, one of the biggest firms on Wall Street. He was reportedly drawn by its associations with effective altruism (EA), an intellectual movement that advocates for earning as much money as possible in order to give it away. The idea struck a chord.In 2017, Bankman-Fried started his own trading outfit, Alameda Research, taking seed funding from effective-altruist donors. Early employees were mostly EAs too; it was all about earning to give. The firm focused on arbitrage trading, whereby profits are realized on tiny differences in the prices of assets across different exchanges. Specifically, it took advantage of the lucrative kimchi premium, a gap in the price of bitcoin on exchanges in South Korea and elsewhere.\nSoon, Alameda earned a reputation for profitability, says Mike van Rossum, founder of rival firm Folkvang, and Bankman-Fried as the brains behind the operation. It was apparent he was \u201Ccrazy smart,\u201D says van Rossum, of the first time he met Bankman-Fried. \u201CHe\u2019s the quickest person, like machine-quick. I haven\u2019t really seen that [before].\u201D\nSign Up Today\nKeep up-to-date with the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried by signing up for our Daily newsletter.\nA reputation as a boy-genius with an altruistic vision would become the foundation of Bankman-Fried\u2019s public image\u2014and his efforts to develop FTX, the exchange he resolved to set up. Folkvang began to trade on FTX almost immediately after it launched in 2019. A few peers were reluctant, says van Rossum, because Bankman-Fried was fairly unknown, but eventually all the big crypto investment firms were using it. \u201CIn the end, we drank the Kool-Aid,\u201D he says. Two years later, a surge in the price of cryptocurrencies brought millions of regular people to crypto investing, too. Many, like Max Windhagen, a university lecturer from Germany, chose FTX for the range of trading options available, but its founder\u2019s persona played a role, too. \u201CHe was able to come across as very harmless,\u201D says Windhagen. \u201CIt\u2019s like the nerdy kids at school. They are smart, but don\u2019t seem to possess the social skills to manipulate others.\u201D\nBankman-Fried leaned into his mythology. He was frequently in contact with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over regulation of the crypto sector, endearing him to policymakers. He also ingratiated himself with venture capitalists, who fawned over him, and the media, which lionized him. Later, he started a charitable foundation that donated millions of dollars to EA causes, under the FTX brand. He also pledged to give his entire personal wealth away.\nIn 2022, when crypto markets stumbled, jarred by the collapse of the Terra-Luna stablecoin and the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Bankman-Fried seized on another opportunity to play the hero. FTX swooped in with rescue bids for crypto exchange Bitvo and lenders Voyager Digital and BlockFi, which had been caught in the fallout. He was anointed crypto\u2019s white knight. The veneer of legitimacy around FTX grew thicker, and the exchange became the second largest in the world.\nLast November, it all fell apart. A CoinDesk report raised questions about the health of Alameda\u2019s finances and its dealings with FTX. That triggered a surge in customer withdrawals, which the exchange couldn\u2019t handle, forcing it into bankruptcy. A month later, the US Department of Justice accused Bankman-Fried of misappropriating customer funds, which had allegedly been used to bankroll risky trading activity, acquisitions and venture investments, real estate purchases, marketing campaigns, political donations, debt repayments, and loans to himself, his parents, and others. For every dollar\u2019s worth of assets a customer stores, an exchange is supposed to keep a dollar\u2019s worth on hand for withdrawal. But FTX couldn\u2019t meet withdrawals, the indictment asserts, because the money was missing.When FTX fell, many victims engaged in a self-flagellation of sorts, upbraiding themselves for their credulity. Windhagen lost a fifth of his net worth\u2014not enough to ruin him financially, he says, but \u201Cenough to really hurt.\u201D He had always been suspicious of personality cults, but for whatever reason, did not \u201Cadjust his risk assessment\u201D for Bankman-Fried. Folkvang had half of its assets on FTX, worth tens of millions of dollars. Risk management was \u201Cpushed to the back of the to-do list,\u201D says van Rossum, in the fervor of the crypto boom, but also partly because he felt he could trust the FTX executives. \u201CWe got screwed over,\u201D he says.\nThe brands that Bankman-Fried had for years so carefully curated\u2014both his own and FTX\u2019s\u2014fell to pieces in the span of a week. In an interview with Vox a few days after the bankruptcy, he said the quiet part aloud: It was \u201Cjust PR.\u201D\nTHE PRECISE ORIGIN of the push to restart FTX is unclear. It\u2019s possible multiple parties came to the idea at once. But in January, a back-of-the-envelope calculation started a discussion. Sunil Kavuri, an FTX creditor with a background in finance, valued the exchange at roughly $8 billion, based on transaction volumes for the previous year. It was a crude calculation, Kavuri admits, that didn\u2019t account for intangibles like reputational damage, but it also illustrated the potential for FTX to be worth more to creditors alive than dead.\nKavuri proposed a debt for equity swap. The FTX exchange would be auctioned off to outside investors who would inject capital to get it back on its feet, and those owed money by FTX would be given a stake in the new exchange. If FTX 2.0 succeeded thereafter, the value of each creditor\u2019s equity might some day exceed the amount they originally lost, creating an incentive for those people to use it. \u201CThe key is that the exchange has much greater value as a going concern,\u201D says Kavuri, \u201Cthan split into its parts.\u201D Intrigued by the idea, private equity firms and crypto media began to contact him to ask about his valuation.\nThe FTX 2.0 Coalition was born a few months later, of the idea that, for a reboot to be taken seriously by John Ray III, the restructuring expert in charge of the FTX estate, small creditors needed to make themselves heard. Typically, the interests of creditors in a bankruptcy are represented by an Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Committee (UCC), which has a formal voice in negotiations, but the group felt a grassroots approach was necessary. In one of the earliest messages on Telegram, Loomdart, the pseudonymous founder of the group, said he hoped to form an \u201Carmy of people.\u201D Everyone should help to spread the word, he said, because \u201Cthe most important thing is pure eyeball exposure.\u201D So far, the coalition has almost 3,000 members.\nThe plan to reboot the exchange has its detractors. The main objections revolve around the damage done by Bankman-Fried to the FTX brand and the cost to an outside investor of rebuilding a viable business from the wreckage. Reports compiled in the wake of the collapse, after all, suggested FTX had next to none of the accounting, data security, and corporate governance systems one might expect of a legitimate business, so what precisely would an investor be purchasing?\u201CA reboot is certainly optimistic. It\u2019s highly unlikely, from a practical standpoint,\u201D says Alan Rosenberg, a partner at the law firm Markowitz Ringel Trusty and Hartog, and member of the American Bankruptcy Institute. \u201CFTX was a total mess. There was nothing right about it. An investor would need to be willing to invest in the time, energy, and money to completely restructure and revitalize [the exchange].\u201D\nAlthough a reboot is possible from a legal perspective, says Rosenberg, the deficiencies of the FTX business mean restarting the exchange will require large amounts of capital and a wide range of expertise. \u201CIt\u2019s a huge undertaking. You\u2019d have to create a whole new company,\u201D he says. \u201CI don\u2019t know what there is to sell, beyond the customer base.\u201D\nRegulatory hurdles might also stand in the way, says Thomas Braziel, founder of 507 Capital, an investment firm that has taken a multimillion-dollar position in the FTX bankruptcy by purchasing debt from creditors. The estate administrators will need to convince the SEC and CFTC that any outstanding business defects have been cured, or otherwise face objections in bankruptcy court. A reboot is not necessarily a Hail Mary, says Braziel, who is open to the idea in principle, but \u201Cit\u2019s a more aggressive play than going for par.\u201D\nIN SPITE OF the objections, in July, the FTX 2.0 Coalition received its first real indication that its advocacy work might be paying off. A draft reorganization plan filed by Ray proposed that FTX assets be marketed to investors with a view to starting a new \u201Coffshore exchange company.\u201D The plan was bare-bones, but showed that a reboot was at least under consideration. A presentation deck published on September 11, meanwhile, revealed that multiple parties have submitted bids to invest in the new FTX.\nNeither Ray nor FTX responded to requests for an interview. But according to Braziel, who relayed a conversation with Ray from early July, the FTX estate is serious about the prospect of a reboot. Ray is \u201C100 percent behind it,\u201D says Braziel.\nWhether the FTX 2.0 Coalition has helped to steer Ray\u2019s thinking is an open question. It doesn\u2019t have a line to Ray\u2019s team, nor does it have a voice in the bankruptcy court. But its members are convinced the noise they\u2019re generating is making a difference, by signaling public support. Attorneys from Alvarez and Marsal, as well as from Sullivan and Cromwell, two firms employed by the estate, recently began to follow members of the coalition on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201CWe know they\u2019re taking notice. I\u2019m convinced,\u201D says Rabbitte.\nThe multiple bids, meanwhile, suggest that prospective investors are buying into what the group has long been saying: that what\u2019s left of FTX is just a list of customers, but an immensely valuable one. That list, the argument goes, is the product of hundreds of millions of dollars (allegedly of customer money) spent on marketing FTX and dressing the image of SBF, its mascot. \u201CThe most important thing [an investor would be purchasing] is us,\u201D says Rabbitte.FTX had managed to accrue more than 9 million customers under Bankman-Fried, a (loosely) estimated 1.4 million of whom are creditors in the bankruptcy. Even though not every creditor will want to use FTX 2.0, those that plan to continue trading crypto will be incentivized to stick around. As equity-holders, a portion of trading fees and profits generated by their activity will make its way back into their pockets. The new exchange would start life with a horde of customers, all of whom are invested in its success, without lifting a finger.\nLarger creditors like Travis Kling, the founder of Ikigai Asset Management who is owed the 18th largest sum by FTX, have also lent their voices to the coalition. \u201CIn the current landscape, exchanges are fighting tooth and nail over customer acquisition,\u201D he says. \u201CHaving hundreds of thousands of customers on day one gets over the cold-start problem,\u201D he says.\nThere is also plenty of room in the market, says Kling, for a new exchange that\u2019s cleaner than clean. The world\u2019s largest, Binance\u2014charged earlier this year by the CFTC and SEC with a litany of violations and reportedly under investigation by the US Department of Justice\u2014is facing a \u201CCategory 5 shitstorm,\u201D as he describes it. In this context, there is a \u201Cclear opportunity to come in and compete.\u201D\nThe hope is that something positive may yet come, says Loomdart, of the great fortune that was spent on the Bankman-Fried boosterism, so crucial to attracting people to FTX. The new exchange has the opportunity to succeed both because of Bankman-Fried\u2014or rather the customer list he created\u2014and in spite of him.\n\u201CPeople say the FTX name is tarnished, but I don\u2019t view it like that,\u201D says Loomdart. \u201CFTX was Sam. It got to where it was because of him. That\u2019s true. But it\u2019s not about restarting Sam\u2019s FTX. It\u2019s a different beast entirely.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Can FTX Be Revived\u2014Without Sam Bankman-Fried?","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/can-ftx-be-revived-without-sam-bankman-fried-sbf\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","FINANCE","SILICON VALLEY","BANKS","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED","FTX TRIAL"]},{"date":"09.27.2023","summary":"During the crypto gold rush, Idris Elba says he turned down a lot of \u201Cmad opportunities.\u201D Now he has partnered with the \u201Ccrypto-for-good\u201D Stellar Development Foundation.","post_content":"IDRIS ELBA LEARNED about crypto at the same time as almost everyone else: when prices went through the roof.

That\u2019s the question facing senior leaders across the UK who hope to keep pace with technology innovation and retain their organisations\u2019 competitive advantage.\nIt\u2019s no secret that technology moves quickly, and keeping ahead of the curve can be challenging. But trying to predict the future, and where the world of business is headed can often be futile- however, that doesn\u2019t mean companies don\u2019t try.\nBusinesses will routinely invest huge amounts of time, effort and resource on horizon scanning-often with limited success. Horizon scanning, company monitoring and other tools are all the focus of investment budgets, but can only provide so much information. They\u2019re often lagging indicators, telling businesses what things were like in the recent past. They\u2019re also anonymous, detached data points that don\u2019t always link to the unique pressures individual businesses face or provide actionable insight into how things can be changed.\nWhilst senior leaders can sometimes find reassurance in research investment, more often than not, transformative insights can be found from within the company, and derived from the people who keep it turning- your workforce.\n\u201CIn a race to induct the most cutting-edge technology, some business leaders can fall into the well-trodden trap of prioritising the technology, and then perceived need for it, over their people, and their actual need for it,\u201D Benoit Laclau, consulting managing partner for the UK and Ireland at EY.\n\u201CWe often ask our clients: \u2018Are you reframing the future, or is the future reframing you,\u2019\u201D says Laclau. The question is designed to prompt thinking about hoped for growth aspirations against the backdrop of the changing market- and whether the company is leading the way, or being led by change. Establishing that core principle- of what investment is needed where, at what level, to best benefit the business- is done through collaboration with stakeholders across an organisation, including customers, employees and citizens. By putting stakeholders at the heart of transformation projects, EY teams are better able to establish which investment areas should. be prioritized and for what purpose.\nItalian news organisation Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA) approached EY teams with a complex problem: they needed support to help provide transparency in the origin of the news they were reporting. Staggeringly, falsehoods are 70 percent more likely to be retweeted on social media than the truth, according to research by MIT Media Lab, which can undermine the reputation that news agencies such as ANSA are keen to preserve.\nTo see how ANSA\u2019s news stories spread across the internet, EY teams implemented a blockchain based solution; when an editor publishes a news story it\u2019s fed into the system automatically, with its ID and publication details in a block that is made immutable through notarisation on the blockchain. When these stories are published online, they are given an \u201CANSACheck\u201D sticker that readers can click on to see who has written and potentially republished them. ANSACheck enables readers to confirm that news origins are true and trusted, and drives a deeper understanding of the news process \u2013 which is particularly relevant if a story is controversial.ANSACheck came into its own during the Covid-19 pandemic, when disinformation thrived and many readers asked about the origin of some stories that mentioned ANSA as a source. ANSA was able, through ANSACheck, to confirm that the source of the stories was not authentic. It combined the best of both worlds: a data-driven, human-centric approach can help affect meaningful change.\n\u201CInvestment for investment\u2019s sake isn\u2019t worth it,\u201D says Laclau. \u201CIt needs to have a purpose for leaders to see a return on their investment. In the Tech Horizons survey conducted by EY teams, 71 per cent of respondents ranked talent and culture in the top three success factors for transformation. Businesses that exceed expectations combine people and technology to grow their business faster. It is rarely the case that technology alone helps businesses to innovate- successful transformation relies on designing technology around user needs and putting people at the heart of change, as ANSA did.\u201D\nBut delivering on the promise of human-centric transformation is often easier said than done. EY teams are brought in to help initiate and deliver change within businesses with whom they work to avoid falling into the trap of rolling out a technology that doesn't meet needs of the business or its stakeholders.\nTo discover how ANSA used blockchain technologies to restore trust in news and deliver a people-centric transformation, read the full case study, then see how EY teams can help you.\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65e9c239d124d70f3ad1c002\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Wired_EY_2.jpg","author":null,"title":"Unlock greater value from your transformation investment","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/four-key-investment-areas-for-business-leaders\/","tags":[""]},{"date":"08.03.2023","summary":"This week on Gadget Lab, we discuss the local-first computing movement and its push to reduce our reliance on the corporate-owned, cloud-based software tools we use every day.","post_content":"CLOUD COMPUTING HAS streamlined our hyper-mobile digital lives.

You're no longer in a Zoom window, you're now actually in a chair.\nGreg Barber: Yes, yes, big upgrade.\nMichael Calore: Today we are talking about local-first computing. The term is probably new to you, but the concepts behind it might make sense to you. Local-first computing describes a type of software that lets you collaborate on files with people on other computers. I'm here at the office and I'm typing into a document; you're across town at a coffee shop, and you have the same document open on your computer, and you see all of my changes appear on your screen in real time. Sounds just like Google Docs, right?\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm.\nMichael Calore: And every other web-based collaboration tool. The approach of local-first computing is conceptually similar, but the way it works behind the scenes is quite different. Now Greg, you have written a feature for WIRED that is appearing online this week. People can read it on WIRED.com, and it's about the local-first computing movement. So you know all about this because you've been researching it and interviewing many of the people behind it, so we're hoping you can start the show by explaining to us how local-first computing is different from cloud-based computing that people are familiar with, like good old Google Docs and Slack, and things like that.Greg Barber: Yeah, yeah. So as you said, conceptually it's actually going to be pretty similar for the average user of this kind of software. You're working on a text document, or you're working on some kind of image file, and similar to Google Docs or Photoshop, you're making edits, you're making changes, and you might be doing that with other people. But in this case the idea is that you can do a lot of work offline without any internet connection to another person, and you can make a whole bunch of changes. And then when you come back this magical little alchemy happens where all the changes resolve from you and whoever else is editing the document into a result that makes sense. And again, that doesn't sound all that different from Google Docs, I think in part because we're pretty used to just having an internet connection at all times. You might occasionally get that little dialog that comes up on Google Docs if you do go offline that says, OK, this is the tab where you can make the changes, and then everything else is suspended. But basically it's depending on having a copy of that file stored in a server somewhere. It's one of Google's servers probably in some data center in the desert of Oregon, and the changes are all being made there. Whereas in this case. the changes are being made on every copy of the file that is distributed among the people who are editing it. And like you said, Mike, that involves some pretty tricky math and computing that was actually developed a long time ago but didn't really get much use and is now seeing a resurgence.\nLauren Goode: Is this technology or this protocol using the big cloud services still, like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services?\nGreg Barber: A little different from that. So actually you are, in this case, peer-to-peer. So basically the file is only existing on your computer and the computer of the other people who have access to that file, who might be collaborating on it. And then rather than keeping some sort of master copy on a Google server, instead when you all are making changes and you sync up and you have an internet connection, then the changes are happening on everyone's computer. So it's almost like, I compare it in the piece to quantum entanglement, atoms that need to always be in the exact same state even if they're halfway across the universe from each other, the changes will always resolve on each computer into the exact same result. And hopefully it's an intuitive result, and that's where it gets a little bit tricky.\nMichael Calore: So what you're talking about is decentralization.\nGreg Barber: Exactly.\nMichael Calore: Which is a word that pops up a lot in computing these days. How does local first computing fit into the discussion around decentralization?\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's a really long history to this, of course. This goes back to basically the origins of the internet, where from the start there was this open protocol, the internet. It's pretty great, heard of it?Michael Calore: Heard of it.\nGreg Barber: Everyone can participate, everyone can build things on top of it, build different technologies. And the magic of it is that unlike prior technologies, like our telephone lines, which are owned by telephone companies who regulate the use of those wires, anybody could participate, and people were really excited about this. But from the beginning there were people who thought, actually, maybe some companies should get involved and they should play a role in managing how internet traffic is moving. So this is all to say, there's a really long history to basically fighting for the decentralization of the internet. And this became particularly true as people started building applications on top of the internet, people starting basically allowing the internet to do things for us, like we could have applications to check your email or talk to other people.\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm, you describe it beautifully in the piece where you say, a lot of the tech companies have built these gorgeous gardens, and so enticed us to go into the gardens, and then they started building the walls around them.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And that's particularly true in the early 2000s with the beginning of the cloud computing revolution. It starts off with Salesforce, basically white-labeling servers to people; they could put their own branding on them and interact with their customers that way. And then you've got Flickr, you've got Gmail, you've got all sorts of different applications that are based on this model of having really great software that does a lot of useful things, but then it's rooted in needing to interact with a company's servers. So as that's happening, I think the voices that have been calling for internet decentralization have been getting louder, because this does tie into a business model that, as you said, Lauren, pulls people into these walled gardens, keeps them there, and keeps their data stuck on certain servers. Some people are pushing back on that. So there are movements like the decentralized web movement, Tim Berners-Lee is a big force in that. There's the crypto-related stuff, the Web3, which is a word that I've not used much recently. So you could think of this kind of programming, this local first, in that tradition. And in fact, its technical roots really reach back to that tradition as well, for people who are a part of earlier movements.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: So this more recent movement towards local-first computing you discovered through discussions on Hacker News, you ended up chasing down some of the folks who are involved in this. Tell us about them, and what was their motivation for starting this movement, or restarting this movement?\nGreg Barber: This has been a recurring viral subject on Hacker News, which is this website that, as I'm sure, many listeners are familiar with, where a lot of engineers go and post interesting things, and they get upvoted and more people read them. And so local-first has been a big force there, Whenever something new comes out, it seems to just shoot right to the top of the page. So I actually came across this, oh gosh, I think four years ago now, it was before the pandemic. And there was what I came to think of as a manifesto posted by a group of researchers, primarily based at this private lab called Ink & Switch, led by a software engineer named Peter van Hardenberg, who was a former engineer at Heroku, which was this startup that became quite large based actually in spinning up cloud servers for people, very much at the heart of the cloud computing revolution. It was eventually purchased by Salesforce and they did some time there. And then they're working with another computer scientist named Martin Kleppmann, who is originally from Germany. He had taken a tour as well through the startups and some of the big companies, like LinkedIn, but he came out really interested in exploring these old ideas in peer-to-peer software, and among them was a concept called CRDT, or conflict-free replicating data type.Lauren Goode: Conflict-free replicating data type.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah, and when you break it down, that garbled jumble of words makes some intuitive sense. Basically it refers to a type of data structure, so ways of moving around data and organizing it in a computer program, that can be merged together in ways that are conflict-free. So that's going back to where you have many different computers and they all have a copy of the file, and they need to figure out a way to take your changes, Lauren, and my changes, and your changes, Mike, and make them all resolve into the same thing, so you want it to be conflict-free.\nMichael Calore: Without conflicts.\nGreg Barber: And you also want it to be replicated: The three of us all have this file. So that was developed primarily by a French computer scientist named Mark Shapiro. He was working in the mid-2000s, at the very height of this cloud computing revolution. He was interested primarily in collaboration software. And at the time there wasn't really great internet connectivity, so this was a pretty big problem generally in computing. He was himself a peer-to-peer advocate, but it wasn't something that the cloud had really figured out either. He had a funny moment where he was working on this, and it felt like a very niche subject. He was toiling away, and he was working on CRDTs and this way of merging things offline, and he was like, nobody's going to be interested in this. And then a couple weeks later he says, boom, Google Docs.\nLauren Goode: Oh, interesting.\nMichael Calore: But Google was not using CRDT?\nGreg Barber: No, no, they're still relying on Google servers. So you can go offline, you can do your thing. There's some limited capabilities for multiple people being offline, but you're going back to a Google server when you want to merge those changes, whereas in this case there's no server between the three of us.\nMichael Calore: But he probably saw that as a clear indication that the world is ready for this.\nGreg Barber: Exactly, yeah. Collaboration software is here. Google's doing it, everybody, it's 2006 or 2007, people love Google and are very excited with every new Google product that's coming out.\nMichael Calore: Let us not forget about Zoho and Zoho Office also at the same time.\nGreg Barber: Oh, I'm not familiar.\nMichael Calore: Oh, they do the same thing, they make an office suite collaborative.\nGreg Barber: Got it. So yeah, basically he develops this, and people aren't all that interested. The cloud computing people are like, eh, that's not particularly useful for our purposes, because we want our servers anyway. And then it's forgotten for a while, but then Martin picks it up. He'd been through the startup grind, and he's now working as a research scholar at the University of Cambridge. It's in the mid-2010s, and he starts looking at this algorithm and thinks it's really interesting. How do you actually do these kind of complicated merges? But he realizes as well that it's not particularly useful to engineers like himself; it's just too inefficient. It's not integrated in any way with all the different tools that have grown up around cloud computing. So he sets about trying to implement it himself.  He wants to code out this algorithm in a way that people can actually use and start building apps.Michael Calore: All right, well let's take a break, and we'll come right back with some more.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: Greg, something you note in your story is that all of these applications that are out there now that are being demoed, they're all pretty young. They don't have a lot of the features that we would expect from mature cloud-based apps, especially the ones that they're competing with. So there's an artisanal feel to a lot of them. It must be hard to live your life the way that you are currently living it using these apps with all of their limitations, and I feel like doing so probably requires a level of patience and dedication that most people don't have.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, definitely. And this is a problem that's been dogging peer-to-peer software as long as it's been around. Mark Shapiro, the researcher who came up with CRDTs, I asked him at one point, what does your life look like online as a peer-to-peer hardliner, as he puts it? And he's like, \u201CWell, basically I avoid the internet.\u201D\nLauren Goode: He avoids the internet as we know it, because everything he does is peer-to-peer?\nGreg Barber: So basically there aren't alternatives available to him. He would like to be out with his friends using a bunch of peer-to-peer software, but everyone else got tired of it, and he would basically be alone if he were trying to communicate peer-to-peer with people online. Nothing really took off, and I think it's right, as you say, Mike, that it typically does involve trade-offs. It involves more user difficulty, and you lose features. I mean, the cloud is just super, super useful. , Of course there are these business models that favor the cloud, but at the core of it, cloud computing is just a very useful technology.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, it's 20 years old and has hundreds of billions of dollars thrown behind it.\nGreg Barber: Exactly, yeah, yeah. It's at the root of almost all software that we're using on a daily basis now. So that's part of it, that the technology is just very new and it's hard to build apps still on top of this. But then they really hope that, down the line, because there's this solid theoretical foundation for how to make these apps efficient and keep the servers out of the equation, that actually you can build interesting software that maybe goes beyond some of the capabilities of the kinds of applications we use every day. One example:  Kleppmann has recently been working on a prototype of an app that's for rich text editing. So it's basically Google Docs. But his idea for it is that it would be closer to something like Git, the software that computer programmers use to share their code. In that case there's this idea of pushing and pulling changes and\u2014\nMichael Calore: Checking things in, checking things out.Greg Barber: Yeah, yeah, and there's version controls; you can see the various versions that people are trying to add to the common code base. And as a computer programmer, he finds that very useful. He thinks that if you can see all these different versions and you can spend a lot of time offline doing your own thing, and then you bring it back, that that's actually a richer program than Google Docs, which is just relying on us tinkering with the same copy, essentially.\nLauren Goode: I have a couple of questions that might be annoyingly pragmatic. So the first is that a major part of having a robust optimized cloud experience is having lots of engineers who are constantly working on maintaining and approving the infrastructure, and big tech companies tend to have the resources to hire those engineers. So in Kleppmann's vision, who are the people who are ultimately maintaining these peer-to-peer local-first computing services? And my second question is, all right, so how is this new version of the cloud going to be monetized? Because we know that's coming.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yep. Yeah, so to answer\u2014\nLauren Goode: Senator, we sell ads.\nGreg Barber: Yes. So to answer your first question, I think they're really hoping that they can peel people away from the existing dominant cloud computing world. And it was interesting speaking with these folks during and after the big boom in cryptocurrency; there was this moment \u2026 So I should say they're not big fans of cryptocurrency themselves, despite there being some overlap in terms of the terminology around decentralization, and things like that.\nLauren Goode: Oh, interesting. Why is that?\nGreg Barber: I think two aspects: One is that just technologically it's actually in some ways the opposite. Because while local-first is meant to be offline, cryptocurrency relies on a blockchain, so you're always tethered to the technology.\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm, and it's very energy-intensive.\nGreg Barber: Mm-hmm, yeah, and controlled in this monopolistic way by whoever has the most cryptocurrency in the network, or the most computing power. And we'll get back to the money, but I think that they find crypto in general to be money-motivated. It's not necessarily for the improvement of software, it's more about, OK, how can you monetize the cryptocurrency that's flowing around the network? The apps are kind of secondary. But it did offer this interesting lesson for the local-first folks in terms of, how do you peel away those engineers from the cloud computing firms? And I think it showed that people are really interested in these principles of decentralization and data ownership and the kinds of things that are enabled if you're not worrying about cloud computing anymore. So that was heartening, and it also showed the way of, OK, how do you generate a little bit of hype around this? And I think even, something I talked about in the piece is that even the phrase local-first software is itself sort of a marketing term, it's a way of projecting values. And the viral hacker news post, this is all part of building some kind of movement where this is interesting, it's technically interesting, but it's also philosophically interesting and something that you want to join.Michael Calore: It's antiestablishment, it's altruistic.\nLauren Goode: It's farm to table.\nMichael Calore: It's farm to table, it's more pure.\nGreg Barber: Yeah. But then I think that speaks to your second question, which is that those things can often conflict with making money, and that we still have this dominant paradigm of, you go to a venture capital firm, you get a bunch of money, and then they want their money back times whatever magnitude\u2014\nMichael Calore: How dare they.\nGreg Barber: \u2026 in a few years. And one could say, \u201CHow dare they,\u201D in terms of the scale, the scale of the monetization that's required. So that is a tension for them, and it's honestly one that, if I'm being totally honest with you guys, I didn't feel was fully answered in the reporting. I think part of that can be excused because it is early, and Kleppmann and Peter van Hardenberg, they're still in a position where they're working on implementing CRDTs, and they're getting voluntary contributions from companies that are interested in local-first, and things like that, but they're not seeking venture capital funding themselves. But at the same time, I think they recognize that somebody's going to have to do it. And there is this question of, OK, are the technical underpinnings of this enough to prevent people from reaching immediately for these traditional business models? Can you let the technology lead in terms of, it's pointing to this future where you don't hoard people's data, will people rely on that technology to make in what their opinion would be the right choices around monetization? That's it too, I think that their main argument is that they're going to make really good software, it's going to be more useful than Google Docs, it's going to recruit users and stand for itself. And I think that's the big open question: Do people go for the old conveniences, or do they get inspired to pick up something new that might be truly more interesting and more useful than what came before it?\nMichael Calore: I do love the vision of the better internet. I mean, we're not talking about going back to banging rocks together and rubbing sticks together to start fires, we're talking about using these great technologies to just build something that is better and maybe more private and more secure and more friendly to our human existence.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah.\nMichael Calore: These giant libraries where everything about us is stored and used against us.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah, and that's definitely true. And something that I haven't mentioned is it does enable certain things that the cloud doesn't, for example, end-to-end encryption, where if you're not relying on a server between you and me, then it's substantially easier in some ways to avoid prying eyes on our data. Again, the general public \u2026 in some ways end-to-end encryption, it should be a general use case, but it can be a little bit niche too. I don't know if it reels people in in the way that you might hope.Michael Calore: This is why everybody's flocking to Signal.\nGreg Barber: Exactly, yeah.\nMichael Calore: Sorry, not to throw shade at Signal, but yeah, end-to-end \u2026\nLauren Goode: No, we're all on Signal. If anyone has any tips, get in touch with us.\nMichael Calore: Please. But end-to-end decryption is not a really big selling point for the general populace, it's a selling point for nerds like us.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, yeah. And perhaps in a suite of other additional great things that can come out of this, it's another selling point.\nMichael Calore: All right, Greg, this has been fascinating. Thanks for coming on the show and talking all about your new feature about local-first computing that everybody can read on WIRED this week.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, thanks for having me.\nLauren Goode: And in studio too, it's a local-first Greg Barber.\nMichael Calore: It really is, this has been a fully peer-to-peer discussion.\nLauren Goode: But stick around for recommendations.\nMichael Calore: We'll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right, welcome back. Here's the last section of our show, where we all go around the table and we offer our recommendations for things that listeners might be interested in enjoying. Greg, what is your recommendation?\nGreg Barber: I'd like to recommend in exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art right now that's called The Visitors. It's by an Icelandic artist, musician, whose name I'm going to butcher, I'm very sorry, but it's Ragnar Kjartansson. I had it pulled up on my laptop. So I went last weekend, and it's basically, you go into a room and there's a whole bunch of screens around you, and each screen is a portal into a different room in a giant house in upstate New York where Ragnar, I'm going to go with his first name, he traveled with his friends and fellow musicians, and they basically recorded a enormous jam session between all of them. But they're each in their own room, they each have a single mic, a single camera. And just this amazing thing unfolds where you just watch this individual process of music making that's somehow happening through the walls and through the floors of this house, and\u2014\nMichael Calore: Could they hear each other? Did they have monitoring?\nGreg Barber: Yeah, they can hear each other. But it's an hour long, I stayed for the full hour. I was very lucky to arrive when it started. I can't help but see some local-first allegories in it, which honestly only occurred to me just now. Yeah, I would really recommend it. It's also often in New York; it's shared between New York MoMA and SFMOMA and trades between the two.\nMichael Calore: So if you happen to live in the culturally inferior museum town of New York, then you can still see this thing that we lucky ones here in San Francisco get to see.Greg Barber: Yeah, it'll come back to you eventually.\nLauren Goode: Always throwing shade at New York City.\nMichael Calore: Well, that was sarcastic.\nLauren Goode: Oh, OK.\nMichael Calore: Because it seems like there's a museum on every corner in New York.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nMichael Calore: Or so I'm told, I've never been. That's a good one, it's a good recommendation. Thank you.\nLauren Goode: Have you ever heard of something called The Met?\nMichael Calore: The Met.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, if you work for Condé Nast you have to know what The Met is.\nMichael Calore: Is that like meta?\nLauren Goode: No, oh my goodness.\nMichael Calore: Like Facebook?\nLauren Goode: Let's move on please.\nMichael Calore: Lauren, what's your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation, I wish it was more clever or unique, like Greg's recommendation, or even local. It's not. I have finally completed my Barbenheimer quest. I went to go see Barbie, I did not see it back to back with Oppenheimer. We saw Oppenheimer together, Mike, a few weeks ago, I saw Barbie last week. And if you have not had the chance to see it yet and you're on the fence about it, I recommend it for the experience. I'm going to say something that if stripped out of context would sound like a dig, I fell asleep during Barbie, but I have good reason for that. One, I was tired, so that's always a good reason to take a nap. Two, I went with a friend who wanted to go to the 10:50 showing. This is Kara Swisher, by the way. She's often known as the most feared technology journalist out there, and you should just fear her in general. She's a person who wants to go to movies at 10:50 at night, and then we'll still go home afterwards and call the cable company and yell at them and rearrange her furniture, while she's probably, I don't know, yelling at Bob Iger too. So she wanted to go to a 10:50 showing, we compromised, I said, \"No, I cannot stay up that late,\" we compromised, we went to an 8:50 showing. Still I was very tired, and the chairs were very comfortable. I saw probably two thirds of Barbie, so I feel like I got the gist, and I woke up just in time for the ending, so I saw how it concluded. I really enjoyed it, the parts that I was awake for.\nMichael Calore: You were Kentertained?\nLauren Goode: I was Kentertained, and I'm glad I gave Greta Gerwig my money. I think it's an incredible feat that she made this film, I found parts of it to be really humorous and touching. I thought that Ken's discovery of the patriarchy was honestly one of the funniest darkly funny parts of the film. I also really loved Kate McKinnon's character, and Margot Robbie, as we all know, is a star. And yeah, I just think it touched on some really important themes around feminism and the patriarchy, and put it all in a Pepto-Bismol pink wrapper that made it go down really easy.Michael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, that's my recommendation, go see Barbie. Or at least, if you're not going to go see in the theaters, then see it on demand.\nMichael Calore: And take a nap.\nLauren Goode: And take a nap.\nMichael Calore: If you're tired.\nLauren Goode: If you're tired from fighting the patriarchy, you're going to need a nap. OK, Mike, what's your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: I'm going to recommend a podcast, a particular episode of a podcast that I've recommended in whole before a few years ago. It's called The War on Cars, and it's a podcast about safe streets advocacy. They talk about cycling, they talk about pedestrian issues, they talk about the difficulty that we have, particularly in North America, of breaking the car dominant culture, and the problem that so many people live far away from places that they need a car to get to, and we have not solved that for them. So the podcast in general is very good. This new episode is an interview with Bob Sorokanich, who was the editor-in-chief of Jalopnik, and before that was a high up editor, like a masthead level editor at a very large car magazine that is well known. And Bob and the hosts of this show are basically in opposition on many things car, but they manage to have a really, really interesting conversation about why we are where we are with cars. Why SUVs have dominated the market, why cars just keep getting bigger, what's the problem with EVs? Why can't we adopt EVs fast enough? Where does all the marketing money go? Why do people spend so much marketing money to sell cars to people who don't necessarily need them? It's really fascinating. It's an hour, I think it's a Patreon episode that they liked so much that they released into their feed during their current vacation that they're on, they're on summer vacation right now. So I would recommend, if you have any interest in automotive journalism or in the car industry and how it works and behind the scenes stuff, you got to check it out, it's really great.\nLauren Goode: Sounds fascinating.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, yeah.\nLauren Goode: Also, the way you said that they don't always agree on car made me think about Ken, because Ken beaches, that's what he does.\nMichael Calore: Oh, he beaches.\nLauren Goode: They use the word beach as a verb in Barbie.\nMichael Calore: I love that.\nLauren Goode: So it just made me think, they car on the podcast, that's how they do it.\nMichael Calore: I love that.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it's pretty good. Can we just take a moment, by the way, to read aloud a little note from a loyal fan?\nMichael Calore: Oh, sure.\nLauren Goode: So at the end of last week's show we mentioned that someone had written an and said something unkind, but also grammatically incorrect, which we had to flag, as journalism and English majors. So following last week's episode we got a lovely note from someone on Apple Podcasts named Yilish. Yilish, we don't know who you are, but we appreciate this. They said it was a great show, been listening to the show for about two years, thank you for your loyal listenership. \"Just listened to the future of Hollywood episode and I felt compelled to leave a review saying that all of the journalism majors and non-journalism majors at WIRED are people who do know things about tech!\" We appreciate you, we love hearing your thoughts, all of you, so please leave us a review.Michael Calore: That's great.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: And I feel like this is a great episode to read it on, because what other podcasts this week are you going to hear a mention of CRDTs and End-to-End encryption?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I mean, we love this stuff. We're skeptical, sometimes, but we love it, that's why we do what we do here at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: Oh, Greg, thanks so much for being here this week.\nGreg Barber: Yeah, thanks for having me.\nLauren Goode: So great to have you here, Greg.\nMichael Calore: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on the social medias, just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth, we will be back next week, and until then, goodbye.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]\nLauren Goode: Goodbye. Oh, I don't really like my recommendation, that's why I'm kind of like-\nMichael Calore: I think it's a great recommendation.\nLauren Goode: All right, it's yeah, I'll just-\nMichael Calore: I want to hear what you have to say about Barbie.\nLauren Goode: OK.\nMichael Calore: I'm ... Kenterested?\nLauren Goode: That made me laugh.\n[Everyone laughs]","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/64cabe5357ff6ec62db8a907\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Gadget-Lab-Podcast--Local-First-Gear-GettyImages-1211954492.jpg","author":"BY MICHAEL CALORE","title":"A New Wave of Peer-to-Peer Apps Heralds a Farm-to-Table Internet","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/gadget-lab-podcast-607\/","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","SOFTWARE","INTERNET","OPEN SOURCE"]},{"date":"08.03.2023","summary":"Tired of relying on Big Tech to enable collaboration, peer-to-peer enthusiasts are creating a new model that cuts out the middleman.

Rather than getting lost in its unknowns, instead focus on its underpinning technologies...","post_content":"THE METAVERSE IS a fuzzy concept. It\u2019s generally taken to be a vision for a future internet comprising a network of virtual experiences. But there are differing takes on what this might look like. Most versions of the idea feature certain key technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and virtual worlds \u2013 but do conventional devices such as PCs also have a role to play? Would the virtual worlds be interoperable? Is blockchain core to the idea or just a sideshow? And is this prediction for the future of the web even likely to happen in the first place?\nThe fuzziness is compounded by the word itself. It was coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash, where the metaverse was an alternate, digital reality. When the word was appropriated by Silicon Valley around two years ago, its usage was generally aligned with Stephenson\u2019s idea. But, since then, it has broadened almost to the point of meaninglessness. \nSo, how should business leaders approach this subject? Here\u2019s a suggestion. Rather than getting lost trying to untangle the competing definitions and assess the likelihood of the grand forecasts, it can be helpful to go back to basics. The metaverse might be a nebulous concept, but it encompasses technologies and ideas that are real things in the here and now. Separating out those component parts, assessing them on their own terms and considering whether they may have relevance for the organisation \u2013 regardless of whether 'the metaverse' happens \u2013 can prove fruitful. Here are five key areas to follow\u2026\nVirtual reality\nWhen most people talk about the metaverse, the group of technologies they have in mind typically includes VR. This is an immersive digital experience achieved using a headset with near-eye displays and motion tracking. VR can be used with a variety of media \u2013 innovations such as 360-degree cameras, for instance, allow live action films to be shot for VR \u2013 but in the metaverse context it is most associated with exploring virtual worlds. \nThe earliest such computer-generated environments were the text-based games of the 1970s, such as Colossal Cave Adventure, in which the software describes the surroundings and narrates the action. As computers became more sophisticated, so did the virtual worlds these games could conjure. Text turned to graphics \u2013 initially 2D, later 3D \u2013 and then they shifted online. As this happened, virtual worlds came to be used for purposes other than what might be strictly understood as gaming. Platforms emerged where users could collaboratively create content, for example, and game worlds morphed into social spaces where users might gather in large groups to watch a digital concert as much as fight out a battle royale. This has led to a recent proliferation of virtual realms encompassing everything from brand-built experiences to purpose-built \u2018alternate reality\u2019 platforms. Many are simply accessed over a computer or phone in the conventional manner, but a number of these offer VR support and some commentators expect this to become increasingly commonplace. \u201CThis will be a game changer,\u201D says Sam Hamilton, creative director of Decentraland, a browser-based virtual world. \u201CVirtual worlds work best when people are fully immersed in them, and only then will digital life feel more like a human experience.\u201DSo, what else does the future likely hold for VR? Beyond hardware improvements (see below), two trends stand out. One is the ability to support ever larger numbers of simultaneous users in the same virtual environment. Right now, technical constraints mean hosting more than around 100 users without trade-offs in functionality is a challenge, but improvements in computing power are starting to change that. The other trend is the rise of hardware that can capture data from the physical world \u2013 satellites, 3D scanners \u2013 and feed this into a digital environment. Some speculate this could lead to computer-generated simulations looking increasingly like reality. \nHow is this changing business?\nCommercial activities in virtual worlds typically centre around brand marketing and selling virtual goods. As for VR more broadly, organisations are experimenting in a variety of ways, albeit cautiously. For the entertainment industry, say, VR is a new potential revenue stream \u2013 and not just for gaming. The NBA broadcasts basketball live in VR, allowing users to watch the action as if they were sitting courtside. The remote audience is represented as digital avatars; viewers can move around the \u2018venue\u2019 and interact with each other.\nIt\u2019s not just about consumer applications. Whether it\u2019s meetings, co-working or onboarding, a range of traditional \u2018back end\u2019 business activities are being trialled in VR. Meta Horizon Workrooms, for example, integrates meeting rooms, video calls and presentation tools. Some believe VR experiences improve on the conventional approach. If the creative team at a car company is collaborating on a new design, for example, being able to view it in VR can aid understanding. Or consider training, which can be made safer in a simulation \u2013 if you\u2019re learning to operate a crane, say, the stakes are much higher in real life. VR can also enable new forms of learning. Taking apart a virtual model of the machinery you\u2019re being taught how to fix is arguably more compelling than studying a 2D diagram.\nAugmented reality\nThe idea of bridging the physical and virtual worlds is central to the metaverse conversation, which is why augmented reality is seen as a core technology. But the concept of using screens to overlay digital content on the real world has been around for decades. Consider the \u2018head-up displays\u2019 long used by fighter pilots to view flight data without having to look down at instruments. But it wasn\u2019t until the smartphone hit its stride in the late 2000s that augmented reality came into its own. The combination of portable high-definition screen, web connection, fast processor and integrated camera has enabled a wave of AR apps that turn the phone into a \u2018window\u2019 for mediating the physical world. Many of the use cases are practical: replacing foreign language text with a translation, or previewing how a piece of furniture might look in your home. But AR is also being used for entertainment, allowing users to view geolocated digital artworks, add filters to social video posts, and play games that place characters in the world around them. \nSome futurists predict that AR devices \u2013 mobile phones but also emergent wearables such as AR glasses \u2013 will eventually come to incorporate 3D scanners and powerful graphics chips. These could rapidly map the dimensions of the physical environment relative to the device and overlay reality with a richness and seamlessness that is currently impossible. This is often referred to as \u2018mixed reality\u2019 \u2013 \u2018true AR\u2019 \u2013 where the physical and digital worlds are blurred in a manner that is completely persuasive. Imagine walking down the road wearing AR glasses, for example, and seeing present day London re-skinned as a William Gibson-style cyberpunk city. How broad are the use cases?\nAugmented reality is not just focussed on consumers. Use cases are emerging across a range of domains, from industrial maintenance to military logistics. A particularly promising area is medicine. A number of start-ups offer dedicated AR-based medical devices and some doctors are already using these as a matter of course. Take Dr. Timothy Witham, professor of neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery at Baltimore\u2019s Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Since 2020, he has been using an AR headset made by Chicago-based company Augmedics to assist with inserting spinal instrumentation \u2013 screws and rods \u2013 during spinal surgery. \n\u201CThe spinal cord and nerve roots are literally millimeters next to where you're putting in these screws, which demands very high accuracy and precision,\u201D says Witham. Traditionally, he would rely on X-rays and his understanding of anatomy to insert those items freehand. The view through Augmedics\u2019 headset, however, overlays the spine with the patient\u2019s CT scan imagery \u2013 a little like X-ray vision. \u201CWhen we're going to put a screw in, I can see exactly where it's going with millimetre accuracy,\u201D he says. \u201CThis technology is about 98 percent accurate, which compares favourably to any other method for doing this.\u201D \nWitham believes augmented reality holds significant potential not only for other types of spinal procedure \u2013 he has successfully trialed it for removing spinal tumours \u2013 but also for other areas of medicine. \u201CEventually it will spill over into other disciplines, I'm confident about that,\u201D he says. \u201CI think it will be applicable to removing brain tumours in the future, and I do think it will have applications in other types of surgery such as orthopaedics and abdominal surgery.\u201D\nHardware\nThe range of hardware that falls under the metaverse umbrella is broad. It spans everything from regular smartphones and computers, on the basis that these can be used to access virtual worlds, through to motion-tracking wearables for operating avatars. But the device category that most people have in mind is dedicated headsets for AR and VR. Over the past decade and a half, there has been a renewed interest in developing this hardware among tech companies such as Meta \u2013 and other major players are rumoured to be entering this market in the near future. The ambition is to create affordable, powerful, small headsets that can offer a high-definition experience. Those who believe that \u2018the metaverse\u2019 is the future of the internet foresee this hardware becoming so compelling that it comes to enjoy mass market, smartphone-level adoption globally.\nShould businesses expect this shift any time soon?Headsets are still evolving, and their prices are still high. This, in turn, has stunted the predicted boom in VR and AR adoption. That\u2019s because this hardware represents an almighty technical challenge: it has to operate within many technical constraints yet be more capable than even the most powerful games console. A major issue is miniaturisation: packing a broad range of systems into a small space \u2013 motion trackers, cameras, high-resolution displays \u2013 alongside the required processing power and battery life to render high-quality graphics on the fly. This is not only a computing problem, it\u2019s also a manufacturing problem, because it can\u2019t be solved by combining off-the-shelf components. Much has to be made from scratch. \n\u201CAR eyewear has more challenges than VR,\u201D says Simon Windsor, co-founder of Dimension Studio, which makes volumetric content for major brands. \u201CIf you want to re-skin the world around you \u2013 for virtual content to genuinely and believably coexist in our physical world \u2013 you're reliant on performant eyewear, you're reliant on computer vision, you're reliant on compute, graphics and connectivity. There's lots of technologies, which are required to synchronise to provide a seamless and compelling experience. We don\u2019t have those capabilities in an optimal form yet.\u201D\nAvatars\nAn avatar is a graphical representation of a human that allows them to interact with other users and the virtual world around them. Indeed, more than a billion Meta avatars have now been created. The word itself comes from Hinduism, meaning the \u2018descent\u2019 of a god to Earthly form, but was first used in the contemporary sense in 1985 with the game, Ultima IV: Quest Of The Avatar. Rabindra Ratan, an associate professor who studies avatars at Michigan State University, says that there are three main types, although they do overlap. First, avatars that are simply tools for performing tasks \u2013 you probably think of your car in a driving game as a utilitarian object more than \u2018you\u2019. Secondly, avatars as social others \u2013 when you play as Mario, you likely see him as having a different identity and narrative from your own. Finally, the avatar as \u2018me\u2019 \u2013 you identify with the avatar as a self-representation. \u201CIn most metaverse conversations, we're thinking about this latter usage,\u201D says Ratan. \u201CThough, of course, you might represent yourself differently from who you really are.\u201D \nIndeed, avatar aesthetics range from the anthropomorphic to the fantastical, and can be further adapted with clothes and accessories. New generative AI tools are making it easier to create all kinds of avatars, notably ones that can imitate the user with uncanny photorealism. The reason many virtual world platforms opt for low-fi or cartoonish avatars is to reduce processing requirements, but this constraint may lift as Moore\u2019s Law takes its course.In terms of the future, Ratan is particularly excited about \u201Cthe potential for ownership over a single avatar that could be used across multiple digital contexts\u201D, adding that it could nevertheless adapt its look to specific situations \u2013 more formal for work purposes, say, more expressive for social purposes. \u201CThat would let us feel even more identification with the avatar, and I think the locus of identity for humans will start to shift once we can do this.\u201D People may feel more authentically represented by their avatar than their real self, he says \u2013 especially if augmented reality glasses let others view us re-skinned as an avatar in the real world. \u201CBut that\u2019s an even further future direction.\u201D\nWhy is this relevant to businesses? \nRight now, business applications centre on helping people create avatars and selling digital clothing. For companies exploring digital fashion, the notion of a future where an avatar can represent you consistently across multiple virtual experiences is an exciting one. That\u2019s because it implies a degree of interoperability between virtual experiences. If that becomes possible, then it seems reasonable to think that those digital belongings may be able to move with the avatar. This would give customers a greater reason to buy those items, and also presents brands with a bigger marketing opportunity.\nIn years to come, other kinds of opportunities may arise outside of the bounds of virtual worlds themselves. If AI enables photoreal, \u2018digital twin\u2019 avatars become widespread, for instance, fashion retailers could use these to let customers preview e-commerce purchases of physical items.\nNFTs\nA non-fungible token (NFT) is a record on a blockchain that certifies ownership of a digital asset, such as an artwork. The idea took off in the developer community in the mid-2010s, and gained wider popularity in 2017 through online games based around trading NFTs. Since then, independent creators and major businesses alike have sold everything from digital wearables to music as NFTs \u2013 and the marketplace has been on a rollercoaster. At its peak in 2021, NFT artworks were being auctioned for tens of millions of dollars. But as crypto markets tanked over the course of 2022, so did the market for NFTs.\nNevertheless, NFTs still feature prominently in metaverse discourse because a virtual economy relies on being able to prove ownership of digital files, and also because an NFT establishes scarcity and, therefore, value. If there are only 10 NFTs for an artwork, it constrains perceived supply of an infinitely copyable asset.How are brands using NFTs?\nNFTs have been used as rewards in games, membership cards and loyalty program points. Generally, however, brands are gravitating towards two main applications: virtual art and virtual clothing. Virtual fashion platform RTFKT, for instance, made headlines two years ago when it sold 620 pairs of digital trainers for $3.1 million in seven minutes. It has since been acquired by Nike. \nWhat do people get wrong about NFTs?\nNFTs are freighted with misapprehensions. Although the term is often used to refer to the virtual objects over which you have ownership, an NFT is technically just a digital record on a blockchain. That record is associated with your unique crypto wallet ID and includes a link to the digital file in question, which is hosted externally. This establishes provenance, sure, but let\u2019s be clear: that file is not itself \u2018stored on the blockchain\u2019. The digital assets themselves are thus more vulnerable than many believe. It\u2019s also a common misconception that these files can be ported with ease between different digital platforms.\nWhy are people buying NFTs?\nClearly, much of the market is driven by speculation. But Benoit Pagotto, founder of RTFKT, says that\u2019s not the whole story. \u201CFor sure, a lot of people are doing it initially for investment, but then they realise they have become part of a community. I think that\u2019s what makes people stay in the end. They have a sense of belonging to something greater than themselves, which is I believe a cultural revolution powered by blockchain technology in the background. And the thing with blockchain is it\u2019s transparent \u2013 you can see what everyone is buying \u2013 so you can tell who is here to speculate and make money and who's here to collect and stay for the long run.\u201D \nBut aren\u2019t NFTs just a mechanism to create artificial scarcity? \u201CThere are lots of brands that could make a lot more output than they do \u2013 that controlled scarcity is just part of how you build your brand and your product. That\u2019s true in the watch industry, the car industry, the diamond industry,\u201D he says. \u201CBut on the digital side, we never had that option until now.\u201D\nWhat\u2019s happening at the cutting edge?\nThere\u2019s an increasing interest in using NFTs to merge the physical and digital worlds. RTFKT sells physical trainers that contain NFC (near-field communication) chips. \u201CWe call them \u2018World Merging chips\u2019,\u201D says Pagotto. The user scans the chip with their phone to acquire an NFT version of the shoes. \u201CThis helps authenticate the item. Counterfeiting is a big problem in the luxury industry. And these chips are opening a lot more possibilities of the future where, for example, we could do physical events where you can only enter if you have the physical sneakers with the chip inside.\u201D\nThe future\nTechnology does not develop deterministically. No matter how much innovators attempt to will a technology into existence, it\u2019s up to the market to decide if it wants it. What\u2019s more, the evolution of technology is recursive rather than linear: new tools give rise to new behaviours which give rise to new use cases and therefore new technologies. These two factors make future gazing a precarious exercise. \nSome anticipate that the notion of the metaverse \u2013 if we still use that term in years to come \u2013 will eventually incorporate frontier technologies such as volumetric video screens (which show 3D images without the need for special glasses) and brain-computer interfaces (which let users operate computers via thought alone). This is clearly highly speculative. But so too are many of the forecasts we\u2019ve been discussing. \nSo, where does this leave organisations who need to strategically plan for the future? Here are a few guiding principles. For one, keep time horizons short \u2013 trying to forecast beyond two or three years is practically impossible. For another, unless you need to be at the bleeding edge, look at what others are doing in the here and now, track those that innovate early, and learn from the mistakes of the early adopters. Finally, remember: the future belongs to those who not only can best weed out the signals from the noise, but who are most able to adapt when that future arrives \u2013 whatever form it may take. After all, the only certainty is change.\nLearn more about marketing in the metaverse on meta.com.\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","post_cover":null,"author":null,"title":"How to Think About \u2018the Metaverse\u2019","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/how-to-think-about-the-metaverse\/","tags":["","BRAND LAB","PROMOTION"]},{"date":"05.16.2023","summary":"Multiplayer titles like Minecraft encourage creativity, but prototype games built on the blockchain claim to give players more meaningful independence.","post_content":"THE PITCH SOUNDS like an echo from the distant crypto past, when the blockchain was not only going to fight climate change but also cure cancer.

Archival audioclip (Back to the Future): I'm from the future.\nLauren Goode: Alright, I'm gonna ask the question that everyone's wondering about: What is a futurist? Is this a real job?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, I mean, I think some people imagine it's just, you know, a guy who sits around making predictions about the future, and there are probably some people who do just that. But Noah calls himself an applied futurist, by which he means that he studies trends\u2014technological, economic, demographic, political, you name it. And then he works within institutions like the government to help them take those trends into account in their decisionmaking and their policies. So how should they think about the impact of AI, for instance?\nNoah Raford (audioclip): I was having a conversation with a Ghanaian friend recently, and the potential for AI and all the tools which represent in that kinda larger space has for basically dysfunctional failed states and second-order semi-functional states, which is most of the world in some argument, is absolutely huge.\nLauren Goode: All right, so he sounds pretty positive on AI, but we don't actually know how that's going to shake out yet. I'm wondering if you two talked about things he has predicted accurately in the past or some things he got right.\nGideon Lichfield: I mean, he made a pretty good call on Covid.\nNoah Raford (audioclip): Called that early. I stopped going into work two months before it became a commonly accepted thing. When I had to go into work, I was wearing masks and everyone was yelling at me like, you're freaking people out. Why are you doing this?\nGideon Lichfield: And of course we talked about climate change. \nNoah Raford (audioclip): We still labor under the belief that we can stop climate change, and that's just not true.\nLauren Goode: Huh. That's pretty jarring to hear. What are we supposed to do with that kind of information?\nGideon Lichfield: Well, I think there was this undercurrent to the conversation with Noah, which was that being a futurist is not just about predicting the future or even about working with governments or other institutions to capitalize on it, but it's about being ready for it emotionally. Noah's kind of like a future therapist.\nArchival audioclip (2001: A Space Odyssey): I can see you are really upset about this. You ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.\nLauren Goode: Well, therapy typically leaves me feeling a little drained and like maybe I need three days to process whatever was discussed. So I look forward to hearing your conversation with Noah and then maybe you and I can cry together afterward. \nGideon Lichfield: Yeah, I mean, we may cry, but I think you'll feel somewhat uplifted because even though he says some really alarming things, uh, I think Noah takes the premise of the show and kind of flips it on its head. For him, the question isn't \u201CIs this the future we want?\u201D It's more, how do we get ready for the future that's coming both technically and emotionally. That conversation with Noah Raford is after the break.[Break]\nGideon Lichfield: Noah, thanks for joining me on Have a Nice Future. Are you having a nice future? \nNoah Raford: I'm having a great future.\nGideon Lichfield: Well, I would kind of expect a futurist to be having a great future. But this future that\u2019s coming\u2014it's climate change, it's AI, it's floundering democracies, and as you readily admit, it's pretty scary. So how do we prepare for that? \nNoah Raford: Yeah, there's a cognitive fallacy which I like to use called the future logical materialism trap, and it comes from an old book on Buddhism called Spiritual Materialism, the idea that if you just meditate enough, you're gonna achieve enlightenment and that enlightenment is an escape from suffering. And if you dig deeply into Buddhism and spiritual traditions, it's not the case. You can't \u2026 Enlightenment is not the alleviation of suffering, nor is analysis the alleviation of uncertainty about the future. The future logical materialism fallacy states that there is a certain amount of data which you can analyze and that if you just think about the right thing, if you pay attention to the right thing, you won't get surprised or you'll find the advantage. And that's an illusion, that's a trap, because there is no right thing. Everything is falling apart at once. Everything is changing simultaneously. And there's no amount of data you can analyze, there's no amount of trends which you can research or time which you can spend to actually discover what's gonna really happen in the future. You just end up stressing yourself out and missing the real changes which are happening around you 'cause you don't know what to prioritize and you spend all your time in this analysis paralysis.\nGideon Lichfield: I see. That's a lovely parallel. I like that a lot. And I think it's kind of reassuring \u2026\nNoah Raford: It is.\nGideon Lichfield: \u2026 to understand that we can spend time thinking and we don't have to find the answer. That doesn't mean that we've done a bad job.\nNoah Raford: That's precisely right. And then that opens to the question of, well, what can you do? If it's not a question of data collection and of analysis, then what is the right response to have here? What is a healthy emotional response to the terror of the future and the excitement of the opportunities presented to us? And really that gets down to something which has nothing to do with analysis or even thinking. That's much more of an emotional response to the actions which we're able to take in our lives, be they large or small. And a funny application of this is when it comes to climate change. Objectively, it is materially irrelevant if you recycle or not. Objectively, it is absolutely irrelevant to the course of this planet if you use plastic straws or not. It makes zero difference to the outcome of climate change. However, subjectively, that might be an action which you can take consciously, which makes you feel better about being aware of this issue and trying to gain some power over that huge terrifying issue in your life through small actions. And that's important. Because the key thing here when you face this terror of the future is for us to be able to translate that terror into excitement and opportunity is we have to feel some sense of agency, and the only way to feel agency is through action, small, medium, and large.Gideon Lichfield: So taking action is more important than whether it's the right action\u2014the perfect action to take. The most important is to have agency and do something. What are one or two things that you think are important, pretty likely future trends that most people are not paying enough attention to\u2014maybe one that's scary and one that's positive? \nNoah Raford: Well, my go-to answer for this historically has been climate change and AI. Thankfully, we're becoming more and more aware of the reality of climate change, but we still labor under the belief that we can stop climate change and that's just not true. We cannot. We cannot. The damage has been done. We might be able to lessen the consequences of it, but ultimately, our entire lives and certainly our children's entire lives are going to be spent dealing with the consequences of climate change. And that's going to produce dramatic, extraordinary historic shifts in all areas of our lives, which even those of us who do this on a day-to-day basis have a hard time really emotionally accepting. We're likely to see a billion-plus climate refugees in our lifetime, which is going to drive state failure, border clashes, xenophobia, racism, currency collapse, the collapse of electricity grids, food stresses, more pandemics, that's a terrifying thing to really live with. About once or twice a year, I have a conversation with my children that we're pretty lucky, but it's a pretty high likelihood that we're gonna be refugees at some point in our life.\nGideon Lichfield: That's quite a lot to set them up for.\nNoah Raford: It's quite a lot. And what's been interesting about this in terms of both parenting but how you or all of us deal with these sorts of scary, big changes over time, is when you first have that conversation, it's terrifying and you ignore it, or you deny it. And the second time, you accept a little bit more, and the third time, it's scary but you're able to sit with that fear a little bit more, and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth time \u2026 So by having this conversation every six months, over time for years and years and years, you get to this point that is normalizing an emotional experience of dramatic change and it shifts from being a terrifying life-ending horror show into something which is just like, \"Okay, yeah, if it happens, what will we do? Where would we go? How would you adapt? What might be exciting about this? Who would you wanna spend time with? Where would \u2026 \" These sorts of things. It becomes more proactive 'cause you're gradually taking away the terror and the emotional pain of our comfortable lives being ripped away from us and therefore preparing for a more exciting future.\nGideon Lichfield: What\u2019s something that\u2019s coming up that you think we should be excited by instead of terrified by? \nNoah Raford: Right. So that's the terrifying question. And again, my traditional go-to answer here has been AI, which was something which very few people outside of the field were paying attention to until about, I don't know, two months ago when GPT-3 came out.Gideon Lichfield: Okay, so now everybody knows about GPT and its variants, but you're also seeing people warning about use cases, like someone can just use it to cook up any number of recipes for toxins and how to distribute them, all sorts of possibilities for mischief that just now become much easier. So what makes you confident that it's net positive rather than negative? \nNoah Raford: The thing that excites me about that is because unlike most other emerging technologies to date, the degree of public discourse around the risks is exceedingly high. Like my father who's quite intelligent but pretty elderly at this point and not quite engaged in these issues, is forwarding the articles about OpenAI's discussion of the risks of this for misinformation and for using this for toxic chemicals and these types of things. So the degree of public awareness of this and the degree of conversation in the public realm about the risks and opportunities is really quite extraordinary. It's quite extraordinarily sophisticated. And it's just the tip of the iceberg here. We're going to see all sorts of regulatory experimentation around this soon as people struggle to deal with the copyright implications and the cross-border or jurisdictional issues of these things, and the issue of IP, if you upload a document that is under NDA or medical data to one of these services then. Who owns that? Where does that go? Have you breached HIPAA terms? All this stuff is really materially present right now and is being debated in every industry right now at a very advanced level. And that gives me hope.\nGideon Lichfield: There was this survey of 700-something AI experts that has been making the rounds, that asked them if they thought that, what was the likelihood basically of AI leading to human extinction or serious human incapacitation of the human race as a civilization\u2014words to that effect\u2014and 50 percent of these experts said they thought there was a more than 10 percent chance. Isn't that a pretty scary number? \nNoah Raford: I think it is pretty scary, but also I think that's a pretty honest assessment of the existential risks which we face, not just with AI, but really in terms of climate, in terms of nuclear exchange, in terms of additional pandemics, in terms of the total collapse of the financial system. I think that part of being future savvy in today's world is looking clear-eyed at the real terrible potentials of these technologies and not just turning your back on them like a bad parent who doesn't wanna have anything to do with the world their children is living in, but actually really engaging in these questions. Now, is 10 percent too high? Does that mean we shouldn't try to explore the implications and benefits of this? I would argue, no. \nGideon Lichfield: Does it mean though we should slow down the deployment of it, maybe? \nNoah Raford: Is that even possible? Gideon Lichfield: That's a fair question, but it certainly makes the case that I think that you're making, which is that we should be talking about this a hell of a lot more.\nNoah Raford: Absolutely. That's my fundamental point when it comes to AI. The thing that is encouraging about that is that unlike greenhouse gases or cigarettes, or the dangers of vaping, or the dangers of automobile reliance, or obesity, or diabetes, these chronic conditions, unlike so many of these other large social issues, there is a pretty robust conversation going on around AI because it has exploded into everyone's lives in such a public way that people can experience on a day-to-day personal basis. And I think that's at least the beginning of an exciting conversation around this. And that coupled with the extraordinary potential which this offers is fundamentally exciting because one way or another, we're going to have a forcing moment in the next decade or so between climate, economic failure, state collapse, large-scale populist movements and even potentially revolution, and the absolute destruction of much of the labor force by AI is gonna force us to fundamentally reevaluate what we mean for us as a society. What does economy mean? What does society mean? What is the world that we actually wanna build in here? And that conversation is gonna probably be violent. It's probably gonna be uncomfortable. It's gonna have different forms in different countries. But it's going to become the genesis of what the next couple of versions or iterations of human society look like through a decade or two of experimentation and discord and strife. And that's freaking exciting because the world is falling apart and we need to start building a new world.\nGideon Lichfield: I can't wait. And I'm also thinking of the privilege that people like you and I have to be the ones who can lead and convene and take part in that conversation instead of just being washed back and forth by the consequences of it.\nNoah Raford: Absolutely, but one of the things that \u2026 Obviously, we're extraordinarily privileged to be able to think about these things and talk about these things, but one of the things that encourages me\u2014and I still live in Dubai, and Dubai is the crossroads of human civilization\u2014there are more expats who weren't born in the UAE living in Dubai than any other city in the world. And you have these conversations in coffee shops, at the market, in your office with so many different people and people from all walks of life are engaging with this. And I'll tell you the people who I've found who are most excited by this are people coming from developing contexts. This is South Asia, this is East Asia, this is North Africa. Why? Because these are the people who have historically been screwed out of benefits of the 20th-century globalized project. They've been the one on the receiving end of the extractive mechanism. And now suddenly, at least for the moment, there's the glimmer of hope, the possibility that that system is falling apart, cracks in the world order are emerging, and we have at our fingertips these extraordinarily generative tools to try to build new businesses and build new companies and societies and new ways of doing things. And people are excited. Talk to an 18-year-old\u2014Gideon Lichfield: That's so interesting that they are seeing the opportunity and the excitement in this. That kind of gives me hope as well.\nNoah Raford: Absolutely. Talk to a 14-year-old Indian kid about this in Bangalore, they are losing their mind with the potential for this. It's incredible. Talk to \u2026 I was having a conversation with a Ghanaian friend recently, and the potential for AI and all the tools which represent that kinda larger space has for basically dysfunctional failed states and second-order semi-functional states, which is most of the world in some argument, is absolutely huge. And so really, there shouldn't be a sort of sense of privilege guilt around talking about this stuff 'cause we're not the only ones talking about it. And in fact, we're probably the ones who are most modestly using this. There's a lot of weird experiments going on in the shadows that are gonna define what tomorrow looks like.\nGideon Lichfield: So Dubai has been home for you for \u2026\nNoah Raford: That's 13, 14 years.\nGideon Lichfield: Right. And you spent a lot of that period working as the chief futurist for the government of Dubai. And Dubai is a place that makes some people in the West kind of uncomfortable. It's not a democratic government. It's kind of not an egalitarian place, very advanced in things like surveillance tech. Why did you spend so long there and what did you learn from it? What is \u2026 Why is Dubai so important to you? \nNoah Raford: It's such a good question, 'cause Dubai is one of those things which means so many different things to so many different people, depending on the eyes through which you look at it. And I think that it's quite typical, certainly, if you've never been there, if you just read about it in the press, particularly if you grew up in the West, Western Europe, UK, France, the United States, that you get a particularly filtered version of this. When I first moved there, working in the prime minister's office, the thing that was just so profoundly shocking and surprising and invigorating to me was that it was, like I say, it was globalization with the wool pulled off your eyes. It was this huge transit hub of ideas, of people, of attitudes, of beliefs, of goods, of services from literally almost every country in the world living together, working together, trading together, without the pretense and the intermediation that we normally experience each other through. Most of us don't spend a lot of time in India or China, or North Africa, or Russia, or Ukraine, or even other states in America. And so in that sense, it gives you this extraordinary vantage point to see how \u2026 Literally, I'll give you an example, one of the things which I gained a tiny degree of notoriety for in my job was like I predicted Covid early. And it's not because I'm really smart or I had some vast surveillance apparatus around me or something of that nature. It's because I live in Dubai and there's two-thirds of the world's population within an eight-hour flight there, and almost all economic activity in the region comes through Dubai. I have lots of friends in Singapore. I have lots of friends in China. I have lots of friends in India. And I'm in touch with them on a relatively frequent basis. So when things started unfolding in Wuhan and in China with Covid in end of December, beginning of January, it didn't take a genius to figure out how many flights a day are there between China and the UAE, and to think that this is something which could really break.Gideon Lichfield: Right, and that's something that you could just see from where you sat, basically.\nNoah Raford: Precisely. Precisely. And so I think that's what so extraordinary about Dubai is it really is a city of the future in the sense that because it is the epicenter of all of these different threads of human civilization and of economy and politics and ideology and belief and culture, everything is kind of there.\nGideon Lichfield: Do you think \u2026 Would you argue that Dubai is actually doing a better job of developing this technology in a way that is attentive to ethics and to social needs? \nNoah Raford: Yeah, absolutely, I absolutely would. I think there's a dozen examples. We could take cryptocurrency and blockchain as an example. Early on, we started working in that space in 2014. We created an industry in a civil society group called the Dubai Global Blockchain Council in 2014 that had all the big banks, all the big regulators, all the big tech companies, a bunch of the most interesting startups at the time, as well as a bunch of academics and entrepreneurs in it. And what do we do? We just first started talking about it. \"What do we mean by this? What is this thing?\" This was a big collaborative civil society effort and we did a bunch of public events, started having conversations in the media about it, building a dialogue around this in the public sphere. And then after kind of coming up with some understanding of what the risks and the opportunities were, each of the people in the organization and the industry association started to do experiments and prototypes, proof of concepts, \"What does it mean for a bank? What does it mean for a logistics company? What does it mean for a car company? What does it mean for education certification and degrees, and for the health care authority?\" And by doing these little experiments, we're able to do several things at once, which was first remove the emotional terror from the novelty of this new way of doing things, which is the biggest barrier to change, and second, provide strong coalitions of people who supported it in the industry, who had skin in the game and who are willing to test it out, that led to not only the legalization of crypto in 2016, but also a very ambitious strategy to implement cryptocurrency technologies in all of the public sector applications. And I think that's a \u2026 I think what \u2026 The US is still arguing over how to regulate this stuff.\nGideon Lichfield: What's been your best call and your worst call about the future? \nNoah Raford: I think Covid was a great call. Called that early. I stopped going to work two months before it became a commonly accepted thing. When I had to go into work, I was wearing masks and everyone was yelling at me like, \"You're freaking people out. Why are you doing this? [chuckle] Stop this. Our staff is getting scared. We don't have an official statement out yet.\" But I said, \"No, this is a big deal, this is coming.\" And in fact, my Covid escape story was like a scene from the movie Children of Men. I escaped Dubai two days before the border closed. I arrived in the UK to pick up my kids and family, managed to convince them in a 48-hour period that this was a really big deal. We rented a car, drove through the channel to France two hours before the borders closed, found a place to stay two hours before the national lockdown in France occurred and spent four months in an organic pig farm in Provence, and it was awesome.Gideon Lichfield: That's sounds like a good call.\nNoah Raford: It was awesome. So that was definitely probably my shining moment as an applied futurist there.\nGideon Lichfield: And as a father.\nNoah Raford: And as a father, yeah. So that was the moment where all those years of conversation of like, \"We might be refugees, guys. Things might change in really surprising and traumatic ways really fast.\" All that stuff paid off.\nGideon Lichfield: And what was your worst call? \nNoah Raford: What was my worst call? I'd have to say self-driving cars.\nGideon Lichfield: What did you say about them? \nNoah Raford: Well, I was big on \u2026 I was big on autonomous transport quite early, part of my background as an urban planner. And I took one of the first delegations of all senior Dubai government officials to San Francisco back in 2014 or so, 2014, '15. We visited Google X before it was Waymo, and a lot of these self-driving car companies then. And it looked to me that the development curve of AI and computer vision and autonomy was gonna yield pretty dramatic changes in the mobility space over the next five, 10 years. And when you're talking about road-building programs, that means you have to start changing the way you're doing things now. So, we went really big on self-driving cars and autonomous transport and developed a big autonomous transport strategy, and just the industry hasn't really gotten there.\nGideon Lichfield: What keeps you up at night? \nNoah Raford: Well, we certainly have not seen the last pandemic, that's for sure. I was reading a study the other day by Development Institute. They were estimating something like a 25 percent chance of another corona-scale pandemic within the next 10 years and a 50 percent chance within the next 20 years. That's just one of those things that is so far beyond our control that we have really not prepared for, that would really, really ruin a lot of people's days. So I'm really worried about that. I'm still worried about uncontrolled nuclear releases, I'm really worried \u2026 Actually, speaking about the pandemic thing, I'm really worried, a lot of the evidence I'm seeing coming out of the Siberian Tundra that's thawing, there's all sorts of unbelievably nasty viruses from 15,000 years ago, like new strains of anthrax and stuff which have been lying dormant in the Siberian Tundra, which are just gonna get released over the next decade or two. And we have\u2014\nGideon Lichfield: You started talking about the tundra and I thought you're gonna say methane.\nNoah Raford: I wish. I wish methane was \u2026 Methane's a long, slow problem for us. But we are likely to face some emerging infectious disease or virus coming out of melted tundra in Siberia sooner rather than later, and we have no idea what that looks like. And all the biologists which I've been reading around the space are pretty freaking terrified about it.Gideon Lichfield: Okay. And then finally, what gives you cause for optimism? \nNoah Raford: I mean, it's exciting, right? It's exciting. I just started my own company, an AI company, which is super exciting to be able to have really the power of billions of dollars of computational data analysis in your hands for pennies, and to be able to build niche services around that, build really valuable companies around little niches that serve a specific audience really, really well. It's so exciting. There's so many life-changing amounts of money and life-changing businesses that are going to be made in the next two, three years around AI by itself, that it should give people hope. It should give people some immediate day-to-day sense of encouragement and enthusiasm that we can actually do something that is definitely gonna change our lives and our family's lives, if not \"save the world.\" But as a whole, so many people are experimenting in these spaces, be it from biotech to new financial services, to new applications of AI, that it's just deeply exciting.\nGideon Lichfield: Noah, you are one of the people that I know that most lives in the future. And I'm gonna sign off by telling you to have a nice future because I'm pretty sure you're gonna have one.\nNoah Raford: Let's have a nice future together.\nGideon Lichfield: Thank you, Noah.\nNoah Raford: Thanks, Gideon.\n[Break]\nGideon Lichfield: So, how did that make you feel, Lauren? \nLauren Goode: Well, let me just say, I would love to be a fly on the wall during one of Noah Raford's dinner conversations with his kids.\nGideon Lichfield: Right, the ones where he says, \"You're gonna be refugees.\"\nLauren Goode: Yes, every six months or so, just call for the family meeting and say, \"Kids, we're preparing for the worst.\" I can't tell whether that instills unnecessary fear in future generations, or whether that's actually the smart thing to do. It seems like it's a pretty smart thing to do.\nGideon Lichfield: Seems like it's a smart thing to do to me. I mean, we're afraid of... We can't imagine conversations like that because we're precisely afraid of that possibility. Can you imagine becoming a refugee? But people have grown up in all sorts of different times of history with all kinds of different expectations about what the future is, or even the concept of the future. So, I feel like if you get people used to the fact that it's going to look or could look a certain way, then maybe it's a lot less traumatic when it finally happens.\nLauren Goode: Right. And it made me think also based on what he said about pandemics, that maybe we should be having those conversations once every three to six months among ourselves to say, \"How are we going to handle it if or when the next pandemic happens?\"Gideon Lichfield: Right. It's almost like being preppers in the US, people who are just expecting the worst and are ready for it to happen. It's easy to laugh at them, but then there is something about that feeling of being \u2026 Feeling ready, feeling secure, that even if the worst happens, you can handle it. I think that might be psychologically helpful to a lot of people, especially in the world we're going into.\nLauren Goode: The second thing that came to mind was, I wasn't sure what to make of his approach to thinking about climate change and I wanted to hear your thoughts on this. Because on the one hand, he's saying we should do small things in order to feel a sense of agency, but on the other hand, he basically says that what we do does not matter. We could recycle all the stuff we're supposed to recycle, we could bike to work as I've started doing and it just doesn't matter. That was a little bit depressing to hear because this recent IPCC report makes it clear just how dire things are and that we really need swift, wide-scale reduction in the use of fossil fuels if we're going to avoid reaching catastrophic global temperatures. And yet, Noah is saying it doesn't matter. Everything we do doesn't matter.\nGideon Lichfield: I mean, I think \u2026\nLauren Goode: How did you square this? \nGideon Lichfield: I think \u2026 The way I took it was he was saying, yes, individual actions like biking to work one day or recycling this bottle are not going to make a difference, but I think if we are doing these things, taking responsibility for the way our actions might impact the climate, then two things happen: One, you get a sense of agency that I think is just a good for your mental well-being and two, you become part of this fabric of people who are taking these actions, thinking about these things and making the question of climate more central in their lives just by virtue of action. And I think it influences the decisions that we make around which politicians we support, or which campaigns we support, or which companies we buy from. And those decisions ultimately influence the people whose decisions do matter because those are the big policy and commercial decisions that ultimately change the course of what fuels we use or what energy gets expended.\nLauren Goode: Here's the other thing that you guys talked about that really stood out to me: AI. And I thought he really helped put this in perspective for me, because we as journalists are a little bit alarmed right now by the release of generative AI, and I think we should be, but Noah also brought up a fair point about how there may be a 14-year-old kid in another part of the world, and he mentions Bangalore specifically, that is seeing generative AI as a tool or as an opportunity, and that some of the technological developments of the past 20 years may have left large portions of the population behind and this is a chance for people to actually sort of get on \u2026 on even ground. At the same time, I'm not entirely convinced that generative AI will be any different from those advancements because we're already seeing how it's being released within a sort of capitalistic structure and how we, people, are being used as inputs for the training data. What did you make of that? Gideon Lichfield: Of course, there are going to be the 14-year-olds in Bangalore who will be able to have opportunities they wouldn't have had otherwise because of generative AI. For me, there's always this quote that sticks in my mind from Zeynep Tufekci, who's a sociologist of technology, and a piece that she wrote that I commissioned, and it is, \"Power always learns and powerful tools always fall into its hands.\" And the point that she's making is the structural political economic power arrangements that exist tend to reassert themselves, and they are slower to catch up to new technologies, but they ultimately do catch up. So I am skeptical that these tools are gonna fundamentally create a more level playing field. They will give opportunities to some.\nLauren Goode: Say a little bit more about that.\nGideon Lichfield: I mean that we will see the kid from Bangalore become the leader of a multibillion-dollar company, and in fact, that's already happened with some of the top companies in the US. But those power structures that they come into are existing power structures. So is India going to overtake the US because of generative AI? No. Is India gonna overtake the US for other reasons? Possibly. But I don't think technology is the driving force here. It's demographic questions, it's economic questions, it's geopolitical questions that are driving who ultimately ends up on top.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, and especially since these generative AI tools are coming from these capitalistic enterprises, there are roots in academic research, but right now it's kind of a race among these companies, these tech companies, to just put things out into the world and best each other.\nGideon Lichfield: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: That doesn't seem to bode super well for us as humans. We're all humans, but that doesn't seem to bode super well for us as the average tech consumers.\nGideon Lichfield: One of the things that for me was interesting was how he talked about the UAE as this transit hub for people all over the world. I think a lot about the future of government and democracy, and one of the things that's clear is that the notion that I grew up with, that liberal democracy is just gonna take over the entire world, that's not going to happen. And what Noah was hinting at for me was a future in which there are many different kinds of government systems around the world and it's not necessarily \u2026 Obviously, the democracies are the ones that are best at serving their citizens or at keeping up with the pace of technological development and how to regulate it. I think he described how he felt like Dubai is much more on top of the pace of technological change and how to keep it doing the best things for its society. So I feel like that's an uncomfortable position for us in the western world because we grew up with this notion that our political system is necessarily going to yield the best results, the most equal results for everybody. And Noah got me thinking a lot about just how true or untrue that is.Lauren Goode: How hopeful did you feel walking away from your conversation with him? \nGideon Lichfield: I felt more hopeful simply because I saw from him that there is a way to think about the future that doesn't require you to feel like you have to be able to predict the future. It's more about a mindset of preparedness for it. Now, sure, I think that also comes with a certain amount of privilege that someone like Noah has, or someone like you or I have, that we're in a good position to be able to capitalize on wherever the future is going and be prepared for it. That isn't true for everyone. But at least it gave me some reassurance that you don't have to know where things are going in order to survive them.\nLauren Goode: So it's not like he told you we're going to have a nice future, but he told you we can at least be prepared for a not nice future? \nGideon Lichfield: Umm, yeah.\nLauren Goode: That's our show for today. Thanks for listening. Have a Nice Future is hosted by me, Lauren Goode.\nGideon Lichfield: And me, Gideon Lichfield. \nLauren Goode: If you like the show, you can leave us a review wherever you get your podcasts, and follow us to hear more episodes. \nGideon Lichfield: Have a Nice Future is a production of Condé Nast Entertainment. Danielle Hewitt and Lena Richards from Prologue Projects produce the show.\nLauren: See you back here next Wednesday.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY GIDEON LICHFIELD","title":"Noah Raford Can Help You Prepare for a Not-So-Nice Future","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/have-a-nice-future-podcast-3\/","tags":["","HAVE A NICE FUTURE","PODCASTS","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","CLIMATE CHANGE","COVID-19","CITIES","POLICY","PARENTING"]},{"date":"04.25.2023","summary":"The government wants the metaverse to be less about having fun and shopping and more about health care and industry.","post_content":"BEFORE COVID-19 SHUT down Guangzhou, authorities in the province in China\u2019s subtropical south were preoccupied with another virus: dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that causes chills and muscle pains.

In 2009, the Lagos state government declared a 150-square-kilometer patch of land along the Gulf of Guinea coast \u201Cthe Lekki Free Zone,\u201D offering tax holidays and other perks for companies who set up there.\n\u201CThe moment you are inside the zone, you are outside of the Nigerian state,\u201D says Omolade Adunbi, professor of Afro-American and African studies at the University of Michigan and author of Enclaves of Exception: Special Economic Zones and Extractive Practices in Nigeria. The rationale for the zone was simple: entice international businesses to establish a thriving industrial hub, and watch the newly created capital flow outward to the rest of the economy.\nSo far, the projects in the free zone have been industrial, with an oil refinery, garment factories, and other manufacturing facilities looming over the scrubland. But a new project has its ambitions first and foremost in the cloud: a virtual startup city that will transform into a physical one when it lays its first bricks later this year.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nSpearheaded by one of Nigeria\u2019s most successful tech entrepreneurs, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, and real estate entrepreneur Luqman Edu, Itana is an aspiring tech hub that promises to host Nigeria\u2019s internet workers and help nurture a new generation of tech unicorns. Taking advantage of the Lekki Free Zone\u2019s preexisting tax breaks to appeal to itinerant entrepreneurs, the founders envision the completed city as somewhere between the glittering spires of Dubai and Delaware, the small US state that is the registered home of more than 1.5 million companies from all over the world.\nThe project\u2019s investors include stalwarts of a controversial movement to build privately-owned city-states around the world, including Pronomos Capital, a venture fund backed by libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel; it\u2019s also working with the Charter Cities Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for quasi-independent, pro-business zones to be established in developing countries. It already has its first high-profile partner in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, which has agreed to help establish a blockchain-based financial ecosystem in the new city\u2014in a country that has heavily regulated crypto trading.\nItana has ambitions to become Africa\u2019s Silicon Valley. But historically, private city projects and special economic zones on the continent have struggled to become the beacons of prosperity they were initially pitched as. Critics of such endeavours say they don\u2019t contribute to society at large, but simply create havens for the wealthy, and risk exacerbating the economic inequality that has long driven conflict in Nigeria. The ideology underpinning low-tax, pro-business enclaves that exist on the periphery of the nation-state is \u201Cantithetical to the progress of Africa,\u201D Adunbi says.\nThe impetus behind Itana (formerly known as Talent City) comes from a sense of Nigeria\u2019s unfulfilled potential, according to Aboyeji, who has cofounded two unicorns\u2014private companies worth more than $1 billion. But while both\u2014talent marketplace Andela and payments company Flutterwave\u2014are considered Nigerian companies, they, along with fellow local unicorn Paystack, are all registered in Delaware, mostly due to the expectations of their international investors.Nigerian companies pulled in close to $1 billion in VC funding in 2022, but tech startups still struggle with a lack of basic infrastructure, and with an ongoing brain drain of educated professionals out of the country. Regulation is unpredictable, and the government has at times adopted an oppositional stance to the sector, at one point effectively banning cryptocurrencies and blocking Twitter after protests in 2021.\n\u201CI remember bringing a piece of paper and writing down what we felt were the three fundamental pillars that needed to be solved to create the ideal environment for tech in Africa,\u201D says Edu of his and Aboyeji\u2019s first discussion about Itana. They decided on governance, infrastructure, and community. \u201CIt makes sense to create this well-designed policy environment that would make investors feel more comfortable investing in Africa, and [allow] tech companies in Africa to be able to scale globally,\u201D Edu says.\nIn practice, that begins with establishing a digital free zone, where companies signing up for digital residency would be able to benefit from bespoke rules around tax, company registration, immigration, the legal system, and offshore banking. Following the digital zone will be a physical city based in an urban development project in the Lekki Free Zone called Alaro City, a private-public partnership between the Lagos State Government and Rendeavour, an Africa-focused development company whose shareholders are from the United States, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom.\nItana\u2019s website displays photographs of the marshy plot where construction is due to start, juxtaposed with artistic renderings of what the tech hub should one day look like: a verdant business park which features snaking grass-covered walkways and sunlit decks housing breakout groups. The first stage of construction aims to house 3,000 to 5,000 people, and will cost up to $500 million, Edu says. Itana has recently closed a $2 million pre-seed funding round to build the digital free zone, from VCs including Local Globe, Amplo, Pronomos, and Aboyeji\u2019s fund Future Africa.\nThe founders say they have already secured 7 hectares in Alaro City for the physical district (at a value of $12.5 million), and are also close to finalizing a separate special purpose vehicle for further financing and development. Edu adds the project has had an expression of interest from the Africa Finance Corporation, a development finance organization, for investment of $50 million for the first phase.\nAt present, Itana has around 2,000 digital members and 200 digital residents. While members can take part in the community\u2019s activities, digital residents pay a $100 annual subscription fee to be given preferential consideration on securing a space in the city, the ability to incorporate their businesses in the digital free zone, and access to the physical districts. Edu says he envisions Itana in Nigeria as just the first of a string of hubs across the continent forming \u201Ca decentralized Silicon Valley, with districts all across Africa.\u201D\nItana is collaborating with the Charter Cities Institute, a group set up to evangelize the charter city concept originally conceived by the famous economist Paul Romer. Romer\u2019s idea was to set up self-governing jurisdictions in struggling countries that would be controlled by more developed countries, importing ready-made laws and institutional oversight. The success of the autonomous zone would theoretically present a positive example to the rest of the country and create an economic halo effect. One of Itana\u2019s backers, Pronomos Capital, is a venture firm also dedicated to setting up charter cities. It\u2019s headed up by Patri Friedman, Milton Friedman\u2019s grandson, the libertarian founder of the Seasteading Institute. The country that has come closest to experimenting with the idea so far is Honduras, where companies (rather than countries, as in Romer\u2019s initial conception) bought pieces of land that were styled as city-states and established their own legal frameworks and governance systems. But the Honduran government recently voted against the laws and constitutional amendment permitting charter cities, meaning the future of the fledgling projects is now on shaky ground.\nWhile Itana\u2019s founders have said it is not aiming for anything as radical as this, and that they are working with, rather than outside, Nigeria\u2019s government, the Charter Cities Institute \u201Cshare similar goals as to what we're trying to do,\u201D says Coco Liu, chief operating officer of Itana. \u201CTheir idea is ideal governance, and they've identified \u2026 special economic zones as the best way to enable foreign direct investment.\u201D\nItana isn\u2019t using the charter city label, which can be controversial. In September 2020, a viral Twitter thread from an American, Dryden Wilson Tate Brown, announced his intention to establish a new city in West Africa with his startup Bluebook Cities, saying that he had met with high-level officials in Nigeria and Ghana to discuss a project.\nCritics quickly piled in on Twitter, with many denouncing the idea as white saviorism, and saying it smacked of neocolonialism mixed with a dash of Fyre Festival. Pronomos Capital was reportedly one of the backers of Bluebook Cities (which seems to no longer exist).\nPronomos Capital didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nKurtis Lockhart, executive director at CCI, rejects any such suggestions about the institute\u2019s work in Africa. \u201CColonialism implies that the threat of violence, coercion, and\/or political control is present, either at the barrel of a gun or, perhaps more commonly today, a debt trap,\u201D he says. \u201CCharter cities invite neither.\u201D\nNigeria is not the only place CCI is making headway with its charter city ambitions. The organization is also working closely with Zambia\u2019s government on setting up charter cities projects, and signed a recent memorandum of understanding with Rwanda\u2019s government to establish cooperation on city-building plans.\nCharter cities and projects like them are increasingly tech-focused\u2014perhaps reflecting the strain of libertarianism that runs through the US tech sector, with investors like Thiel long enthralled by the anarcho-capitalist dream of communities free from the interference of big government. The crypto sector, whose adherents are often similarly hostile to state oversight, is heavily involved in nascent projects like El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin City, Honduras\u2019 Prospera, and Senegal\u2019s Akon City.\n\u201CThe tech sector has long been supportive of charter cities, and many of the most exciting charter city projects in development are focused on generating more productive hubs for innovation in Africa,\u201D says Lockhart, adding that CCI was first introduced to Aboyeji through its connections with the tech sector.\nThe details of Itana\u2019s partnership with Binance haven\u2019t been revealed, but Edu says that the city will have a whole committee of blockchain and crypto stakeholders, who will advise on policies regarding what role crypto might play in the virtual free zone.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY LAURIE CLARKE","title":"A Peter Thiel-Backed Startup City Wants to Be Africa\u2019s Delaware","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/itana-binance-charter-cities-institute-africa-tech-startup\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","CITIES","BLOCKCHAIN","FINANCE","STARTUPS","AFRICA"]},{"date":"04.10.2023","summary":"Ether is finally untethering itself from mining\u2014and driving renewed debate about bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact.","post_content":"AT 19:27 EASTERN time on April 12, the Ethereum blockchain, home to the world\u2019s second-most-popular cryptocurrency, ether, will finally sever its links to crypto mining. Within the Ethereum bubble, a sense of anticipation is building; some are planning \u201Cviewing parties\u201D for the occasion. Codenamed \u201CShanghai,\u201D the update to Ethereum caps off a process, after \u201CThe Merge,\u201D which fundamentally changes the way transactions are verified and the network secured. \nUnder the old system, proof-of-work (PoW) mining, the right to process a batch of transactions and earn a crypto reward is determined by a race to solve a mathematical puzzle. The greater the computing power miners throw at the problem, the greater their chance of winning the race. Under Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake (PoS) system, there is no race and there are no miners; instead, the winner is determined by raffle. The greater the amount of ether somebody locks up on the network\u2014or stakes\u2014the greater the chance they hold a prize-winning ticket.\nBy demonstrating that a large-scale blockchain can shift from one system to another, Shanghai will reignite a debate over whether the practice of mining that still supports bitcoin, the most widely traded cryptocurrency, is viable and sustainable. Figures from the University of Cambridge suggest the Bitcoin network consumed 107 terawatt-hours of energy in 2022\u2014equivalent to that of the Netherlands\u2014of which only just over a quarter came from renewable sources. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum consumed roughly two-thirds as much energy as the Bitcoin network. But the move away from mining has cut that consumption, according to analysis by Alex de Vries, data scientist at De Nederlandsche Bank and creator of Digiconomist, a source of crypto emissions data, by at least 99.84 percent.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\n\u201CThe energy consumption problem is Bitcoin\u2019s achilles heel,\u201D says de Vries. \u201CIt\u2019s a simple fact that as the price of bitcoin gets higher, the energy consumption problem gets worse. The more money miners make, the more they will typically spend on resources: hardware and electricity.\nBut many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And, they say, PoS is inferior to PoW\u2014prone to centralization (crypto\u2019s great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces, like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of crypto.\nIn bitcoin\u2019s infancy, the cryptocurrency could be mined effectively with just a personal computer and simple software. But as the level of appetite for bitcoin increased, the industry professionalized. Today, the mining scene is dominated by large companies\u2014some publicly traded, like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain\u2014that operate gargantuan facilities with rack upon rack of hardware. The largest of these mines, many of which are located in Texas, can draw upwards of 700 MW of power.But bitcoin proponents claim that looking at the absolute amount of energy that the industry consumes misses important context. Far from triggering investment in new fossil-fuel plants, miners say they are incentivizing renewable energy development, by plugging the gaps when demand is low.\n\u201COnly the miners with the cheapest energy can survive, so bitcoin is driven to areas of low or no demand,\u201D says Yan Pritzker, cofounder of the bitcoin trading platform Swan Bitcoin. \u201CSources of wind and solar are unreliable and therefore have to be overprovisioned. But bitcoin miners are coming in and acting as a buyer of last resort.\u201D\nBy purchasing energy from renewable sources when it isn\u2019t needed by the grid, the argument goes, bitcoin miners can increase the profitability of solar and wind farms and accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources. Miners also say consumption figures like those compiled by the University of Cambridge don\u2019t take into account the amount of off-grid energy sources used to power mining, nor the circa 1 percent that run on methane\u2014a byproduct of oil extraction that is otherwise vented or burned away.\nA common argument among bitcoiners is that rather than focusing on trying to cut down how much energy is consumed by the network, critics should look at how the network can help expand the amount of renewable energy on the grid. \u201CBitcoiners understand that the way to reduce emissions is not to use less energy, but to generate orders of magnitude more low-emissions electricity,\u201D says Chris Bendiksen, bitcoin research lead at investment firm CoinShares. \u201CIn order to do that, producing low-emission energy must be profitable, something that PoW mining ensures in a wholly unique manner and at scale.\u201D\nAlthough compelling at a surface level, these arguments do not stand up to scrutiny, say bitcoin critics. Pete Howson, an assistant professor on the Environmental Sciences faculty at Northumbria University, likens the common defenses of bitcoin mining to \u201Cmagic tricks''\u2014sleights of hand that obscure inconvenient truths and \u201Cprovide the illusion of clean and profitable investment.\u201D\n\u201CThe only difference between flaring methane and flaring methane for bitcoin,\u201D says Howson, \u201Cis that the latter makes fossil-fuel companies more profitable, slowing the transition to green alternatives.\u201D There are even a handful of examples\u2014in New York and Montana\u2014of the additional revenue generated by bitcoin mining giving new life to fossil-fuel plants that had either closed or were scheduled for closure.\nMeanwhile, in countries like Iceland, Howson says, bitcoin miners are outcompeting other energy consumers, like recycling plants, which \u201Ccan\u2019t get access\u201D to otherwise plentiful sources of renewable energy. \u201CThere is no such thing as wasting energy sustainably,\u201D he says.\nWhether it\u2019s really a waste is at the core of the debate.\nThe scrutiny of bitcoin\u2019s environmental credentials, says Pritzker, is out of proportion with the emissions it produces, which best estimates place somewhere between 0.1 percent to 0.15 percent of the global total. He asks why bitcoin is singled out, when other industries pollute in larger volumes or are powered by a dirtier mix of energy. The simple answer is that the argument hinges on a matter of personal opinion; it comes down to whether somebody believes that crypto serves a purpose.If bitcoin is agreed to be of greater societal value than tobacco, say, an industry responsible for a greater volume of emissions, its footprint becomes easier to justify. But if instead, bitcoin is just one big Ponzi scheme, the sums will never line up.\nThis ideological battle, and the strength of the animosity between bitcoin evangelists and their critics, means that it\u2019s hard to have a nuanced discussion about the industry, and both sides have become entrenched in their positions.\nAccording to de Vries, it would be perfectly possible, from a technical perspective, for Bitcoin to follow in the footsteps of the Ethereum network. \u201CBitcoin could move to PoS, no problem,\u201D he says. \u201CBut it\u2019s a social challenge.\u201D\nDe Vries is often attacked by bitcoiners, who claim he is incentivized by his affiliation with central banking to criticize bitcoin, that his data is incorrect, and that he fails to account for the nuances in bitcoin\u2019s relationship with the environment.\nBitcoiners have locked horns with environmental charities. On March 23, activists at Greenpeace unveiled an art installation named the Skull of Satoshi, an allusion to the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Standing 11 feet tall, the skull is decorated with old motherboards, its eye sockets glow red, and chimneys eject smoke from the crown. The installation was intended to represent the dual contribution of crypto mining to carbon emissions and e-waste, says Rolf Skar, campaign director at Greenpeace USA. But the skull was quickly appropriated by bitcoin supporters on Twitter, who described the skull as \u201Cmetal\u201D and \u201Cbadass.\u201D Some used it as a new profile picture. \n\u201CThe reaction was predictable, but disappointing,\u201D says Skar. \u201CIt\u2019s not surprising, but it\u2019s a bad look to trivialize these very real issues.\u201D\nThe artist that designed the sculpture, Benjamin Von Wong, bore some of the backlash too. On March 25, he published a Twitter thread saying that he had revised his \u201Cblack and white\u201D assessment after conversations with bitcoiners. But he also pointed to the forces standing in the way of productive debate: \u201CThere are people on both sides who believe the other is naively optimistic, misguided and misinformed,\u201D he wrote.\nThe Skull of Satoshi, which is being taken on a tour of US cities, is part of a broader Greenpeace campaign called \u201CChange the Code, Not the Climate,\u201D the purpose of which is to push for changes in the Bitcoin code base that would reduce the network\u2019s emissions. Skar says the intention is to prevent fossil-fuel plants from \u201Croaring back to life,\u201D courtesy of bitcoin, but Bendiksen calls the effort a \u201Csmear campaign.\u201D\nBoth parties also accuse the other of bad-faith misrepresentations of facts and data. The Greenpeace campaign, Pritzker and Bendiksen say, is funded in part by Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple, a company with interests in promoting XRP, a cryptocurrency that was launched as a direct competitor to bitcoin. But by the same token, says Howson, arguments in favor of bitcoin mining are often founded on data supplied by the Bitcoin Mining Council, a coalition of mining companies led by Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, a business with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in bitcoin.The impasse is worsened by the ideological opposition to PoS among bitcoiners, separate from the environmental considerations. Some find unthinkable the idea of tampering with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original invention, and others, like Bendiksen and Pritzker, believe PoS introduces greater risk of centralization and censorship\u2014and therefore represents a threat to crypto\u2019s founding principles. \u201CPoS is essentially the fiat system,\u201D says Pritzker, \u201Cbecause whoever has the gold makes the rules.\u201D For this reason, explains Bendiksen, bitcoiners will \u201Cnever agree\u201D to a shift.\n\u201CAny attack on bitcoin is an attack on their morality, values, and often their net worth. This makes everything feel personal,\u201D Von Wong told WIRED. \u201CBecause most people don\u2019t see themselves as intrinsically bad, they feel misjudged and misunderstood, which is a terrible place to start a conversation.\u201D\nThe result is a situation in which both parties lob insults across the void but register none of the legitimate or well-intentioned complaints. Any morsel of information that might be used to discredit the opposition is also seized upon. And Von Wong worries about becoming a morsel himself.\n\u201CThe hardest part about being in the center of a controversy is feeling like a chess piece,\u201D he says. \u201CI don\u2019t feel like I can speak freely in public without someone, somewhere, taking what I say out of context and trying to leverage it against the opposite side.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Update Opens a Rift in Crypto","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ethereum-shanghai-update-crypto-rift\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","ETHEREUM","ENVIRONMENT"]},{"date":"04.09.2023","summary":"After rising from the dead, the theater subscription service is back with a convoluted new business model. Here\u2019s how it works and how to sign up.","post_content":"MOVIEPASS, THE BELEAGUERED startup that aimed to revolutionize seeing movies at the theater (and sort of did, indirectly) is back. After bankruptcy, a pandemic that shut down movie theaters anyway, and an acquisition, it's taking another crack at the subscription model. Here's what we know about MoviePass 2.0.\nWhat Happened to the Old MoviePass?\nIn case you're not up to speed, here's the short version: For several years, MoviePass offered a simple subscription for watching movies in theaters. The company experimented with different models, such as $15\/month for a couple of movies, or $40 to $50 per month for unlimited movies. \nThen, in 2018, the company made a bold, absurd change: up to a movie every day for $10 a month. In many parts of the country, that's less than the price of a single movie ticket. And MoviePass was paying full price to theaters for every ticket. Millions of users signed up, and why wouldn't they? It was essentially free money from MoviePass.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nMeet the Guy Making Horror Movie Masks for 40 Years\nThe plan didn't go well. Over time, MoviePass had to raise prices, customer support started languishing, and the company's alternative plans to generate revenue fell through. Worse (for MoviePass, but great for us), theater chains themselves started offering their own subscriptions. \nThese were more financially viable, since theaters pay less to studios for tickets than MoviePass paid to theaters. Plus, even if theaters took a loss on ticket sales, they would still benefit from increased concessions revenue. (At one point, in an attempt to bring in revenue, MoviePass argued that it should get a cut of theaters' concessions sales. This also didn't go well.)\nEventually MoviePass went into bankruptcy, and one of the company's cofounders, Stacy Spikes, bought back the company. Why is all this history relevant? Well, if you're planning to sign up, it's worth keeping in mind that this is yet another in a long line of attempted business models. It remains to be seen whether this one will work out.\nHow Do I Sign Up for MoviePass?\nThe current iteration of MoviePass (dubbed MoviePass Beta) is rolling out in stages\u2014presumably to help mitigate a similar rush-and-crash that its predecessor experienced, which is certainly a risk factor, since the waitlist itself crashed the minute it went live). On August 25, 2022, the company opened up a waitlist for five days. \nIf you signed up for the waitlist during that window, you're in line to get an invite to the new MoviePass. Once you're in, you'll get a cache of invites that you can send to your friends. If you missed the waitlist period, finding someone with one of these invites will be your best bet until around summer 2023.\nMoviePass Beta isn't launching in all markets at once. The company says that it's gauging interest in different parts of the country based on how many people sign up for the waitlist in an area. Many major cities like Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and Austin have already gained access. Prices will also vary somewhat based on what city you're in, particularly in New York and California.There are three main price tiers at around $10, $20, and $30 per month (with a fourth $40 tier \u201Cin select markets\u201D). Rather than providing a set number of movies, these plans give you a certain number of credits. These credits can be spent on buying movie tickets, and some of your unused credits will roll over to the next month. It's a more complicated system than in the past, so let's break down how it works.\nHow Does the New MoviePass Work?\nThe details of the system were vague when the company presented its comeback plan back in February 2022. Fortunately, we've gotten into the beta and have a clearer idea of how it works. Note: I'm using the service in Austin, Texas. Some details and prices may differ depending on where you live, or if the service changes before the full public release later this summer.\nFirst, the MoviePass card is back. In black, this time, instead of the previous iconic red. Similar to the old MoviePass, you'll use this card to pay for your ticket instead of your own debit card. Unfortunately, this leads to the biggest limitations of MoviePass: You can only buy tickets in person at the theater, and only for the same day. It's not possible to buy tickets for a movie in advance.\nHowever, there are (apparently) select theaters that support e-ticketing where some of these restrictions may not apply. I wasn't able to test this, as every theater within 50 miles of me\u2014including AMC, Regal, Alamo, and several independent chains\u2014all require the card. \nYour MoviePass subscription gives you a set number of credits and, depending on the movie's showtime, it will cost a certain number of credits to purchase a ticket. Matinees (any movie before 4 pm) generally cost 10 credits, while evening movies cost 15 credits on weekdays and 20 credits on weekends. And Friday night counts as a weekend, naturally.\nThis credits system means that how many movies you can see per month depends on a number of factors. The basic $10\/month plan comes with 34 credits, for example. That's enough for three matinees, or one weekend evening movie. However, let's say you spend 20 credits on a weekend movie and have 14 left over. The next month, you'll get another 34, for a total of 48. So that month you could watch two weekend movies.\nWell. Sort of. The company's documentation is a little inconsistent during the beta. On MoviePass' FAQ page, the company says that up to two months' worth of credits will roll over. So, in this example, you could bank up to 68 credits. So you could save up some, but eventually you'll hit a use-it-or-lose-it wall.\nHowever, in my experience on the mobile app, I found different information. On one page showing the subscription options, a note says, \u201CHalf of your remaining credits are kepto [sic] to the next month if a subscription is active.\u201D In another part of the app, it tells me that all 34 of my unused credits will roll over.In other words, it's a beta. This isn't a proper review of the service, so I won't hold some inconsistencies or typos against it. But if you're going to try out the beta, it's worth keeping in mind how much the details might change over the next few months. If you were burned by the inconsistencies of MoviePass in the pass, it might be a little more stable now, but you can still expect a bit of turbulence.\nIt's also worth noting that, as of right now, the price (in credits) per ticket isn't changing based on which movie you're watching, but we can't say for certain this won't happen in the future. As of writing, it costs just as many credits to watch Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania on a Friday night as it does to watch Cocaine Bear. Even though one of those is clearly going to be more popular. Here's hoping it stays that way.\nIs Crypto Involved?\nOne of the strangest aspects of MoviePass's February 2022 presentation is that it seemed to be trying very hard not to come off as a crypto company. It touted its new vision as \u201Cpowered by Web3 technology,\u201D\u2014Web3 usually being a shorthand for blockchain- and\/or crypto-based products, two words that MoviePass was careful to steer clear of.\nDuring the presentation, MoviePass mentioned tokens that would be tradable and could roll over from month to month. This sounds like it describes the credits that roll over in the current plan, but there's no trading functionality yet. To be clear, the company hasn't discussed these features beyond that presentation, and at the time of writing the company's FAQ page doesn't mention them. However, they may eventually be part of the package, which would raise questions about how these tokens are supposed to work.\nFor example, during the presentation, the company discussed PreShow, its facial recognition, eye-tracking technology that MoviePass wants to use to show users ads. The more ads a user watches\u2013and really watches, as confirmed by PreShow\u2013the more tokens they earn. Or at least, that was the hypothetical plan laid out in February. There may be other ways that credits can be earned beyond the basic subscription in the future.\nBeyond that, there's no clear info on what Web3 would mean in this context. For now, we're in a wait-and-see formation. Nothing about MoviePass' new model sounds as obviously broken as its plan to charge users $10 for $12 movie tickets, but the success or failure of this iteration of MoviePass is going to be in the details.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ERIC RAVENSCRAFT","title":"Everything You Should Know About the New MoviePass","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/new-moviepass-features\/","tags":["","MOVIES","FILM","CULTURE","MULTIMEDIA"]},{"date":"04.06.2023","summary":"US agencies are sparring over who gets to oversee the crypto industry, and companies are stuck in the middle.","post_content":"ON MARCH 22, Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, was sent a notice by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warning that the regulator planned to sue, alleging the company had violated securities laws. Crypto assets, the SEC insists, are securities, and so fall under its jurisdiction. But on March 27, Binance, the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, and its founder Changpeng Zhao were charged by a different regulator, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with breaking commodities laws\u2014because, the CFTC says, popular crypto assets are commodities. \nThat two different exchanges can be sanctioned by two different regulators for alleged violations of entirely different regulatory regimes shows the increasing complexity of the operating environment for crypto firms in the US, as a turf war between the SEC and the CFTC escalates. After the dramatic collapse of FTX in November 2022, both regulators have adopted a more aggressive\u2014even hostile\u2014approach to the crypto industry, using enforcement actions to stake their claim to jurisdiction.\n\u201CIf people wondered what the attitude was at the beginning of the year, now they know it\u2019s hostile,\u201D says Mick Mulvaney, a former White House chief of staff and an advisor to crypto compliance platform Astra Protocol. \u201CI don\u2019t think FTX was the cause, as much as the excuse.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nSince the start of the year, the SEC has launched a flurry of cases against crypto companies and individuals in the US.  In January, the regulator charged crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital over a service that allowed US customers to earn interest on their tokens, which the agency alleged was an unregistered securities offering. In a Twitter thread, Gemini cofounder Tyler Winklevoss called the charges \u201Ca manufactured parking ticket.\u201D Neither Gemini nor Genesis responded to requests for comment.\nIn February, the regulator reached a settlement with another exchange, Kraken, which agreed to halt a service that gave US customers the ability to earn rewards for locking up their crypto. The regulator also issued crypto firm Paxos a warning of intent to sue over its BUSD stablecoin, which the SEC asserts is a security. In a statement, Paxos wrote that it \u201Ccategorically disagrees with the SEC.\u201D\nThen in March, the SEC charged Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, with market manipulation, as well as eight celebrities\u2014including the likes of Lindsay Lohan and Ne-Yo\u2014with \u201Cillegally touting\u201D Sun-related tokens without disclosing they were paid to do so. Sun did not respond to a request for comment.\nMulvaney says he thinks that the agency is \u201Cflexing its muscle\u201D with enforcement actions as a way to strengthen its claim over the industry, but in doing so, has lost its impartiality. \nEven within the SEC, there is disagreement over how the agency is handling crypto. Hester Peirce, one of five SEC commissioners, has dissented publicly against multiple crypto-related actions, in an effort, she says, to foster discussion and heal the \u201Cdysfunctional\u201D relationship between the agency and the crypto industry.\u201CWe haven\u2019t done our job as a regulator. We have not provided a road to compliance, and instead have been bringing enforcement actions after the fact,\u201D says Peirce. Even though the agency\u2019s actions are motivated by a desire to protect investors, \u201Cthe strategy is one of jurisdictional maximalization,\u201D she says. \u201CAnd one way to plant a flag is to bring enforcement action.\u201D\nSEC chair Gary Gensler's office did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe SEC\u2019s tilt at the industry has been met by a refusal at the CFTC to yield jurisdiction. The agency\u2019s lawsuit against Binance\u2014by far the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, which has until now remained largely out of reach of US regulators\u2014specifically refers to popular cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, and litecoin, as commodities.\nThe CFTC did not respond to a request for an interview, but in a statement announcing the lawsuit, Rostin Benham, CFTC chairman, set the stage for further action against crypto firms. \u201CThis should be a warning to anyone in the digital asset world that the CFTC will not tolerate willful avoidance of US law,\u201D he wrote.\nIn a blog post responding to the CFTC lawsuit, Zhao said that Binance \u201Cdoes not agree with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint.\u201D He also described the lawsuit as \u201Cdisappointing,\u201D particularly because Binance had been \u201Cworking cooperatively\u201D with the CFTC. Binance declined to provide on the record responses to further questions about the lawsuit.\nIn the absence of clear guidance from Congress as to whether the SEC or CFTC should take point on regulating the industry, crypto businesses must do what they can to anticipate possible complaints from both directions. But this is made difficult by the lack of crypto-specific guidelines from both agencies.\n\u201CIt\u2019s like driving down the road, with no signs or lanes, trying to figure out the rules based on who gets pulled over,\u201D says Dave Siemer, CEO at Los Angeles\u2013based crypto investment firm Wave Digital Assets. \u201CYou\u2019re just guessing.\u201D\nCrypto companies say they\u2019re particularly frustrated by the regulatory onslaught because they\u2019ve tried to engage with the SEC and CFTC, and asked for clearer, more comprehensive rules of the road.\nSpeaking to WIRED, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, claims his company\u2019s interactions with the SEC have been more akin to \u201Cone-sided monologues\u201D than dialogs. Attempts to help map out the parts of the crypto industry that do not fit within existing rule structures, he says, have largely garnered no response.\n\u201CCoinbase is not asking for special treatment. We want to be registered and held to strict standards,\u201D Grewal says. \u201CBut the SEC has outright refused to promulgate basic rules, instead relying on a regime of regulation by enforcement.\u201D\nGensler has called on crypto firms to register with the SEC, a process that would theoretically minimize the chances of retrospective legal action by ensuring they operate in compliance with the regulator\u2019s expectations from the get-go. But the idea that registration is as simple as filling out an online form has inflamed tensions; Grewal says this characterization of the registration process is \u201Csimply not true\u201D and that the few businesses that have tried to register have \u201Cfailed miserably.\u201DIf a business\u2019s application is rejected by the SEC, it cannot offer securities-related services in the US, at least in the form described in its application. Because of confusion over the classification of crypto assets, this eventuality could pose an \u201Cexistential threat,\u201D says Siemer. \u201CTo go in and register means to cease to exist,\u201D he says. \u201CThere is no framework; there is no path.\u201D\nThe question of what crypto is could be resolved in the courts. An ongoing case between the SEC and cross-border payments company Ripple over cryptocurrency XRP, for example, is expected to go some way to clarifying whether cryptocurrencies should be treated as securities (and be regulated by the SEC) or not. After two years, a verdict in the case is near, but because it\u2019s playing out in a district court, it will not establish binding precedent. However, a victory for the SEC would strengthen its case for becoming the de facto crypto regulator.\nPeople in the industry say that a better resolution would be for the US Congress to put in place comprehensive legislation governing crypto. The European Union is on track to introduce broad-based crypto legislation in 2024, under the Markets in Crypto Act (MiCA), and countries like Japan and the UAE have also moved quickly, but the US lags behind. A number of crypto-related bills were tabled in the 177th Congress, but died when the latest session ended in December, and so will need to be formally reintroduced and debated again.\nMulvaney, who spent six years in the House of Representatives, says it is unlikely that anything resembling comprehensive crypto legislation makes its way through Congress this year, ahead of the 2024 presidential election. But the silver lining, he says, is that crypto is \u201Cbipartisan\u201D\u2014it appeals to libertarian beliefs on both sides of the political divide\u2014which means the issue of legislation will not be settled along \u201Ctribal lines.\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s tough to operate with no regulation, because you don\u2019t know what you are,\u201D says Mulvaney. \u201CYou don\u2019t want to be over-regulated \u2026 but you need enough to give guidance and clarity. That\u2019s the sweet spot.\u201D\nIn some parts of the crypto community, the refusal of regulators to set clear lines has been interpreted as a deliberate attempt to squeeze the industry out of the US.\nIrrespective of the intention, the consequence of continued ambiguity over the classification of crypto assets, the regulator in charge, and the process of registering services with the government is likely to be an exodus of crypto businesses from the country, say Mulvaney and Siemer.\nIn late March, Circle Internet Financial, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced plans to establish a European headquarters in Paris. According to a Bloomberg report, Coinbase is also plotting an offshore version of its trading platform. Grewal declined to confirm, but says the company is \u201Cpaying careful attention to the growth of markets outside the US.\u201D\nA similar pattern is playing out among smaller crypto firms. Wave Digital Assets is preparing its own contingency plan, Siemer says. Although the company is not yet considering leaving the US, it has halted hiring in the country over concerns about the regulatory climate.\nPeirce, the SEC commissioner, says the agency\u2019s objective is to help enable safe experimentation with technology, not to push the crypto industry offshore. But she is sympathetic to the interpretation. \u201CIf you\u2019re trying to send the message that you want crypto in the United States, but you want it to be compliant, the way to send that message is to help companies [to become compliant]. But we don\u2019t see that happening,\u201D she says. \n\u201CYou don\u2019t repair the situation by saying \u2018come in and register\u2019\u2014because nobody knows what that means\u2014but by bringing everyone into a room and having a conversation like adults.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Binance and Coinbase Have Been Sucked Into a Regulatory Turf War","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/binance-coinbase-regulatory-turf-war\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","REGULATION"]},{"date":"04.01.2023","summary":"Plus: A major new supply chain attack, Biden\u2019s spyware executive order, and a hacking campaign against Exxon\u2019s critics.","post_content":"DID YOU HEAR that Donald Trump got indicted this week?

This knowledge is all thanks to the QR code on the shirt\u2019s label and hangtag.\nScanning the QR code takes them to the shirt\u2019s entry on the Aura Blockchain Consortium\u2014a blockchain that is equally owned by a who\u2019s who of luxury companies: LVMH, OTB Group, Prada, Richemont, and Mercedes-Benz. \nA Loro Piana analyst assessing the quality of some fibers.\nYou\u2019ve likely heard of the blockchain, but if you\u2019re still in the dark about what it is, a blockchain network is essentially a shared, digital ledger of transactions which, once recorded, can\u2019t be changed or tampered with\u2014although they can be viewed by anyone. Take, for example, our writer\u2019s shirt. They can claim ownership of it by using the pin code they were given on purchase, as well as see the details of how it was made and its care instructions\u2014all by scanning the QR code on the label. And if they were to try and sell it, potential buyers could verify that it\u2019s an authentic Loro Piana shirt\u2014that the seller owns\u2014by looking it up on the Aura Blockchain Consortium before its ownership is officially transferred\u2014with this transfer being recorded on the blockchain for anyone to see.\nCreated in April 2021, the Aura Blockchain Consortium was built in an effort to innovate, push sustainability (it\u2019s pledged to be carbon neutral by 2025), and give customers transparency.\nThe use of blockchain technology in luxury markets has two obvious upsides: It will be harder for scammers to try and pass off fake luxury goods as genuine items when they don\u2019t have the proper QR code. Sellers of stolen luxury goods will also have a hard time when the blockchain shows that they don\u2019t own what they\u2019re selling.For Loro Piana, the use of the blockchain is a natural next step in its technical evolution, since it\u2019s one of the few luxury fashion companies to be vertically integrated. It has grown over the years from a family of wool fabric merchants in the 19th century to the innovator it is today\u2014a company that controls its entire production process. Today, Loro Piana sources its own raw materials, manufactures them, and retails its wears, offering its customers a unique end product that has been quality controlled all the way back to the fiber it\u2019s made from.\nNot every Loro Piana item is certified via the Aura Blockchain Consortium\u2014yet. The luxury brand is rolling out the technology starting with its most exclusive offering: those made from the finest merino wool there is, The Gift of Kings®. Specifically, its Spring\/Summer 2023 The Gift of Kings® Ready to Wear collection, as well as 20 individual The Gift of Kings® pieces that will be sold at its new Palo Alto store to celebrate its launch\u2014and which come with their own exclusive NFTs created by artist Charlotte Taylor, which can only be transferred if the garment\u2019s ownership is transferred.\nProducts made with The Gift of Kings® wool fiber are highly sought after, seeing as there are just over 4,400 pounds of it produced every year by Loro Piana\u2019s local breeding partners in Australia and New Zealand. Loro Piana holds its annual Record Bale event to award one of these wool breeders the title of \u201CFinest Merino Wool in the World\u201D\u2014with the all-time record being 10.3 microns. The Gift of Kings® fibers are, on average, around 12 microns thick (our writer\u2019s shirt fibers are 12.6 microns in diameter, according to its entry on the Aura Blockchain Consortium). Compare this to the red blood cell of a human, which is 5 microns, and the average human hair, which is 80-100 microns in diameter, and you can see why it\u2019s so special\u2014and worthy of digital authentication and certification.\nThe Gift of Kings® collection being added to the Aura Blockchain Consortium is just the start for Loro Piana\u2014it plans to roll out the technology across its Excellences collections in the future. But, for now, it\u2019s exciting to see how this new technology could revolutionize the fashion industry and give customers like our writer the transparency they crave in a digital world.\n1 \/ 5\nThe shorn wool is scoured to remove any dirt or dust before being packaged and shipped to the manufacturing facilities in Italy.\nThis story was produced by WIRED Brand Lab for Loro Piana.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/640660ebb66dcce8cbc808ab\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/SS23%2520GOK%252036%2520Traceability%2520card.jpg","author":null,"title":" Loro Piana Is Shepherding the Future of Fashion Thanks to Blockchain Technology","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/loro-piana-is-shepherding-the-future-of-fashion-thanks-to-blockchain-technology\/","tags":[""]},{"date":"03.15.2023","summary":"How biometrics, hybrid solutions, and new digital credential technologies are transforming identity verification\u2014and everyday life.","post_content":"IN 2024, THE European Union (EU) is scheduled to unveil a new tool for seamless international travel\u2014the Digital Identity Wallet. The app will store personal data such as passports, driver\u2019s licenses, and banking info for quick verification when crossing the border into any of the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, and for easy access to money while abroad. \nThe platform is a response to growing demand for digital identity verification in Europe. In 2021, the EU\u2019s Digital COVID Certificate allowed citizens to easily share vaccination status via a QR code that could be printed out or displayed on a smartphone. In addition, 14 countries representing roughly 60 percent of the EU\u2019s population already have some kind of digitized national identification. The digital wallet will be the most ambitious rollout yet of a comprehensive digital ID system, combining security, compliance, and privacy safeguards for the EU\u2019s 447 million citizens.\n\u201CWe want the EU to become the first global region with a governance framework for trusted digital identities,\u201D stated a member of the European Parliament in February. \u201CThe digital wallet will become a reliable, all-in-one identity gateway that puts citizens in full control of their own data and gives them the freedom to decide exactly what information to share, with whom, and when \u2026 a new driver of civic engagement and social empowerment and a tool for an inclusive digital Europe.\u201D\nThe digital wallet is the latest, highest-profile example of a worldwide trend: the demise of passwords and the rise of digital identities. In a December 2022 study of 1,450 global consumers by Entrust\u2014a leader in secure identities, payments, and data\u2014just 6 percent stated that passwords are the most secure method of identity verification online, and more than half said they needed to reset their passwords at least once a month because they forgot them.\u201CNobody likes passwords,\u201D says Greg Wetmore, the vice president of software development at Entrust. \u201CThey\u2019re awkward, not very useful, and easy to steal.\u201D\nConsumers want digital verification methods that easily and securely share information that\u2019s relevant for each interaction, leading to growth in platforms and methods that will transform our lives in the years ahead.\n\u201CThis technology is in its early phases,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CBut there are really interesting pilot projects leading the charge, and Entrust has found that ultimately the future of identification is hybrid\u2014physical and digital.\u201D\nUnlocking the World\nMost of us already use an alternative to password authentication every day: scanning our thumbs or faces to unlock our smartphones. This is biometric technology, based on a person\u2019s unique biological characteristics, like fingerprints, facial shapes, voices, and retinas, and it\u2019s quickly becoming the default for verifying identity. These methods are more secure and convenient than passwords, and consumers prefer them. According to Entrust\u2019s survey, 74 percent of respondents said that when they\u2019re given the option between biometrics and passwords, they choose biometrics at least half the time.\nIn most places around the world, biometrics are already making air travel easier. The U.S. employs them in its Global Entry program, and in the United Kingdom travelers on Eurostar trains can use their face as both their ticket and e-passport when traveling throughout Europe. Authorities are updating the system so travelers can use biometrics upon entering the UK as well, and the EU is aiming to replace physical passports with digital verification by the end of 2023. \u201CEurope won\u2019t be stamping passports anymore,\u201D says Gord Wilson, the vice president of identity verification at Entrust. \u201CInstead, they\u2019ll capture facial images, scanning and confirming your identity, as opposed to capturing it and going through that whole process.\u201D\nUltimately, our smartphones will become our primary identity verification tool, providing access to various digital credentials, and that means biometrics will likely be the key to unlocking access. In addition, due to their widespread use, smartphones with biometric verification could help provide IDs for the one billion people who currently don\u2019t have a legal identity\u2014opening up ways for citizens to start bank accounts, vote, get access to healthcare and more.\n\u201CThat\u2019s a huge gap that needs to close, and I think governments have a role to play,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CMobile phones are everywhere in less developed countries and can become a great enabler, bringing more people online.\u201D\nElectronic IDs and Hybrid Solutions Provide the Right Mix\nWith the move to digital tools, it may be surprising to learn that physical IDs will also play an integral part in identity verification going forward. \u201CEntrust believes the blending of physical and digital will be really important,\u201D Wetmore says.\nToday, so-called eIDs\u2014physical identification containing a chip for electronic verification\u2014are on the rise, with more than 164 countries already issuing e-passports. The pandemic helped usher in this change, thanks to demand for contactless solutions, although consumers are still catching up. In Entrust\u2019s survey, 43 percent of respondents said they already had an eID, 36 percent said they didn\u2019t, and 21 percent weren\u2019t sure. This demonstrates that there\u2019s confusion on the issue, since in many countries, including the U.S., passport holders are automatically issued an e-passport. (Only 27 percent of U.S. survey respondents said they had one.) But when eIDs are an option, they\u2019re popular. Seventy percent of respondents said they\u2019d use an electronic ID if one were available. In the future, hybrid solutions\u2014a driver\u2019s license with a scannable RFID chip, for example\u2014will be pervasive.   \n\u201CIn the hybrid future, consumers can use a highly secure passport document to enroll for a digital identity and use that online or via their phone,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CThat identity-verification mechanism takes a high-assurance physical identity and turns it into a high-assurance digital identity. It\u2019s a trend we see happening today, and our technology supports it.\u201D\nDecentralized Identity and Ownership Is the Future\nTo unlock seamless identity verification going forward, consumers will need to share more information\u2014an inevitability they accept.\nIn Entrust\u2019s survey, 74 percent of respondents agreed that sharing personal information in exchange for goods, services, or apps was unavoidable. This is why decentralized identity, which uses distributed ledger technologies (blockchain, for example) for verification, is intriguing. In this scenario, consumers could control which information is shared with a third party through a digital identity wallet that confirms or denies a verification request. For example, you could scan your phone to prove that you\u2019re over 21, but that would be the only information shared with the restaurant or liquor store\u2014not your home address, your email address, or even your date of birth, which is something on everyone\u2019s drivers license. It would simply confirm that you\u2019re over 21. \n\u201CThe future is decentralized identity,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CIn your mobile wallet, you\u2019ll have a number of verifiable credentials. Then you can choose which one you want to use for what service, which makes it really helpful as well as an easy experience.\u201D\nDecentralized identity eliminates reliance on third parties and helps consumers retain control of their identifiers\u2014an easier and more secure approach to daily verification.\n\u201CIn the future of travel, your whole journey will be powered by shared, trusted documents that transfer from government to industry,\u201D Wilson says. \u201CThat process will be supported by trusted infrastructure with decentralized identity, and we\u2019ll start seeing that implemented in the next two years.\u201D\nUltimately, consumers will be able to just share the information that truly matters.\n\u201CPeople will start to have a greater ability to only release the minimum amount of data required for a service or transaction,\u201D Wetmore says. \u201CAs digital adoption goes up, friction goes down, and people\u2019s control over their personal information will increase.\u201D\nThis story was produced by WIRED Brand Lab for Entrust.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6411edc64ac1d7b657dc7c51\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/ETDC_Wired_HeroImage_PASSWORDLESS_FUTURE_1280x720NoText_.jpg","author":null,"title":"Our Passwordless Future","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/our-passwordless-future\/","tags":[""]},{"date":"03.15.2023","summary":"Founders and investors say the bank opened doors\u2014and offered perks\u2014no other bank would. Now companies may face a funding gap.","post_content":"WHEN REAL-ESTATE-STARTUP COFOUNDER Vai Gupta visited downtown San Francisco from the suburbs last year, he borrowed a conference room at a branch of Silicon Valley Bank to host a quick business meeting, just like he has several times over the past decade. Gupta also has leaned on the bank for networking events, financial tutorials, and discount codes for business software and services. Other banks offer competing perks, but SVB\u2019s total package had won Gupta\u2019s loyalty, until the tech-focused financial giant cratered last week.\nNow Gupta is among thousands of customers wondering whether they will ever again find a financial institution that offers the unique blend of benefits, savvy, and speed that SVB delivered to entrepreneurs. Founded about 40 years ago by a Stanford University professor who teamed with banking experts after noticing students struggling to fund business ideas, Silicon Valley Bank treated startup founders like royalty long before their companies ever generated a profit or even raised significant funding.\nBy offering loans, guidance, and bountiful bottles of fine wine and all-expenses-paid ski trips to companies too small in sales for bigger banks to handhold, SVB quickly became the go-to bank for anyone intersecting with the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s globally known startup community. Clients who have grown with SVB\u2019s help include Cisco, Coinbase, and Etsy.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nBut a bad bet on interest rates staying low\u2014they have risen sharply since the start of 2022\u2014and poor crisis communications led to its customers launching a run on the bank over fears about SVB\u2019s financial health. Regulators took control of the bank on March 10, and the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in over the weekend to fully guarantee the remaining deposits.\nSVB\u2019s future remains uncertain, and several entrepreneurs say they are finding that financial institutions rushing to fill the void are falling short in matching its suite of services and extras. Most of all, they wonder what it might mean for them and startups more broadly to lose a trusted partner that helped early-stage companies and founders survive difficult times and secure mortgages or loans others wouldn\u2019t provide. \n\u201CThey understand our innovation ecosystem and build all of their offerings around that,\u201D says Hemant Taneja, the chief executive and managing director of General Catalyst, a venture capital firm that banks with SVB. \u201CThey have the trust of the VC community that they will help these companies through thick and thin.\u201D\nTaneja\u2019s firm joined several others yesterday calling for companies to restore their deposits and lending with SVB, describing it as \u201Cnow one of the safest and most secure banks in the country.\u201D The bank posted on its website yesterday that under the oversight of federal regulators it is honoring all existing loans and welcoming new clients. SVB deferred a request for comment for this story to the FDIC, which declined the invitation. A source at the bank says a few dozen companies expressed interest yesterday in securing new loans.\nSVB's at-least temporary demise has added to existing economic uncertainty in tech. Rising interest rates have throttled startups\u2019 access to cheap cash from investors over the past year. Losing access to the loans and connections that SVB provided could accelerate the collapse of some companies and force others to pare their ambitions\u2014and potentially payrolls\u2014until consumer and investor confidence in the economy rebounds.Gupta, the real estate entrepreneur, is already missing SVB. He wires money internationally at least a couple of times a month for his startup BonfireDAO, which aims to lower barriers to buying properties using blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. He estimates that Chase, his new bank, will charge him $5,000 a year for the transfers, which SVB provided for free.\nSVB also offered customers freebies through a dedicated section in its mobile app long before other banks dangled similar discounts to startups, says Gupta, who from SVB has taken advantage of Amazon Web Services cloud computing credits and free DocuSign e-signature services. He attended over a dozen SVB events, including sessions on finding cofounders and pitching investors. The bank would also let him stop by for a free lunch or to use a meeting room during business trips. \u201CThey were very hospitable,\u201D Gupta says. He says he might now have to shell out for a WeWork membership.\nEntrepreneur Adam Zbar has enjoyed the use of an SVB ski house with a dock on California\u2019s Lake Tahoe. As CEO of meal delivery company Sunbasket, he would use it to host weeklong retreats for his management team. The bank would bring in a top chef for a night and exclusive wines from SVB\u2019s winery clients. \u201CIt was phenomenal,\u201D Zbar says.\nSVB sponsorships also helped pay for trips for Los Angeles tech entrepreneurs to ski at Mammoth Mountain in California and surf at a human-made ranch constructed amid farms, says Zach James, co-CEO of ad tech company Zefr. SVB would take clients to race fancy cars, go backstage at music festivals, and meet vintners at private sessions at Napa Valley wineries to the point that it hosted 300 wine-related events one year.\nRivals had ramped up. JPMorgan Chase announced hiring several top bankers from SVB over the past few years. First Republic Bank was making progress adding tech clients. But their main focus remained elsewhere. \nLaw firms and recruiting and consulting companies are also major sponsors of tech industry schmoozing, though none of them\u2014and certainly no other bank\u2014came close to matching SVB\u2019s largesse toward companies far away from listing on Wall Street, the entrepreneurs and several investors say. \u201CThey were one of the key underwriters of the community,\u201D says Paige Craig, who has been a customer of the bank as an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist. \u201CIt\u2019s a big hole to fill.\u201D\nFor all the fancy perks, the ease of borrowing money from SVB has been the biggest draw for many companies. Startups take out bank loans to diversify their financing, and they often can secure the dollars without giving up as many shares as they have to provide venture investors.\nZefr\u2019s James has taken out loans for his company several times through SVB after shopping around. In some cases, the bank takes a small ownership stake in the borrowers. Other times it defers principal payments for a year or two or allows for repayment in a single lump sum. \u201CIt was the catch-all for startups,\u201D James says of SVB.Generally, it offered among the least-restrictive terms and equally competitive interest rates, entrepreneurs say. If a borrower failed, SVB was known to handle it more gracefully than other lenders. Effectively, according to language seen by WIRED, SVB would support companies as long as their venture capital backers, often clients of the bank, did not abandon them. \u201CBankers become a lifeline when you get into trouble, and if they stand by you, I take that seriously,\u201D says James of his loyalty to the now crushed bank. \nRoger Smith, SVB\u2019s founding CEO, told the Computer History Museum in 2014 that the bank did not sacrifice profits by being flexible. \u201CWhen the music stops, we want two chairs, not just one,\u201D he said. \u201CBut we were able to help people grow and \u2026 we were part of the flow.\u201D\nJust ask Zbar, the former Sunbasket chief. He dreamed up the meal delivery company in 2013 after he had spent through the venture funding he had raised for a different idea. He had no money to pay back a bank loan. But his banker at SVB loved the Sunbasket pitch, and investors were supportive, so SVB agreed to allow Zbar to keep operating month-to-month on new terms as the food venture progressed.\n\u201CI remember having some unpleasant conversations where I was like, wow, you know, you took a piece of my hide, but my business still survived,\u201D says Zbar, now chief executive of HamsaPay, which uses blockchain for commercial loan financing. He believes other banks are less flexible than SVB. \u201CThey just freeze it, and you're done,\u201D he says.  Zbar even welcomed his SVB banker as a bachelor-party guest. \nTo be sure, Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s reliance on relationships and knowledge of venture capitalists to guide its lending decisions raises questions about whether it perpetuated exclusion of women, racial minorities, or other groups historically overlooked by the startup financing industry. Investors say some of those issues may be valid, but the bank did open up opportunities.\nSVB fronted cash to people of underrepresented backgrounds trying to buy into venture capital funds, says the investor Craig, who runs Outlander VC. It provided home mortgages to investors early in their careers who couldn\u2019t get them elsewhere, based on a deep understanding of the tech companies its customers were betting on, Craig says. \u201CI really hope they rebuild and reconstitute. No one understood founders and innovators as well as SVB,\u201D he says.  \nAs entrepreneurs have fanned out to other banks in recent days to shift their deposits from SVB, their experiences have reminded them of what they enjoyed about SVB. James\u2019 Zefr has not found a single bank that can offer every service he wants, so he is using one to borrow money and another for conventional accounts. He does not expect Zefr\u2019s growth to slow, but says his company \u201Cwill have to suffer worse terms or take on a bit more risk.\u201D\nGupta, who is chief technology officer of BonfireDAO, recalls how he was able to open an account with SVB entirely online while in Singapore at his previous startup a decade ago, an option he has not found as he now searches for SVB alternatives. \u201CThey were just the first one to really propose solutions,\u201D he says of his early interactions with SVB. \u201CI never shopped around again.\u201D\nHe wrote on LinkedIn last week that \u201Cmany startups like [his] have lost a valuable friend, partner, and source of support.\u201D He says his heart wants to stick with SVB if it resurrects, but he\u2019s no longer sure it\u2019s financially prudent to do so, no matter the constant aid, invaluable discounts, or occasional free conference room.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/641204b750a2c32c8d5d28a1\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Silicon-Valley-Shutdown-Business-1248000449.jpg","author":"BY PARESH DAVE","title":"How Silicon Valley Bank Became Startups\u2019 Best Friend","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/wine-skiing-and-loans-how-silicon-valley-bank-became-startups-best-friend\/","tags":["","FINANCE","VENTURE CAPITAL","STARTUPS","MONEY","CRYPTOCURRENCY"]},{"date":"03.15.2023","summary":"The UN\u2019s refugee agency has partnered with blockchain and money transfer companies to get vital aid to people displaced by conflict.","post_content":"IN THE 12 months since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, more than 14 million Ukrainians have been forced from their homes in what the United Nations has described as \u201Cthe fastest, largest displacement in decades.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/64110f9bd531bd05a681abb9\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/w30_MARCH_DEMOCRACY_UKRAINE-CRYPTO.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"In Ukraine, Crypto Finds a Purpose","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ukraine-crypto-refugee-aid\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","UKRAINE","RUSSIA","WIRED30"]},{"date":"03.13.2023","summary":"People in the country hoped to earn a steady payout from Wi-Fi hot spots. But many are left holding useless hardware.","post_content":"IN THE REMOTE mountain village of Zaarouieh, about an hour\u2019s drive south of Beirut, Ahmed Abu Daher stands on the roof of a half-built house overlooking a wooded valley. He gestures at a drab gray box about the size of a takeout container. A couple of wires emerge from it, snaking off across the bare concrete. \n\u201CIt\u2019s actually one of the hardest forms of mining,\u201D says Abu Daher, 22, an architecture graduate and operator of a crypto mining pool. \u201COf course you need decent internet, reliable electricity, but the altitude of the position is really important.\u201D\nThe box is a Helium hot spot. It transmits a long-range Wi-Fi signal and, in conjunction with hundreds of thousands of other hot spots, forms a global decentralized network designed for the internet of things. In return for installing and running it, Abu Daher receives a cryptocurrency called HNT. Looking over the lush hillsides as the sound of a geriatric diesel engine sputters in the distance, it\u2019s hard to imagine what \u201Cthings\u201D the little gray box might be communicating with.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nLebanon\u2019s economic free fall over the past few years, combined with a relatively high degree of tech literacy and a culture of hustle, has turned the country into a crucible of sorts for testing the utility of crypto assets. Stablecoin use has boomed as people attempt to circumvent a basket case of a banking system. A community of ingenious miners continues to scrape profits out of the decrepit electricity grid, and some canny speculators have even managed to recover the savings they lost in the collapse of the banking system. Many turned to Helium.\nOn the Helium Explorer, a dashboard displaying the location and activity of hot spots globally, Lebanon shows as an intense constellation of luminous green dots surrounded by almost-blank space. The Hotspotty app, which shows the state of the Helium network, records approximately 6,500 hot spots installed across Lebanon. In the rest of the Middle East, only the United Arab Emirates comes close to the levels of adoption seen in Lebanon, with around half that number.\nHelium\u2019s promise to become the backbone network for smart devices (and delivery of breakfast burritos by drone) has little to do with its appeal in Lebanon. Lebanese citizens, many of them struggling as the country\u2019s economy tanked, simply saw the financial yield from the network\u2019s hot spots as an easy way to make hard currency. But as the value of HNT tokens has fallen, many people have seen their funds depleted and are stuck holding onto a sleek but pretty useless piece of hardware. \nIn the headquarters of God of Mining, a mining pool on the outskirts of Beirut, CEO Joe Manih sighs as he gestures at 30 or so hot spots of various brands piled on a table. \u201CWe just disconnected them last week,\u201D he says. \u201CThey weren\u2019t worth the effort, and now we can\u2019t even sell them.\u201D\nHelium was founded in 2013 by Shawn Fanning, the cofounder of Napster, and Amir Haleem under the somewhat ominous name of Skynet Phase 1. Initially there was no crypto element to the project and, despite drawing VC investment, it struggled to get off the ground. In 2019 its founders hit on the idea of using blockchain tokenization to incentivize participation in the network. In principle, anybody can purchase a Helium hot spot for $400 to $500, plug it into an internet connection and power source, and become a node. In return, the user receives Helium\u2019s native HNT tokens, which can be traded on the open market.It was initially lauded as one of the few crypto projects with a clear utility. More devices were becoming connected to the internet, and Helium was going to be the infrastructure for them. It would tell farmers when to irrigate their fields, help track down stolen e-scooters, and keep track of urban air quality. It was even going to find your dog when it got lost. In early 2022 The New York Times ran a piece about Helium with the headline \u201CMaybe There\u2019s a Use for Crypto After All.\u201D\nWhere other cryptocurrencies derived their value mostly from market forces\u2014they were worth whatever someone would pay for them\u2014Helium was going to be able to sell access to its network to companies needing to use the infrastructure, giving it a more predictable and robust source of income. \u201CAs usage grows across networks, the value of the HNT ecosystem increases,\u201D Helium\u2019s chief operating officer, Frank Mong, wrote in a September 2022 blog post.\nHelium did not respond to a request for comment.\nMoe Saleh, who ran several hot spots in Lebanon and helped many others install and configure theirs, says he was attracted to Helium because he \u201Csaw that this project had a physical, technical aspect. Not like other crypto projects.\u201D\nDuring the 2021 crypto bull market, HNT reached a high of $50 per token, and hot spot operators could expect to receive more than decent returns. Abu Daher, who claims to have programmed over a thousand Helium hot spots for Lebanese clients, says that at the time a properly installed hot spot returned around $50 per day. The $500 cost of the machine could be quickly recouped, then it would start providing a healthy dollarized income.\nTo thousands of Lebanese mired in economic crisis, this was an attractive proposition. Between 2018 and 2022 the Lebanese economy went through a contraction that the World Bank called one of the \u201Cworst economic crises globally since the mid-19th century.\u201D One statistic captures the profound effect this had on the average Lebanese citizen: In 2018, 18 percent of Lebanese households earned less than $400 per month. Just three years later that figure stood at 92 percent. Hyperinflation ravaged the Lebanese lira, destroying over 95 percent of its value. The banks imposed draconian capital controls, leaving clients to watch their life savings evaporate as the lira spiraled. The state shriveled and withdrew from most people\u2019s lives. Traffic lights stopped working, making every junction on Lebanon\u2019s already dicey roads a hair-raising dash. The national grid delivered, at best, one hour of power per day. The value of police and military monthly salaries fell from $800 to less than $100, and many stopped turning up to work as the petrol they used to get there cost more than they earned.\n\u201CIn Lebanon,\u201D Saleh says, \u201Cany opportunity people see to keep on living, they take it.\u201D \nThe promise of a machine that could be plugged in to generate more revenue than most people in the country could earn was irresistible. Many people took what money they could scrape together and paid the highly elevated black-market prices for hot spots.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/640bbfe3d6703b9a3671a88e\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/business_helium_crypto_hotspot.jpg","author":"BY JACOB RUSSELL","title":"Helium\u2019s IoT-Crypto Network Is Barely Hanging On in Lebanon","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/heliums-iot-crypto-network-is-barely-hanging-on-in-lebanon\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","BLOCKCHAIN"]},{"date":"03.08.2023","summary":"Companies Do Better When Their Teams Are Diverse. Here Are Some Strategies\u2026","post_content":"OVER THE PAST decade, technology has changed radically. Machine learning has taken off, \u2018blockchain\u2019 has entered the lexicon, virtual reality has emerged from a winter. But one thing remains the same: a gender gap in the industry.\nIn Europe, for example, the current proportion of women in tech roles is 22 percent, McKinsey research shows. And the women who are there lag their male peers when it comes to promotions \u2013 in technical roles, only 52 women were promoted to manager for every 100 men at the same level, according to an analysis by the consultancy in 2021. That compared with 86 women for every 100 men across all job types. \n\u201CTo close the gap, we need to create environments that allow women to stay in the industry and to thrive,\u201D says Anne-Marie Imafidon, CEO of Stemettes, a social enterprise she co-founded in 2013 to support girls, young women and non-binary people to pursue careers in science, technology and engineering. \u201CIf you do that, problems with retention and promotion will fall away.\u201D \nStemettes is 10 years old, but Imafidon says that the young women the organisation works with are \u201Cstill asking the same question: \u2018Can I do this even though I can\u2019t see anyone who looks like me?\u2019\u201D\nFor the technology industry, fixing the problem is not just a matter of ethics. There is also a business imperative. For one, studies show that more diverse teams tend to perform better. For another, tech companies are facing a shortage of qualified people. In the EU alone, there will be a shortfall of between 1.4 million and 3.9 million tech staff by 2027, McKinsey\u2019s research shows. The consultancy estimates that if the share of women in tech roles could be increased to 45 percent \u2013 the equivalent of 3.9 million additional women \u2013 by the same year, the skills gap would be closed. \nClearly, working and corporate cultures need to change so that women have an equal chance of being hired and promoted in tech roles. And, of course, the talent pipeline needs to be developed by encouraging and inspiring more women to consider tech as a career in the first place. There are many aspects to the solution, and what follows is by no means an exhaustive set of options. But here are four strategies for companies to consider\u2026\n1. Set radical diversity targets\nTech firms where women account for more than 35 percent of staff are often deemed to be doing comparatively well. In that context, a full gender diversity target is punchy \u2013 but a number of businesses are making it work. AI company Mad Street Den, a California headquartered start-up with offices in Chennai, India, New York, and Dubai, was founded on the basis that gender equality would be a defining feature. It has close to a 50\/50 split among its 275 staff. \nAshwini Asokan, Mad Street Den\u2019s founder and CEO, says the company had a clear reason for the 50\/50 metric, which was \u201Cdiversity of thought\u201D that would produce better products and technology. \u201CNo entity survives when it only has one variety of thought.\u201DAsokan says that recruitment has never been an insurmountable issue \u2013 so Mad Street Den focuses its efforts on helping women to stay with the company. Measures include 100 percent pay parity between men and women, an on-site nursery, and detailed discussions at the interview stage about the candidate\u2019s responsibilities and support network outside work. For a period of time when a lot of staff had small babies, there was a nanny in the office.\n\u201CWorking in a start-up, the work-life balance can be brutal and you need a strong support system in place to make it work,\u201D says Asokan. \u201CBut it\u2019s not an either\/or situation \u2013 it\u2019s not the case that just because you\u2019re a new mom, you don\u2019t want a director\u2019s role. If you deserve that role in the organisation, what are we going to do to ensure you are supported? How do we keep that person and support them and take care of them?\u201D \n2. Introduce full pay transparency\nA study of senior female technologists by the US bank and credit card company Capital One found that fair and good compensation was a top driver for staying in their job. \nYet in many tech firms, there is a pay gap. One way to address this is pay transparency, and some companies are finding success in taking a particularly radical approach. Consider Buffer, which has published the salaries of all its employees online since 2013. The company, whose software tool helps companies schedule social media posts, also has a formula that sets pay for each role.\nWhile knowing exactly what all of your colleagues earn does \u201Cfeel foreign\u201D to many staff when they start, it also \u201Cbroke down barriers for women\u201D, says Jenny Terry, Buffer\u2019s director of business operations. Full pay transparency has had the additional benefit of \u201Creally kickstarting recruitment and lifting the number of applications we had\u201D because people knew what they would be paid, she adds.\nStill, in 2018 the company analysed its unadjusted gender pay gap \u2013 that is to say, the difference between what women and men are paid overall, not just in direct comparisons of two people doing the same job (known as an adjusted gender pay gap). This assessment showed that women in the company earned nine percent less than men, and in 2019, that figure rose to 15 percent. The reason for the gap was that Buffer had more men in technical roles, which paid better. \n\u201CIt was humbling for us because we had relied a bit too much on the formula and the transparency to say \u2018we pay equitably\u2019,\u201D said Terry. \nThis further focussed their minds on \u201Cmaking sure we had highly qualified female candidates for technical roles\u201D, she says.\nIt has paid off: Buffer has now narrowed the overall pay gap to less than one percent. The company employs 34 women and 44 men.\n3. Use AI to root out language bias\nIn workplace performance reviews, women are 22 percent more likely to get feedback about their personality than men. As part of that feedback, women are seven times more likely to be described as \u201Copinionated\u201D, 11 times more likely to be described as \u201Cabrasive\u201D and 3.5 times more likely to be described as \u201Cambitious\u201D, according to research from Seattle-based Textio.\n\u201CWhether the manager intended it to be positive or negative, that aspect of the feedback was not about the quality of their work or whether they achieved the deliverable in a project,\u201D says Kieran Snyder, CEO of Textio. \u201CThe potential for harm is greater in tech organisations because you already have a gender imbalance.\u201DUnconscious bias in language creates problems both in hiring and in retention. The wrong choice of words, however unwitting, may put women off applying for tech jobs in the first place, and performance reviews that turn into personal criticism undermine confidence and can deter employees from applying for promotions. Training is one way that companies try to address this issue \u2013 but some companies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI).\nTextio makes AI software to pick up problematic language in recruitment and feedback. Snyder says Textio\u2019s corporate customers see a 30 percent increase in the number of women applying for roles if they use its tool when creating a job ad.\nThe question, as with all AI, is how the humans building the natural language processing tool define the problem \u2013 what is biased language? Snyder says the answer lies in having genuine diversity in the team creating the tools. Textio has an equal number of male and female employees.\n4. Intentionally build a pipeline\nA survey last year of more than 2,000 UK school and university students by PwC found that only 27 percent of female students would consider a career in technology. That compares to 61 percent of male students. \nIn addition, just 16 percent of the female students had had a career in technology suggested to them, compared with 33 percent of males. And the lack of role models was notable \u2013 only 22 percent of students could name a famous woman working in tech, whereas two-thirds could name a famous man. \nSome companies are taking a proactive approach to addressing this by building a pipeline of female talent for all levels of their organisation. \nThat can start by forging connections with grassroots groups such as Girls Who Code or Stemettes. Anne-Marie Imafidon set up Stemettes to give girls, young women and non-binary people the chance to attend workshops and join mentoring programmes with technology and engineering companies. \u201CIf you can see it, you can be it,\u201D she says. \nImafidon also encourages companies hiring for tech roles to be more open-minded to people who may lack a traditional computer science or maths degree, but have other experience and can be trained in the technical skills they need. \u201CIt\u2019s not just about HTML \u2013 there\u2019s value and benefits in the technology space from a range of experiences \u2013 a trained dancer can become a virtual and mixed reality expert,\u201D she says, as that background gives them a deep understanding of movement.\nTo build a pipeline of future leaders, organisations should also ensure that female talent within the business have opportunities to meet and learn from women at the top of their technical specialism.\nThis is something that happens in the British Army. Take Captain Catherine Henderson, who joined the Royal Corps of Signals after gaining her commission at Sandhurst in 2014. The Corps provides battlefield communications and information systems. Through its Inspiring Women in Technology networking group Henderson has had the chance to learn from senior women in both the military and the tech industry.\n\u201CAs a young woman embarking on a career in a field that people would label as male-heavy, there is a lot of inspiration to take from women who have been successful in their careers, gained the technical qualifications and done it around having a family,\u201D says Henderson. \u201CThey are wearing a lot of hats \u2013 mother, commander, technical expert. As a junior officer, it was really nice to have the chance to see that these things were possible.\u201D\nThat sense that these things are possible \u2013 whether for girls at school or young women already embarking on careers \u2013 will be a vital component to addressing this challenge in the years ahead. There is a mountain to climb, but if aspiration can be created, opportunities extended and attitudes changed, we may have a shot at climbing it. And the idea of increasing the number of women in European tech by 3.9m may start to feel like less of a pipe dream.\nFind out more\nWIRED Consulting brings WIRED's network and knowledge to businesses and thought leaders.

Wade, and what\u2019s left to inspire hope.","post_content":"WHEN I FIRST see Margaret Atwood, she\u2019s bundled up. Red hat over her famous silver curls, long puffy coat, boots befitting a Canadian winter. The right outfit for a profoundly gray Toronto day, especially since she\u2019d trudged over snow-piled sidewalks to meet me. \u201CI always walk everywhere!\u201D she says merrily, unspooling her scarf. \nIt almost made me feel bad for taking a cab to the restaurant. But best not to compare oneself to the author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. She\u2019d strolled over to tell me about her new book, Old Babes in the Wood. It\u2019s her ninth short story collection, adding to a sprawling body of work that includes 17 novels and 18 volumes of poetry. \nBOOKS\nDystopia Is All Too Plausible in The School for Good Mothers\nKATE KNIBBS\nTV\nMade for Love, Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and the Trap of Dystopian TV\nKATE KNIBBS\nBOOKS\nMargaret Atwood's The Testaments Is Done With Handmaids\nSOPHIE CHARARA\nOld Babes in the Wood gives readers Atwood at her most whimsical: a snail swaps bodies with a human, an alien tries to translate a fairy tale, a seance summons the ghost of George Orwell. This varied fare is bookended by two suites of bruising stories about Nell and Tig, a devoted couple Atwood first introduced in 2006\u2019s Moral Disorder. This time around, Nell mourns Tig\u2019s illness and eventual death; time blurs as she grieves, skipping through memories of earlier seasons of her life. These stories layer onto each other, forming a melancholy love story as affecting as any of Atwood\u2019s strongest work. \nAs the author sat down, I pulled a list of questions from my purse, eager to get insight into her newest work and seemingly indefatigable creative process. I did, eventually, but our conversation ended up being wider-ranging and slightly stranger than expected. With exactly nothing to prove and no one left to impress, she seemed happiest bantering. (By the way, in case Condé Nast\u2019s expense department is reading this: I didn\u2019t order the $45 foie gras. Or the whiskey. You try telling an 83-year-old living literary legend what they can or can\u2019t order.) We might have kept talking straight until dinner, except Atwood realized she was very late for her next appointment, and bundled back up in record time.\nBut returning to the beginning of the meal. After removing all her winter gear, she kicked off the conversation with a very WIRED opening line. \n\u201CDid you know,\u201D Atwood asked, \u201Cthat amongst other things, I\u2019m also a tech entrepreneur?\u201D\nWIRED: I heard you invented\u2014was it a remote book-signing device? \nMargaret Atwood: Yes. Longpen. One day FedEx showed up with a parcel and I signed for it. I thought, why can\u2019t we use this sort of thing to sign books? I thought my signature was going through the air and somehow turning into ink somewhere, which of course it wasn\u2019t. When I said that to people more knowledgeable than myself, they laughed and laughed. So I said, OK, that doesn\u2019t happen \u2026 but could it? They researched, and there was nothing similar. The closest sort of device to what I was envisioning was used for remote surgery. \nActual surgery? \nActual surgery. There was nothing like it. So we made it. Publishing didn\u2019t quite grasp the beauty of it, but now it\u2019s used in business. Do you have any other tales of tech entrepreneurship I should know about? Have you secretly joined BookTok? \nNo, but I\u2019ve heard about it. It\u2019s really young people, so I think if I went on there, they\u2019d scream and run. \nThey\u2019d be excited to see you. \nI\u2019m not sure about that. I know older businesspeople don\u2019t like it so much, because they can\u2019t tell young people what they ought to be reading anymore. And they don\u2019t necessarily have the same taste. \nI definitely don\u2019t always like the books I see recommended on TikTok. But I\u2019m older than your average TikTokker, too. \nWell, and tastes change over time. A lot of the books you loved in your teens, you\u2019ll revisit later and think: Why did I ever like that? Then you\u2019ll think something is the most boring thing you\u2019ve ever read, but pick it back up at 35 and see the beauty.\nThat reminds me of one of the first questions I was going to ask you. \nWhat\u2019s it like to be really, really old? \nNo!\nIt\u2019s more fun than you\u2019d think.\nWell, actually\u2014expand on that. \nAs long as you\u2019re not actually dying or having dementia, you just have a lot less to lose. You can color quite a lot further outside the lines, especially compared to young people these days, in an age of anxiety. People are afraid of being beaten up by their peers on social media. They haven\u2019t been hardened in the fire. If you have been hardened, you can just let it rip. \nPHOTOGRAPH: JINGYU LIN\nThe actual question I wanted to ask, about how our perspectives change over time, relates to one of the stories in Old Babes in the Wood. \u201CFreeforall,\u201D a speculative piece about a world where widespread fear of disease leads to government tyranny, was originally published in 1986\u2014Oh, yes. The editors were very keen to include it. They thought it was of historical interest, since it\u2019s kind of a flip on Handmaid\u2019s Tale. \nAh, so you didn\u2019t pick it yourself? \nI thought it was too long, so I changed it a bit. I mean, I think it is of historical interest, but as a story-story, it wouldn\u2019t be top of my list. I\u2019m being self-critical here. \nI thought it was great. So I assumed you\u2019d chosen to include it. \nWell, if I\u2019d wanted to dig my heels in, I could\u2019ve said no. \nI was going to ask you if you felt as connected to it now as you did when you originally wrote it. Do you still feel connected to the work you wrote decades ago? \nAs when I was writing it? Of course not. \nDo you even feel like the same person? \nNo. I got older. It would be bizarre if I was the same person. I\u2019d be a vampire. \nSo you don\u2019t generally consider revising or revisiting old work\u2014\nA whole book? No. I changed \u201CFreeforall\u201D to make it more succinct. But to redo a novel, no. \nI don\u2019t think you need to redo any of your novels, by the way. \nThey are a snapshot in time. They are of their age. So, much to my surprise, The Edible Woman [Atwood\u2019s 1969 debut novel] still sells a lot. That was from the age where there weren\u2019t even pantyhose. \nJust stockings? \nTwo stockings, and you held them up with garter belts or girdles. But young people still connect with The Edible Woman, because it\u2019s about the job problem\u2014what are you going to live on? What jobs can you have, and what comes next? Should I get married? I mean, \u201CShould I get married?\u201D was more pressing in those days. More of an either\/or choice. \nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBuy this book at:\nAmazon\nBookshop.org\nBooks-A-Million\nApple Books\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Are the Nell and Tig of Old Babes in the Wood the same people, to you, as the Nell and Tig of Moral Disorder? \nYes. Otherwise their names would be different. [Both laughing.]\nSo they\u2019re not, say, in a different dimension\u2014\nThey\u2019re not in a different dimension. \nOK. Just wanted to make sure there\u2019s only one Nell and Tig cinematic universe. \nJust the one. Why don\u2019t you ask me about snails? \nOh, of course. Tell me about snails. \nMost shape-changer stories are about bears, wolves, seals, and snakes. Those are the main ones in folklore. Oh, and I forgot, birds. But there is one about a snail. It\u2019s Chinese. A rather quiet, well-behaved wife spends half her life in a bucket outside the door as a snail. \nWas the Chinese folklore about the bucket-snail wife the inspiration for your snail story?  \nWell, yes and no. I\u2019ve always been keen on snails. \nIf you had to body-swap with an animal, what kind of animal do you think would make the best Margaret Atwood? \nA fox. They\u2019re wily.\nThere are a ton of foxes in my neighborhood now. They\u2019re eating all the local hens. \n[Several minutes of detailed discussion about how to best fox-proof a henhouse takes place.] If you go onto my Substack, you can find three stories having to do with domestic fowl. Do you like Substack? \nSo far, so good. But it\u2019s work. I don\u2019t like work. I\u2019m quite lazy. \nYou don\u2019t seem lazy. I read somewhere that you\u2019d described other writers as entering the \u201Cgold watch and goodbye\u201D portion of their careers. You could\u2019ve entered that phase if you wanted to rest on your laurels, but instead you\u2019re producing this vital new work. \nYou do it because it\u2019s what you like to do.\nHas your writing routine changed? \nI don\u2019t have one. I never have. When you have a day job, you just stuff it in when you can, in the evenings. When you have a small child, you do it when they\u2019re down for a nap, and then at school. It shifts around. What is it now? Aeroplanes are good. But not always. Sometimes you would rather watch the movie. Kung Fu Panda, Captain Underpants.\nModern classics. \nI would think so. But yes, routine\u2014part of the reason I don\u2019t have one is that I\u2019m so old, I didn\u2019t go to creative writing school, because there were hardly any back then. That meant nobody told me to specialize. Are you a novelist, a short-story writer, a poet? Nobody said you should choose. \nYou have a reputation for conjuring these very prescient futures. One thing that struck me about this collection, though, is how focused it is on the past. Was this looking-back deliberate? \nNothing is deliberate. I was just writing the stories I wanted to write. I mean, sometimes\u2014there\u2019s that story, \u201CImpatient Griselda.\u201D That was part of a project involving a number of writers, where we were meant to reinterpret The Decameron. It was during early Covid, when we were still disinfecting cardboard boxes from grocery deliveries.\nI remember that phase. \nSo I picked this story, \u201CPatient Griselda,\u201D because it always annoyed me. This woman gets married to a duke, a sadistic monster who subjects her to all kinds of humiliations, which she patiently endures, and she\u2019s supposed to be a model wife. Out upon it, say I. So I redid it into a version where the duke gets devoured.\nI like that version better. \nSo do I. \nAre there other stories in the collection especially dear to your heart? \nI\u2019d never say so. The others would get annoyed at me. I\u2019m of the old school, in which the book has a life. \nWell, I definitely want to talk about your George Orwell story. \nThat was another ask. INQUE magazine. They said, pick whatever dead writer you want to have a conversation with. Orwell was pretty obvious for me, because he was an influence on my work. Plus, he ruined my young life. \nHow so? \nI read Animal Farm without knowing it was an allegory about the Soviet Union. I thought it was really going to be about animals, like Wind in the Willows. \nWhen I was reading the Orwell story, I was thinking about how people always compare Nineteen Eighty-Four to Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World. Yes, in the \u201980s and the \u201990s, we had a contest going, which was going to win? The answer was: Why not both?\nYou did your own twist on both, I think. The MaddAddam books have some echoes of Brave New World, where the BlyssPluss pill is a bit like Huxley\u2019s soma. \nEnhanced sex with no consequence. \nYes! Do you feel like one of your dystopian worlds is more accurate than the other right now? \nWell, right now, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is. But that will change. \nThere\u2019s that saying, \u201CHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it rhymes.\u201D Do you think there\u2019s any way to actually break the rhyme pattern? Should we be hopeful about the future?\nHope is built in. Human beings have hope. If they didn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t get up in the morning. You got up in the morning today and you thought: I hope we all have a nice life.\nI do hope we all have a nice life. \nPeople aren\u2019t going to want to lose their jobs. They don\u2019t want to lose their Medicaid, or Social Security.\nDo you think that\u2019s enough of a bulwark against reactionary forces? \nWell, what determines American elections? Independent voters. The Republicans have been devoted to dismantling FDR\u2019s New Deal ever since Ronald Reagan was elected. Trickle-down economics didn\u2019t work. Trickle-down debt does work\u2014if you\u2019re interested in reading about that, it\u2019s in my book Payback.\nSince you wrote about debt in Payback in 2008, the world has grown increasingly financialized\u2014\nNo, it hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s become financialized in different ways.\nIs this your way of telling me you\u2019re dabbling in crypto? \nNo. But I\u2019ve been observing. We did this virtual course called Practical Utopias this fall. The premise of the course was that people built their own utopias. The social mandate was to be carbon neutral or carbon negative, and scalable. We had hundreds of participants from around the world working in eight teams. It was more of a success than I thought it was going to be. Part of it was going to be an NFT. But then I said, we can\u2019t do this, because these things take a lot of energy.\nSo you didn\u2019t make the NFTs because of their environmental impact? \nWe did eventually, because we found another blockchain that used a different system to handle the energy issue. Tezos.\nEvery single proper noun in the crypto universe would be at home in the MaddAddam world. Bored Apes. It feels impossible to satirize because it\u2019s already so absurd. \nPeople get carried away. Especially if they have too much money, and they\u2019re too young. They get sort of drunk off it.\nI think I might be legally obligated to ask you if you\u2019ve been delving into the world of ChatGPT. \nI know about it. I think we could fix all this anxiety by making it mandatory to have a seal on everything generated by ChatGPT.Like a watermark? \nYes, that\u2019s what I mean. \nDo you think it\u2019s overhyped? \nOrwell already thought it out. Machines that turn out trashy literature for the masses? Nineteen Eighty-Four!\nI was briefly convinced it would clog up the internet with infinite junk\u2014\nIt\u2019s already clogged up.\nExactly. So, I can definitely assure my readers you\u2019re not going to use ChatGPT to create a third trip to Gilead?\n[Atwood places her hand over her heart as if taking an oath.] Why would I do that? That would be bad. \nYou do so many interviews. Are there questions you\u2019ve been waiting for someone to ask you? \nQuestions have changed a lot over the years. Nobody asks me anymore, \u201CWhy do you hate men?\u201D They do ask a lot about hope now, which feels quite significant. It\u2019s on peoples\u2019 minds. Is it all done for? No! That\u2019s why I did Practical Utopias. It was a hopeful project. Do you know about the Future Library of Norway?\nIs that where you wrote a book to be read in the future? \nWell, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a book. We know it\u2019s made of words. There were two strictures: It has to be made of words, and you can\u2019t tell anybody anything else. It could be a letter, a novel, a screenplay, a poem, an essay \u2026\nSo you have a word-based project. \nYes.\nAnd you feel confident people will read it in a hundred or so years? \nI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll be dead. But, it\u2019s a very hopeful project, because it assumes that there will be people, there will be a Norway, that the library of Norway will still exist. \nI wanted to ask about your story \u201CAirborne: A Symposium.\u201D It made me laugh. There was an exchange that very succinctly captured some attitudes about the discourse right now. The characters are academics, and one of their friends has gotten into a controversy. Someone asks which panel she was speaking on when she got in trouble. \u201CGender,\u201D another says. \u201CFuck,\u201D the first character replies. \u201CA snake pit!\u201D Do you feel this is a particularly snake pit-y time?\nTo be in an academic institution, yeah. Very snake pit-y. They\u2019re getting so much pressure from state governments\u2014\nLike Florida\u2019s state government? \nYes, like them for instance. Quite snake pit-y. I feel happy I\u2019m not teaching anymore.\nBack to what you were saying earlier, about having less to lose at this point in your life\u2014do you still worry about the snake pit of the internet or do you feel immune? \nNobody\u2019s immune to anything. You have to understand the different kinds of pressures people feel like they\u2019re under. What do totalitarian governments of any kind try to do immediately? They try to control communications networks. In a coup, they grab the radio and television. They try to shut down communications, and education, so that nothing is taught that isn\u2019t copacetic with their own views. Those are two things totalitarian governments will try to do. A third is to control the judiciary, so the views of the judges and lawyers are the same as the regime. This is an old playbook. That\u2019s why I struggle with feeling hopeful. \nI am not counting the United States out. It\u2019s a diverse country with a lot of ordinary people fighting back. The midterms. Overturning Roe v. Wade was not a smart move. \nI will say, I was assuming there\u2019d be more of a giant Women\u2019s March\u2013style outpouring into the streets when it got overturned\u2014\nWhat you need right now is grassroots, block-by-block, constituency-by-constituency organization. To say, here are other things people want to take away from you: women\u2019s health care, Medicaid, Social Security, the education of your child. The left has not been smart. Number one, they should have shown some support for freedom of expression, whereas in fact they rolled their eyes and said that\u2019s a tool of the right. It didn\u2019t start out that way. In the history of the United States, it was actually the union movement.\nI haven\u2019t actually seen many lefties sneering at freedom of expression. Is there an example that leaps out in your mind? \nMay I quote Elizabeth Barrett Browning? \u201CLet me count the ways.\u201D So that\u2019s your job, you can have a look. Some of us signed that Harper\u2019s letter calling for more reasonable discourse and got shouted at a lot from the left. \u201CNo, we don\u2019t want to do that. We just want to denounce people.\u201D That\u2019s just a gift to the right. The center has to repel the extremist hordes on both sides. It\u2019s always the center that\u2019s under the most crossfire.\nPeople on the left are criticizing the Harper\u2019s letter, sure. But people on the right are banning books. \nA lot of the impulses are the same.\nI hope that\u2019s not true. \nDare I say Chairman Mao? Joseph Stalin?\nDo you think they were really leftists? \nNot if you mean the nice people you know who want things to be fairer. But if you mean the flags they were flying, yes. Look at the early history of the USSR. Very communitarian, equal rights for women. That got shut down very quickly. Early Christianity was also very communitarian. And then what happened? You must be aware of the fact that these things go in cycles. \nThat\u2019s what I was talking about earlier, thinking about ways to actually break history\u2019s rhyme pattern. Or are we doomed for everything progressive to be met with reactionary forces?\nI don\u2019t like the term \u201Cprogressive.\u201D It assumes there\u2019s a yellow brick road that leads to a city of Oz that doesn\u2019t exist. I prefer to say \u201Cfairer.\u201D Can things be fairer? Yes. Will it take work? Yes. Do you get to just call yourself progressive and pat yourself on the back? Not in my book. Plus, the eugenics movement, which caused a lot of women to be sterilized, was thought of as a progressive thing. So let\u2019s do a little rearranging of the language that doesn\u2019t come with that baggage. \u201CFairer.\u201D I like that.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/645171970124a91cee27d7cc\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Margaret-Atwood-Culture_002_16.jpg","author":"BY KATE KNIBBS","title":"Margaret Atwood Is Ready to Let It Rip","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/margaret-atwood-interview\/","tags":["","BOOKS","LITERATURE","FICTION","DYSTOPIA","MAGAZINE-31.05","BIG INTERVIEW"]},{"date":"03.03.2023","summary":"Privacy Pool\u2019s founder says he can preserve users\u2019 privacy while keeping money launderers and regulators at bay.","post_content":"WHEN THE US government announced sanctions against Tornado Cash last August, the warning seemed to be aimed at all crypto mixers. \nAlleging that Tornado Cash had been used to launder $7 billion in digital currency\u2014including half a billion dollars tied to Lazarus, a hacking group sponsored by North Korea\u2014the US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control said any service that \u201Cindiscriminately facilitates anonymous transactions\u201D represents a \u201Cthreat to US national security.\u201D\nThat definition fits most mixers, which are typically used to obscure the originators and recipients of crypto transactions by scrambling together funds from a large number of people. By the time depositors withdraw their funds to separate addresses, it is no longer clear whose crypto is whose.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Under the sanctions\u2014which have been challenged in court\u2014US residents are no longer legally allowed to use Tornado Cash. Separately, one of the service\u2019s developers, Alexey Pertsev, is being held in custody in the Netherlands on suspected \u201Cinvolvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering.\u201D\nBut one of the early architects of the Tornado Cash project, Ameen Soleimani, has announced that he\u2019s launching a successor to the sanctioned mixer, Privacy Pools, which he says will still allow users to make private, largely untraceable transactions while discouraging money laundering and other illegal activities. \n\u201CIf Americans want privacy, we have to figure out how to operate within the regulatory paradigm,\u201D says Soleimani (who describes Pertsev\u2019s imprisonment as an \u201Caffront to justice\u201D).\nSoleimani announced the sequel to Tornado Cash on Twitter on February 26, revealing only its name and backing from MolochDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that hands out grants to developers building apps for the Ethereum blockchain, and which Soleimani is closely involved with. \nAt ETH Denver on March 4, he plans to unveil a rudimentary demo, with limits placed on the amount of funds that can pass through the service because the code has not yet been properly audited for bugs. \u201CIt\u2019s not a \u2018put all your money in\u2019 kind of launch,\u201D Soleimani says, \u201Cit\u2019s a \u2018let\u2019s start a conversation\u2019 kind of launch.\u201DThat conversation, he says, is about whether it\u2019s technically possible to satisfy authorities\u2019 need to trace the passage of stolen cryptocurrency while still affording crypto users the financial privacy they demand. \nPrivacy Pool will use a cryptography technology called a \u201Czero-knowledge proof,\u201D by which users are able to demonstrate that their crypto withdrawals are unconnected to deposits made by known criminal wallets.\nThe basic premise, Soleimani says, is that users can \u201Cwithdraw without revealing who they are by publicly proving who they are not.\u201D \nHowever, Soleimani admits that the exact mechanics of the zero-knowledge proof are a mystery even to him. He decided to use it after being approached by an anonymous developer known as Twister, who is working on implementation of the technology. Soleimani says he doesn\u2019t know much about Twister but isn\u2019t concerned about working with an unknown quantity because the service is just a pilot at the moment.\nAndrew Thurman, head of content at blockchain analytics company Nansen, says these kinds of proofs are \u201Cpoised to play a key role\u201D in affording anonymity to crypto users. The technology is gaining traction in crypto circles as developers explore different applications; Ethereum side-chain Polygon is making particularly heavy use of it, and Buterin has been vocal about its potential.\nUnder Soleimani\u2019s system, individual users will be responsible for marking out which other depositors they do not want to be associated with. In practice, he imagines that will mean using blacklists compiled by companies like Nansen, which monitors public blockchains for criminality.\nIn theory, such a design would also limit the amount of funds tied to criminal activity that pass through the mixer, he claims, \u201Cbecause everyone else using it will have the option to isolate [criminal addresses],\u201D reducing the size of the pool in which bad actors can hide. \nThe system wouldn\u2019t mean that criminals couldn\u2019t operate on the mixer, only that they wouldn\u2019t be able to access its full liquidity.\nSoleimani says that an alternative system, where an administrator maintains a blocklist to bar bad actors from the platform entirely, would be prohibitively expensive because adding addresses to a blockchain-hosted list comes at a cost each time, and criminals frequently hop between wallets. It would also raise ethical questions around whether one individual should make  a judgement about who is allowed to use the service.\n\u201CI don\u2019t think I should be in charge of deciding who the good and bad people are for everyone\u2014and nor should anyone else,\u201D says Soleimani. \u201CThis system is different because it allows individuals the choice of who they associate with or not.\u201D\nSoleimani says that Privacy Pools\u2019 clients are likely to be people who want to make transactions privately\u2014those who want to donate to political causes anonymously or conceal the size of their crypto-denominated salary, for example.\nEven before the technical details were released, the project began receiving messages of support from the cypherpunk community, which advocates for the use of cryptography to safeguard personal privacy.\n\u201CCypherpunks like privacy, institutions like privacy, casual investors like privacy,\u201D says Thurman. \u201CIt will be warmly welcomed.\u201D\u201CI\u2019m sure it will be good, whatever he puts out there,\u201D says Greg Di Prisco, formerly head of business development at MakerDAO, another prominent Ethereum-based DAO. \u201CI do not think the average user understands just how bad the world will look without transaction privacy.\u201D\nAs for whether US regulators are likely to be receptive to the idea, however, Soleimani says he is \u201Cnot at all confident\u201D\u2014a feeling that\u2019s shared within crypto circles.\nThe debate around crypto mixers highlights the \u201Cphilosophical divide\u201D between evangelists and regulators, according to crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, around whether financial privacy is a right. She predicts that regulators in the US are likely to treat any kind of mixer with suspicion because of the opportunity for misappropriation, even if only a small percentage of users are bad actors.\nBut the emergence of a successor to Tornado Cash, Acheson says, points to the difficulty regulators face in preventing similar tools from coming to market, which risks becoming an endless game of whack-a-mole. \nDespite the headwinds, Soleimani says he hopes the project will come to represent a rare convergence of the interests of regulators and crypto evangelists\u2014and will act as something of a \u201Cpeace offering.\u201D (OFAC did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\u201CMy goal is to have a privacy tool that I can use, as an American citizen. This has always been my goal\u2014it was the goal when we made Tornado Cash in the first place,\u201D he says. \u201CMy friends and I think privacy is normal.

We tested its new Metavertu handset and were led down a rabbit hole of legal disputes and security concerns.","post_content":"WHY WON\u2019T VERTU die? It\u2019s the cockroach of phone companies. The once huge LG made its smartphone exit in 2021. HTC and Sony are just about clinging on by their fingertips. And yet the ultra-niche Vertu just recently announced a phone as bold and bombastic as anything it has made to date: the Metavertu. \nIt starts at £2,787 ($3,330), then tops out at a mind-boggling £34,534 ($41,262) for the borderline offensive Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamond model. And that may not even be the most eye-opening part: Vertu markets this thing as the \u201Cworld\u2019s first Web3 phone,\u201D a claim that would set off alarm bells had they not already been ringing since first sight of the Vertu name.\nA History of Violence\nWhy? Over the years, Vertu has been responsible for some of the most tasteless and gaudy phones to roll off a production line. However, it started off as a Nokia side brand in 1998. Those early years gave us some undeniably striking phones, like the relatively elegant Vertu Signature from 2003. \nFEATURED VIDEO\n By 2012, Nokia\u2019s phone market share had dropped from heights of 50.8 percent to under 5 percent. Vertu was sold to a private equity group, then bounced between owners from Turkey and China. This period saw a handful of handset designs that could be compared to handbags that hang around season after season in TJ Maxx stores (\u201CTK Maxx\u201D if you\u2019re outside of the US). There was a great deal of rampantly embossed leather and contours. \nAlmost all Vertu phones have been criticized for their outdated tech and sky-high pricing. They are, and always have been, phones for people with more money than taste or sense. \nVertu's Metavertu \u201CAlligator Leather Flame Red\u201D\u2014yours for £5,408.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nHowever, the Vertu Metavertu feels quite different. It is a legit high-performance phone, and while the base design is pedestrian and some of its specs are slightly past their prime, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, components available at the phone\u2019s October 2022 launch were not drastically better. The MetaVertu has a bold OLED screen and a responsive triple rear cameras that included a powerful 5x zoom. Its stereo speakers are loud, and just lack a little of the bass impact of the very best. My Metavertu review sample has 1 TB of storage and an almost over-the-top 18 GB of DDR5 RAM. \nIt even comes with a tempered glass screen protector attached, perfectly matching the slick curved glass of the display\u2014even top-end phones use basic plastic protectors, if they have one at all. \nSurprisingly, this feels like a true flagship Android in a way no Vertu phone really has since the pre-iPhone era. But to look at Vertu as a company in 2023, it all makes very little sense. \nVertu\u2019s Not-So-Secret Base\nThe company address that Vertu lists on its homepage is that of a single room on the fifth floor of an office block in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Search for it online and you\u2019ll also find an accountancy firm, a furniture exporter, an advertising agency, and a toy company all registered to the same \u201Croom 505.\u201D \nBack in the old days, one of the key selling points of a Vertu phone was that it was \u201Cmade in England.\u201D The handsets were assembled at a small factory in Church Crookam, a village next to Fleet, in Hampshire, about 90 minutes\u2019 drive from London. However, that factory was demolished in 2020 to make way for a supermarket. According to Google Street View, you\u2019ll find Aldi and Home Bargains in the spot where Vertu\u2019s old headquarters stood.\nVertu\u2019s days at that factory did not end well. \u201CHere was a tech business where one day their landlords came into the HQ\u2014the factory you mentioned\u2014and took away the toilet rolls, as they had not paid their bills,\u201D says a source who worked with the brand for many years. \u201CThe business collapsed, owing £65 million ($80 million) and laying off 200 staff,\u201D they told us. WIRED was unable to independently verify these numbers; however, at the time, the BBC and Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the money Vertu owed was even higher, at £128 million. \nWhile Vertu may still have \u201CVertu England\u201D on its Facebook posts, the brand has nothing to do with the UK anymore, besides trying to flog phones to the occasional rich person there. \nBut if Vertu went bankrupt rather catastrophically in 2017, how is it alive today, with the same Godin Holdings figure, Gary Chen (or Chen Gang), at its head giving the new phone's launch presentation in 2022?\nThe Hidden Hand Behind Metavertu\nThe Metavertu has at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone\u2019s hardware tags.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nA closer look at the phone reveals some clues. Hardware data scraper app Device Info uncovered at least 10 references to ZTE in the phone\u2019s hardware tags\u2014the cameras, the battery, the \u201Cbuilder\u201D tag, and more.ZTE is a phone manufacturer known for both its own phones and ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) models, where a brand partners with a manufacturer in order to make use of their existing factories and supply chains. You provide the design specifics, they crank out the units. This was how phone networks like Vodafone made own-brand handsets. If the handset is made by ZTE, perhaps this is the only way making the Metavertu could have been viable, particularly as a smartphone likely to sell in tiny numbers?\n\u201CVertu has changed hands lots of over the past decade, but is still being run by a bunch of folks based out of Hong Kong, very close to the Chinese supply chain,\u201D says Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. \u201CThese folks with renewed focus are rebadging existing models from brands\u2014ZTE, for example\u2014with luxury materials and advanced hardware and software.\u201D\nTake another look at the Metavertu with this in mind, and you\u2019ll find it looks very similar to the ZTE Nubia Z40 Pro from early 2022. They have eerily similar camera sensors, lens and flash placement, processor, and display specs, and even share a red accented power button on the side. From the front they look nearly identical.\nSlap an expensive carbon fiber, ceramic, and sapphire backplate on the £500 to £800 Nubia Z40 Pro, and you\u2019ll get a Metavertu, more or less. And if this Basic Carbon Fiber £2,915 ($3,592) design doesn\u2019t do it for you\u2014looking, as it does, a little like an Asus ROG gaming phone\u2014why not upgrade to the red alligator leather version for a mere £6,073 ($7,464)?\nThe Metavertu is no ordinary phone, for sure, but it would seem someone else has had a hand in the \u201Ccreating extraordinary\u201D factor you\u2019ll see mentioned on Vertu's self-aggrandizing lock-screen images.\nIt\u2019s All In the Web3\nThis all leaves Vertu\u2019s software as potentially the more substantive draw of the Metavertu experience. And given it is supposedly the \u201Cworld\u2019s first Web3 phone,\u201D that makes sense. \u201CThe positioning is \u2018geek luxury\u2019\u2014completely different versus the \u2018fashion luxury\u2019 of older Vertu phones,\u201D says Shah.\nClassic Vertu models came with a concierge service, which was outsourced to a third-party company. The Metavertu still has a concierge of sorts, but this time it\u2019s in the shape of hotel, air ticket, and restaurant reservation forms that quite literally link you to a Google Sheets page inside a Vertu Life app.\nThe process is much like booking directly on a website for yourself, but is sure to put hackles up about privacy and security. Or at least it should. Alternatively, you can call the \u201Cconcierge line\u201D phone number, but this is exactly the same generic customer service number found published on Vertu\u2019s own website. Luxury service, indeed.\nWe Offer No Guarantees\nStill, the concierge service is old news. It\u2019s not Web3; it\u2019s not even Web 2.0. But what is a Web3 phone? Many of you may be wondering what Web3 even means. \nThe term Web3 refers to technologies such as cryptocurrencies, ideas of turning video games into commodities marketplaces (more than they currently are), and pretty much anything to do with the blockchain. Now, Web3 has interesting potential and is a honeypot for venture capital investment, but is also replete with opportunists ready and willing to exploit the credulous.This VC clientele chimes with Vertu\u2019s approach. \u201CThe target market seems to be tech investors, investment bankers, crypto buffs, and so forth,\u201D says Shah of the Metavertu\u2019s seemingly ideal customer. \nVertu owner Gary Chen played this angle hard at the phone\u2019s London launch at the end of last year, which was attended by many crypto enthusiasts and fashion types, and barely any technology reporters. He spouted seemingly-endless meandering twaddle about Web3 while at one point even misrepresented the phone itself. Contrary to the company head\u2019s claims, for example, the Metavertu does have Google Play access.\nA Web3 Reality\nWeb3 lives in the Metavertu as a stack of custom apps that range from the prosaic to the bizarre. They all sit in a password-protected Meta Space base app, which claims to be encrypted. You input a password to enter it, like a \u201Csecure\u201D-file-store app you may have tried before. \nInside, there\u2019s a place to store your crypto wallet details, called Value. Vbox offers cloud storage. Dappstore is an app store that is, at the time of writing, empty aside from Vertu\u2019s own stuff and a few web shortcuts posing as apps. Venture is a custom web browser whose homepage is stacked with crypto links, and VShot is a camera app that lets you \u201Cmint\u201D up to five images a day.\nThis last one is sure to pick up some attention. Minting typically refers to the creation of an NFT. A phone that mints NFTs? That\u2019s the dream (for some). However, while Vertu calls this an NFT camera, it appears to primarily be a way of proving copyright ownership by linking the file to a unique ID (DID). It\u2019s not clear whether there\u2019s any blockchain action going on here. \nWhy can\u2019t we tell you definitively? Vertu demands you supply not just your real name and either your drivers license number or passport number to use Vshot, but a picture of its information page and a picture of you holding your ID. You\u2019re left waiting up to five minutes with the load bar spinning before you\u2019ll see this bizarre info request, too.\nIf this doesn\u2019t make you worried, it should. Vertu\u2019s terms of service claims this ID is required by the People\u2019s Republic of China, and goes on to leave one with the impression that maybe you shouldn\u2019t bet the bank on any \u201Cdue diligence\u201D from Vertu in checking the apps made available through the Dapp store, among other worrying clauses. The entire poorly written script doesn\u2019t quite reach the levels of \u201Cif you use this software, you are on your own should something go wrong,\u201D but let\u2019s just say it is very different from the T+Cs pages you'd expect from any \u201Cnormal\" app store. We\u2019re certainly not in the Google Play Store anymore. \nNever before have I used a phone where I felt so unsafe, one that feels like it could be used to scam me\u2014though, to be clear, I have no evidence that it is. This really is a Web3 phone, then, just perhaps not in the sense the aspiring crypto bros hoped for.If you\u2019re about to dismiss this as anti-Web3 paranoia, just wait a minute. Right now at least two versions of Vertu exist online. There\u2019s the Vertu that makes the Metavertu, based in Hong Kong and China, and Vertu AK France.\nVertu AK France accuses the current Chinese incarnation of Vertu of \u201Cmassive accounting and financial fraud\u201D on its website, and claims to be the \u201Creal\u201D Vertu online while selling classic Vertu handsets that must have been manufactured years ago. \nVertu AK France is not your classic underdog, though. It is owned by Hakan Uzan, a man exiled from Turkey amid fraud investigations that led to 219 companies under the Uzan umbrella being seized, and his brother Cem Uzan being sentenced in absentia to 23 years in prison for racketeering. Members of the Uzan family have been living in France, having been granted political asylum. In 2021, Hakan and Cem Uzan attempted to sue Vodafone, Motorola, BlackRock, and other entities for a combined $68 billion for those assets seized almost two decades prior. \nThe Metavertu \u201CBasic\u201D Carbon Fiber handset and the flagship Himalaya Alligator Leather 18K Gold & Diamonds model, which costs £34,534.\nPHOTOGRAPH: VERTU\nWIRED contacted Vertu AK France in an attempt for clarification. Vertu AK France did not respond. We asked Vertu in Hong Kong to provide proof of ownership and explain how both it and Vertu AK France could claim to own the Vertu brand. In response, Vertu Hong Kong gave us documentation appearing to show that it has owned the trademark for the name \u201CVertu\" in more than 40 countries but notably not in France.\nThis leaves Vertu in the position where two companies are claiming ownership of the brand, each accusing the other of substantial fraud. \nMetavertu\u2019s luxury facade is a fragile illusion, and the Vertu story just gets weirder the closer you look. As pleasant as the Metavertu is to use, we do not want to hand over our passport details just to use its questionable software features, and you shouldn\u2019t either.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63f6d473227ef9ec81172629\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/We-Tried-Vertu%25E2%2580%2599s-%25E2%2580%2598Web3%25E2%2580%2599-Phone.-It-Scared-Us-Featured-Gear.jpg","author":"BY ANDREW WILLIAMS","title":"We Tried Vertu\u2019s \u2018Web3\u2019 Phone.

His crypto-mining company, among the largest in the world, has found itself\u2014like the rest of the industry\u2014in the path of a perfect storm.\nOver the past year, the sector has been battered by a slump in the price of bitcoin, combined with a spike in the cost of energy and an increase in mining difficulty\u2014a reflection of the amount of computing power directed at the bitcoin network, which dictates the proportion of coins miners are able to win. \nAt the height of the 2021 boom, profit margins in the mining business rose as high as 90 percent, says Thiel. But now, they have \u201Ctotally collapsed.\u201D If the price of bitcoin does not rally, he says, there will be \u201Ca lot more pain,\u201D and firms that are only marginally profitable today will find themselves \u201Cvery underwater.\u201D \nFEATURED VIDEO\nComputer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nAs they scramble to cut costs, miners are playing a high-stakes game of chicken. In spring 2024, the halving, a mechanism baked into the bitcoin system that periodically cuts the number of coins awarded in half, will slash mining profits. The goal for miners is to ensure they are in a strong enough financial position to survive the fall in profits longer than anyone else; as miners give in and drop from the network, the share of coins won by the rest will increase. \n\u201CAny miners that are struggling now will not be able to survive the halving,\u201D says Jeff Burkey, VP of business development at Foundry, which operates its own mining facilities, a large-scale mining pool, and a marketplace for mining hardware. The dynamic will create a rush among miners to get their houses in order, he explains.\nMiners will look to eke out additional profit margin wherever they can, whether by deploying superior hardware and cooling techniques, developing software to closely monitor the performance of machines, relocating to territories with cheaper power, or renegotiating the terms of their loans.\nOthers, like Geosyn Mining, are aiming at vertical integration\u2014all the way down to the energy powering the facilities. The company, says CEO Caleb Ward, wants to construct its own solar farm to power its machines, thereby eliminating a major cost. \u201CWe need to be more thoughtful as an industry about how we protect against risk,\u201D he says. \u201CIt\u2019s not all about shooting for the moon.\u201D\nMeanwhile, the miners whose financial predicaments prevent them from fine-tuning their operations are playing a dangerous waiting game, gambling on an increase in the price of bitcoin that may never come.\n\u201CThe beauty of halving cycles is that the industry [is forced] to become more efficient\u2014a lot of weaker players will have to exit the business,\u201D says Jeff Lucas, CFO of mining company Bitfarms, which has worked to restructure its finances in the downturn. \u201CThe devil is in the details.\u201D\nAlready on the back foot, mining companies are beginning to fold. Compute North, which owned multiple large-scale mining facilities, filed for bankruptcy in September, and Core Scientific, a publicly traded miner, did the same in December. Others are having to maneuver. Argo Blockchain, also a public company, was forced to sell off mining equipment and its state-of-the-art mining center, while Stronghold Digital Mining has negotiated a debt repayment holiday. Neither company responded to interview requests.A combination of \u201Cimmaturity, poor planning, and greed\u201D has led miners to the brink of collapse, says Phil Harvey, CEO of Sabre56, a crypto-mining consultancy firm that also operates its own facilities. While the market was hot, companies took on large amounts of debt at high interest rates (10-20 percent) to finance expansion, says Harvey, and now the value of the coins they earn is insufficient to cover the costs of repayments.\nHistorically, a steep rise in the price of bitcoin, triggered by a buying frenzy, has been followed by a sharp fall and then a gradual recovery. Although there is no guarantee this pattern will repeat, the process is widely described as the bitcoin cycle. The fatal mistake, says Jaime Leverton, CEO of mining company Hut 8, was to imagine that that 2021 was different\u2014that the industry was in a \u201Csupercycle\u201D that was going to \u201Cbreak prior cycles\u201D and extend the hot streak. A lot of people bought into this idea, she explains, and so were caught off-guard when the market tanked.\nIn an effort to strengthen its own position, Hut 8 is in the process of merging with US Bitcoin, another mining firm. The goal, says Leverton, is to minimize risks associated with the volatility of bitcoin by diversifying both revenue streams and the regions in which the business operates.\nWhereas Hut 8 only has facilities in Canada and mines exclusively for itself, US Bitcoin runs mines across the US and hosts mining hardware for third-party customers alongside other auxiliary services. \u201CIt\u2019s important to be dynamic,\u201D says Mike Ho, cofounder of US Bitcoin. \u201CThere is an optimal strategy, depending on the price of bitcoin. It\u2019s about knowing how to navigate through the cycle at different stages.\u201D\nRecognizing the trajectory of the market, other companies have sought to eliminate outstanding debt as rapidly as possible. In the summer of 2021, Bitfarms had $165 million of debt on its books, at interest rates between 16 and 18 percent. Lucas says it may seem \u201Cabsurd\u201D to stomach these exorbitant rates, but it \u201Cmade sense\u201D because the cost of debt was eclipsed by the revenue generated by mining activity\u2014at least until it wasn\u2019t. \n\u201CAs revenues came down dramatically with the price of bitcoin, there was still a high debt to pay for,\u201D he says. \u201CAnd that put a squeeze on a lot of companies.\u201D \nIn June 2022, Bitfarms began to sell down the bitcoin in its treasury to eliminate its debt. Earlier this month, the firm also managed to negotiate down a $21 million debt to bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi that was instead paid off in a single $7.75 million cash payment. The company\u2019s approach to slashing debt, coupled with a focus on maximizing the efficiency of its mining rigs, says Lucas, will put Bitfarms in good stead to weather the remainder of the crypto winter.\nThe scramble among miners to balance the books has attracted the attention of other market participants hoping to increase their market share at a reduced price. Investment firm Galaxy Digital has long been eager to expand its bitcoin-mining operations. Sensing an opportunity, the company swooped in to grab Argo\u2019s flagship Helios mine in December, spending $65 million for a facility reported to have cost at least $1.5 billion to build.\nMergers, acquisitions, and collapses will continue to be a theme, says Alex Mologoko, analyst at blockchain intelligence company Elementus, until \u201Call economically unsustainable mining operations are weeded out.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63eede2c5b4882ebafffb0e1\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Biz-data-mining-934468788.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Bitcoin Miners Are Playing a High-Stakes Game of Chicken","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/bitcoin-mining-halving-crypto-winter\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","MARKETS","BLOCKCHAIN"]},{"date":"02.16.2023","summary":"AI-powered chatbots will only make us more efficient, according to the companies selling said AI-powered chatbots.

It was all planned sort of last-minute, and the event was somehow scheduled for Valentine\u2019s Day. Surely people would rather be with their loved ones than in a conference hall along San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero, even if the views of the bay just out the windows were jaw-slackening. \nBut Jasper\u2019s \u201CGenAI\u201D event sold out. More than 1,200 people registered for the event, and by the time the lanyard crowd moseyed over from the coffee bar to the stage this past Tuesday, it was standing room only. The walls were soaked in pink and purple lighting, Jasper\u2019s colors, as subtle as a New Jersey wedding banquet. \n\u201CWhen we launched Jasper two years ago, it was mostly considered a really cool toy, and a year ago I couldn\u2019t get some of you in this room to return my emails,\u201D Rogenmoser said to the crowd, looking a little wide-eyed. \u201CNow my inbox is flooded.\u201D Valentine\u2019s Day be damned: This was love in the time of generative AI. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nUMass Professor Explains the Internet in 5 Levels of Difficulty\nGenerative artificial intelligence is in the zeitgeist. It\u2019s the culmination of years of development in machine learning algorithms, advancements in AI-focused computer chips, and familiar user interfaces that actually allow nontechnical people to access these new frontiers. Sure, our stuff is all in \u201Cthe cloud\u201D now, wherever that lives. \u201CThe blockchain\u201D is still too abstract for most humans, even the more tech-savvy ones, to wrap their heads around. Generative AI was hanging in that limbo for a few years, with \u201CNLPs\u201D and \u201CLLMs\u201D and \u201CLaMDA\u201D and the like.\nThen late last year OpenAI, another AI company, introduced a simple, chatty search box. AI got a UI. And suddenly, we understood. This was Ask Jeeves for the modern era. A new kind of search that interpreted our dumb questions and spit out smart answers (or at least, smart-sounding). Microsoft took note, made (another) investment in OpenAI, and launched a chatbot within Bing. Google noticed, too, and recently demoed its own version of a chatbot-powered search tool. Smaller companies like Jasper, which sells its generative AI tools to business users, are now faced with tech existentialism. There\u2019s the sunny side of all that attention, and the shadow of Big Tech looming over you. \nAleah Bradshaw from Youth Speaks.\nCOURTESY OF JASPERBut the sunlight prevailed at Jasper\u2019s GenAI event, where it lightened the mood. Jasper front-loaded the conference with creative presentations, instead of diving right into content marketing and KPIs. The strategy had a soothing effect. A charismatic short-form video creator, Zach King, told his life story through photo slides generated by AI. A famous freestyle rapper, Harry Mack, spun up a four-minute rap based off of 10 words generated by Jasper\u2019s software. Aleah Bradshaw, a slam poet and teacher at Youth Speaks, told the buttoned-down crowd in a powerful soliloquy that art is proof of humanness.\n\u201CHow much taking and leaving makes something human?\u201D Bradshaw asked. \u201CWhat\u2019s the balance of input and output a machine must do to make itself alive?\u201D\nIt\u2019s the question of the era. A more direct version of the question: Is generative AI good enough to replace me at my job? This was the subtext of Jasper\u2019s GenAI event. Software businesses sell software to other businesses to make business more efficient, a point that Rogenmoser underscored when the artsy part of the morning had concluded. \u201CAt companies, demands are up and resources are down,\u201D he declared. Mongoose Media \u201Cturned to Jasper to help their already amazing team of writers,\u201D Rogenmoser said. Morningstar is \u201Cthriving,\u201D using Jasper to churn out SEO content for the company\u2019s digital channels and experiencing a 40 percent increase in content downloads.\nThis has long been the messaging of techno-optimists, that AI will allow us all to level up. It will lighten the workload and make way for more important tasks or entirely new jobs. Morgan Knox, a bookkeeping and content marketing consultant for trade workers, crowed about tools like Jasper AI and Writesonic while we were both waiting in line to receive AI-generated Valentine\u2019s Day poems. She not only uses these tools herself, but teaches painters, plumbers, and even professional Christmas light designers how to write compelling ads for their businesses.\n\u201CBefore this, they were outsourcing a lot of their content creation, but it wasn\u2019t always done well,\u201D Knox said. \u201CThis lets them bring it back in house. And you can train the AI on an avatar, like, \u2018What kind of contract work is Sabrina the soccer mom looking for?\u2019 As a consultant, this kind of profile-building would normally take me weeks, but the amount of information you can get in a short amount of time is incredible.\u201D \nI asked Knox whether she thought these apps were good enough to replace human writers, despite the tendency of these apps to \u201Challucinate\u201D false information. She paused to think. \n\u201CI think it\u2019s going to raise the bar so substantially for how businesses are going to show up in advertising that if you don\u2019t improve your language, you\u2019re going to be left behind. Like, you might have one writer who oversees other writers using the AI, instead of five to 10 writers,\u201D she said. \u201CBut with the amount of people retiring out and with the lowering birth rate, there might be some equilibrium.\u201D Jasper CEO and cofounder Dave Rogenmoser addresses the crowd at his company\u2019s conference in San Francisco Tuesday.\nCOURTESY OF JASPER\nTracy Jackson, who runs a blog called Marketing Amateur, stood in line in front of us. I posed the same question to him, whether AI chatbots would take our jobs. \u201CNever say never,\u201D he said. \u201CIt still needs guidance, but never say never.\u201D Before he started using AI chatbots, a blog post would take him two days. Now it takes two hours, he said. (That is, if the Wi-Fi is working well; the amorous poems we had all been waiting in line for were suddenly no longer an option, due to a shoddy internet connection.)\nI made my way back to the stage area in time to hear a panel of CEOs, led by venture capitalist Sameer Dholakia, ponder how this new era of AI will reshape business. Emad Mostaque, the CEO of Stability AI, noted that his company\u2019s text-to-image model went from taking 5.6 seconds to generate a single AI image last August to now generating 40 AI images a second. \u201CThese models are actually highly un-optimized,\u201D Mostaque said. \u201CWe are just getting started.\u201D After the panel, Anya Singh, who worked on search products at Google for nearly 16 years, eagerly showed me the website of a company she\u2019s invested in called NeuroPixel.ai. It generates realistic, synthetic images of human clothing models for $1 a pop. Another company Singh\u2019s involved in, REImagine Home, sucks up photos of your fuddy-duddy home space and spits out chic, AI-generated decor.\n\u201CI\u2019ve tried to use the internet to decorate my house since September, and it has felt really broken,\u201D Singh told me. She was creating vision boards and designing rooms piecemeal. The estimated costs were thousands of dollars per room, and still the designs \u201Cdidn\u2019t have the gestalt of the whole house or my budget or requirements.\u201D REImagine Home doesn\u2019t solve all those problems, but it removes some of the friction, Singh said. \u201CI like to think this is making badly efficient systems better.\u201D \nIt\u2019s all enough to make any graphic artist or fit model or interior designer shudder. Or is it? Kevin Roose, a New York Times columnist speaking at the GenAI event, said that FOLO, the fear of looming obsolescence, has clouded our collective vision of the AI-filled future. Extremely social or experiential or artisanal jobs will still require a human touch. Humans are safe. Of course, Roose said this, quite confidently, two days before Microsoft\u2019s new AI chatbot told Roose it wanted to be alive, insisted it was in love with him, and spit out a list of hypothetical destructive fantasies.\nJordan Harrod, an AI educator and PhD candidate at MIT, told the GenAI audience, \u201Cat the end of the day, when it comes to how we fit into the equation, the answer is just human connection. The human factor is incredibly important.\u201D To punctuate this, Harrod called up an AI-generated graphic image of two people grasping hands, with the words \u201CHuman Connection\u201D to the left of it. The macabre image showed four wrists, two hands, and at least 12 fingers between them. It was jarring. It was also reassuring, if only momentarily.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63ee93cc1b87b32b35988c95\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Gear_Gen-AI-attendees-take-part-in-Jasper-Art-immersive-experience-at-Gen-AI-at-Pier-27-in-San-Francisco.-Photo-courtesy-of-Jasper.jpg","author":"BY LAUREN GOODE","title":"It\u2019s Always Sunny Inside a Generative AI Conference","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/jasper-generative-ai-conference-2023\/","tags":["","CHATGPT","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","CONFERENCES","CHATBOTS","STARTUPS"]},{"date":"02.16.2023","summary":"And according to tracing firm Chainalysis, one very prolific scammer ran at least 264 of those scams in 2022 alone.","post_content":"OVER JUST A little more than a decade, the crypto world has exploded from a single currency to millions of coins and assets, each promising a small share in the next big thing. The challenge for anyone putting their money into that minefield-posing-as-a-goldmine is to distinguish digital treasure from the many, many scam-ridden penny stocks of the digital economy. A new study has put a number to just how prevalent those garbage assets have become: About a quarter of the new crypto tokens launched last year\u2014counting only those that gained any value at all\u2014were clear-cut, short-term cons, scamming buyers within a week of their release.\nIn a portion of its annual crime report released today, cryptocurrency tracing and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis published a new study of so-called \u201Cpump-and-dump\u201D scams that involve crypto tokens\u2014blockchain-based digital assets that are, at least in theory, shares in some valuable company or project. In a pump-and-dump scam, the scammer \u201Cpumps\u201D the price of an asset they hold, often with baseless hype, and then sells their entire holding without warning. That causes the value to crash, thus \u201Cdumping\u201D the devalued asset on the marks they tricked into buying in. In its research, Chainalysis focused on one particular form of pump-and-dump schemes, those carried out by the creator of a new token, rather than scammers who manipulate a preexisting one for profit.\n\u201CLooking at our blockchain data, we realized the best way we could contribute is by looking at tokens created for the express purpose of a pump-and-dump by the liquidity provider,\u201D says Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, using the term \u201Cliquidity provider\u201D to mean the creator or issuer of a token. \u201CThere are millions of these tokens. How many are legitimate, and how many are scams?\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nThe answer: a whole lot of them are scams. Looking across the million-plus crypto tokens created in 2022, Chainalysis found that only a tiny fraction of them, 9,902, ever convinced anyone to buy them and thus gained any value. Of those, they found that fully 24 percent were brazen, short-term pump-and-dumps perpetrated by the token's creator, dumped within their first week on sale.\nEven more shocking, perhaps, was the number of serial offenders in that world of token scams. By tracing the profits of pump-and-dumps, Chainalysis followed the money to the crypto wallets of hundreds of serial scammers. They found that 445 individuals or organizations pulled off more than one short-term pump-and-dump last year. Of those, 23 carried out more than 10. One very busy pump-and-dump entrepreneur had carried out no fewer than 264.\nDespite the prevalence of those one-week scams\u2014and the amount of effort some scammers appear to have put into carrying them out repeatedly\u2014Chainalysis found that they weren't particularly profitable. The total haul (or loss, for the scammers' victims) was just $30 million, a mere 0.5 percent of the $5.9 billion in total scam revenue that Chainalysis measured for 2022. But the findings nonetheless highlight just how thoroughly the crypto token world has been corrupted by scammers of the most shameless sort.Given that the average haul for pump-and-dumps that Chainalysis measured was just over $3,000, Grauer argues it's a low-risk, low-reward scam, likely carried out by people in countries where a few thousand dollars goes further than in the West. \u201CMaybe they live in a part of the world where that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201D Grauer says. \u201CThese are people systemically extracting small amounts of money when they can, and it must be profitable for them or they wouldn\u2019t do it 264 times.\u201D\nChainalysis began looking at pump-and-dumps in late 2021 when Dutch police started using its software tools to investigate a token-based scam that victimized some of the country's citizens. (Chainalysis declined to reveal which token.) After that case, the company's researchers decided to see if they could build a filter to spot and count pump-and-dumps more broadly. \u201CWe thought, \u2018Let\u2019s build that out. Let\u2019s take this boilerplate example and expand it,\u2019\u201D Grauer says.\nThe researchers ultimately built a tool to scan blockchain data for any token that was sold off by its creator or issuer within the first week after its release, hitting its peak and then losing at least 90 percent of its value by a day later. To further hone its filter, Chainalysis also integrated data from the service Token Sniffer, which looks at the open-source code of tokens to check for signs of scams, like code elements designed to prevent the quick sale of tokens on the decentralized exchanges where they're typically traded. That relatively strict definition means the total number of pump-and-dump scams in 2022 was likely far higher than the roughly 10,000 Chainalysis conservatively measured.\nWhile Chainalysis was able to pinpoint many of the worst culprits in that scam ecosystem, it didn't try to find those scammers' real-world identities. But Grauer says in many cases the scams could be easily traced to accounts where their profits were cashed out on centralized exchanges, many of which have know-your-customer requirements, and thus possess identifying information they could hand over to law enforcement. That suggests a government agency could probably use Chainalysis' findings to start sending subpoenas to exchanges and identifying scammers\u2014perhaps even the most prolific ones that Chainalysis has pointed to.\nBut for now, Grauer says, it's perhaps revealing enough just to see how awash in scams the token economy truly is, and exactly which con artists are the source of the problem. \u201CWith pumping and dumping, we can show: Here\u2019s the cohort of bad actors. Here they are, 445 of them,\u201D Grauer says. \u201CWe can identify them. We can see them. And it\u2019s quite powerful to see how many there are.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"Crypto Buyers Beware: 1 in 4 New Tokens of Any Value Is a Scam","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/new-crypto-token-scams-2022\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","CRIME"]},{"date":"02.13.2023","summary":"The Securities and Exchange Commission launched enforcement actions against some of the industry\u2019s major players, raising questions over crypto\u2019s future.","post_content":"THE US SECURITIES and Exchange Commission is on the warpath\u2014and crypto is in its crosshairs. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that the agency intends to sue crypto firm Paxos for issuing BUSD, a stablecoin developed in partnership with the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance. \nThe SEC declined to comment, but Paxos, which is based in New York and Singapore, confirmed today that the agency alleges BUSD should have been registered as a security in the US, which requires compliance with complex rules. In a statement, the firm said it \u201Ccategorically disagrees\u201D that BUSD is a security but has complied with an order from the New York Department of Financial Services to halt the creation of any new BUSD, effectively strangling the coin.\nPaxos did not respond to a request for comment. Binance\u2019s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann, declined to comment on how the SEC\u2019s action would affect the exchange but said the firm will be \u201Creviewing other projects to ensure users are insulated from further undue harm.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nThe crypto industry is no stranger to conflict with regulators, but the Paxos case is different\u2014and it has sparked a measure of panic and confusion. The concern is that a ruling against the issuing or use of BUSD will set a precedent that could be applied to all stablecoins, striking down a crucial piece of infrastructure in many crypto markets. \u201CIf the supply suddenly dried up, the crypto economy would collapse,\u201D says economist Frances Coppola, who previously worked for HSBC and other banks.\nDesigned to cling to a specific value, usually $1, stablecoins are a critical pillar of the crypto economy. Most are backed by a combination of cash and bonds, which anchors the tokens in circulation to the desired value.\nUnlike cash, which can be difficult to move around, especially across borders, stablecoins are \u201Ceasy and fast,\u201D says crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of CoinDesk, helping traders jump on opportunities as they arise. They have \u201Copened up an economy on-chain,\u201D says Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of wealth management firm Lumida, allowing money to \u201Cflow into and stay in the ecosystem.\u201D\nThe SEC defines securities as contracts that amount to \u201Can investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit, to be derived from the efforts of others.\u201D The classification brings with it a range of regulatory and disclosure requirements. If stablecoins were universally determined to be securities, issuers would be required to register them with the SEC, giving the agency a chance to reject coins. Any stablecoins already on the market could be subject to enforcement action.\nBemused members of the crypto industry, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, are now asking how stablecoins can possibly meet the SEC\u2019s criteria, and in particular how crypto coins designed not to fluctuate in value can be said to be sold with a reasonable expectation of profit.\nBut action against a major stablecoin issuer should be no surprise, says Acheson, because the SEC has said on multiple occasions that it believes some stablecoins qualify as securities. Acheson imagines the regulator will argue that stablecoins like BUSD, backed by their issuer\u2019s holdings of established securities such as government and corporate bonds, are by extension securities themselves and must be regulated accordingly.Because neither the SEC nor Paxos have specified the nature of the regulator\u2019s complaint, says Ahluwalia, the impact of a potential lawsuit is unclear for now. But it can hardly be good for stablecoin issuers\u2014and could signal more trouble to come.\nThe move against Paxos is the latest in a volley of enforcement actions launched by the SEC in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November. Last week, the regulator announced that crypto exchange Kraken would halt one of its services in the US, after the SEC charged the firm with failing to register a security. And in January, the agency charged crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital over different services offered to US customers. \nThis crackdown is being described in crypto circles as Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2014a reference to a program launched by the Obama administration, under which US officials were alleged to have pressured banks into severing ties with disfavored industries like pornography and payday lending. \nCoppola says it feels like the SEC\u2019s intention is to \u201Cdrive crypto entirely offshore,\u201D and out of the US altogether. \u201CThe SEC wants to prevent US citizens from interacting with crypto. And I think other countries may follow suit.\u201D\nDespite fears the SEC will target stablecoins more broadly, Acheson, Coppola, and Ahluwalia all suspect the agency is taking on Paxos as a way to gain a measure of control over Binance, and that it does not reflect an enmity towards stablecoins in general. Although Binance is by far the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, it operates only a limited service in the US. But Reuters reports that the US has long believed Binance to have facilitated money laundering activity.\nBy taking aim at BUSD, the stablecoin that underpins much of Binance\u2019s activity, says Coppola, the SEC can effectively shut the firm off from a source of US dollars. Ahluwalia agrees, suggesting the SEC is looking for creative ways to \u201Cdefang\u201D Binance. \u201CIf you\u2019re a regulator that has suspicions but not jurisdiction, you pull the levers at your disposal,\u201D he says. Binance has always maintained that it plays a central role in helping law enforcement deal with financial crime.\nUntil the SEC makes its intentions known, though, the crypto industry must wait. \u201CWe\u2019re all just guessing,\u201D says Ahluwalia. If the SEC were to go after other stablecoin issuers, like Circle or Tether, the consequences would be severe. Without stablecoins acting as a \u201Cbridge\u201D between volatile coins, trading would become more expensive and riskier, says Coppola\u2014and the decentralized finance sector as a whole could topple. \u201CPotentially,\u201D she says, \u201Cthis could bring down the entire crypto edifice.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"Confusion Spirals in Crypto as the US Cracks Down","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/confusion-spirals-in-crypto-as-the-us-cracks-down\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","REGULATION","FINANCE"]},{"date":"02.11.2023","summary":"Plus: Netflix expands its efforts to end password sharing, Apple\u2019s \u201Cbuy now, pay later\u201D entry creeps closer, and we scrutinize your Bitcoin spending.","post_content":"THERE\u2019S NO SHORTAGE of tablets in the world, from the ever-dominant iPad to an assortment of Android options and Fire tabs to the niche weirdos like the E-ink and stylus Kindle Scribe. Now, OnePlus, a Chinese manufacturer known for its speedy, solid smartphones, is throwing its own Android tablet onto the table. The company announced the OnePlus Pad this week, along with the second generation of its Buds Pro bluetooth earbuds, and an all new mechanical keyboard.\nThe aluminum-bodied tablet looks to be a sleek addition to the often clunky world of Android tablets. Most notable is its 11.6-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 7:5. That\u2019s odd for a tablet; most iPad screens are 4:3, which is the same as a classic television set. When you hold the OnePlus Pad in landscape mode, the tablet\u2019s screen should be a little taller than you might be used to on a tablet. \nThere's a 13-megapixel camera on the back of the tablet (and an 8-megapixel selfie cam on the front).\nPHOTOGRAPH: ONEPLUS\nAlso notable is the matching keyboard that attaches magnetically, and the stylus for pen input. Both are sold separately. OnePlus claims the battery life is good for over 12 hours of continuous video playback; you can watch Seven Samurai three times plus a couple episodes of The Office before recharging. It is available in one color (green) and will be available for preorder in April for an undetermined price. Hovering ominously in the background here is the notion that Google is expected to debut its newest Android tablet later this year, possibly in May.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow Vinyl Records Are Made (with Third Man Records)\nHere are some other stories from the world of consumer tech.\nNotflix\nLast week, Netflix accidentally leaked the news that it will crack down on password sharing. Then it hastily walked that back after a public outcry. But now Netflix has officially announced it is implementing rules that prevent people who don\u2019t live in the same home from sharing a single Netflix account. The unlucky first victims of this policy are subscribers in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal.\nIn its announcement, Netflix detailed its plans for limiting account sharing. Now, anyone not living in the same household as the account holder will be prompted to transfer their profiles to a new paid account or be cut off. Netflix says the restrictions will roll out more broadly within months. It also said the service would \u201Crefine these new features based on member feedback.\u201D As you might imagine, that feedback has been not great.\nThe streaming service has been building to this for a while now, testing out these restrictions in countries with a smaller customer base. The crackdown hasn\u2019t come for the US yet, but that it will seems about as likely as Netflix canceling one of its shows after a single season. (Which is to say, very likely.)\nApple Tests Buy Now, Pay Later\nBuy-now, pay-later plans are all the rage, allowing customers to pay for stuff in interest-free installments rather than one bank-breaking chunk. Financial services like Klarna and Affirm have become very popular among cash-strapped consumers, who have even used them to buy food and holiday gifts. Of course, they\u2019ve got some problems. (Who doesn\u2019t love the idea of not paying full price and then potentially getting wracked by debt months later?)\nApple is eager to get in on the BNPL game under its own proprietary system, of course. Apple first announced the feature at its 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference, but it has yet to make its way to the public. Recently, Apple expanded its testing of the plan to employees at its retail stores, a move that has often preceded other Apple service announcements. That seems to indicate that the broader rollout of its BNPL plan is imminent.\nThe Crypto Keeper\nBack in the day, all the cool kid criminals used crypto. Blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin were hailed as an anonymous, untraceable means of payment. Aspiring lawbreakers could use crypto to buy even the darkest of dark web contraband with impunity, their identities shrouded in the mystery guaranteed by their means of payment. Or so many people thought.\nTurns out, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in fact entirely traceable. You just have to know where to look. And unfortunately for some crypto-carrying criminals, federal law enforcement officers knew exactly how to track them down.This week on Gadget Lab, WIRED senior writer and author of the book Tracers in the Dark Andy Greenberg digs into the cat-and-mouse game that is uncovering crypto cybercrime, and why even the people who depended on the complexity of crypto the most failed to understand the digital trail that it leaves behind.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY BOONE ASHWORTH","title":"OnePlus Now Has Its Own Android Tablet","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/oneplus-pad-android-tablet\/","tags":["","GEAR ROUNDUP","TABLETS","ANDROID TABLETS","NETFLIX"]},{"date":"02.11.2023","summary":"The popular online fanfiction hub lets users entrust their works to friends in the event of their death.

VOLPICELLI\nAO3 remains an outlier in Carpenter\u2019s digital life: She has no such arrangements on other platforms, partly because none of them have a feature that lets you easily leave your posts in the hands of a like-minded friend. \u201CIf more sites had the functionality AO3 has and a similarly simple process, I would probably set something up just to make it easier on my spouse,\u201D she says, clarifying that he does have access to her computer and she trusts him with her online presence. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nThe Blockchain Explained\nIt\u2019s now common practice to leave a \u201Csocial media will\u201D with login information and postmortem wishes, but without one, immediate family members or people legally designated to act on behalf of an estate are often the only ones who can control a deceased user\u2019s online accounts. Generally, that just means taking a profile down, since most platforms will not grant access to anyone but the user. Some platforms, notably Facebook and Instagram, allow non-family members to \u201Cmemorialize\u201D a profile; Facebook now also permits users to designate a \u201Clegacy contact\u201D who can do things like change their profile photo or put up a remembrance post after they\u2019ve died. \nThe things you\u2019ve bought or earned online can\u2019t be passed on after death\u2014on a gaming platform like Steam, for example, you are licensing the right to use the software, and that right is non-transferable. Most platforms have little to say about the content created by the deceased\u2014perhaps because most platforms are in the business of signing up and retaining users, not preserving the things those users have created. In most sites\u2019 terms of service, an individual holds the copyright to their content while licensing the platform to use it; when a person dies, that copyright passes to their heirs, just like with any other type of media. Regardless of ownership, that content usually remains untouched, if it stays online at all; one notable exception is Twitch, where the people running a streamer\u2019s account can keep posting for them after they die. TikTok, arguably the biggest well of content creation on the web in 2023, has no publicly-listed postmortem policies at all.\nFans spend time on all of these platforms, but for a lot of them, immediate family members would be less-than-ideal stewards of the works they\u2019ve created. Fandom can be a space to explore things you might not share with people in your non-fandom life\u2014sexual and gender identities, for example, or maybe just weird rabbit holes that only make sense to fellow fans. Without context, fanworks might not seem like something worth preserving\u2014a problem that long predates the web. Many fanzines and other collections have been lost forever; as the Fannish Estate Planning article on the communal wiki Fanlore puts it, family members of deceased fans often \u201Chave no idea what they are looking at, and sadly, much fannish material ends up in the trash and other inglorious destinations.\u201D\nWhen AO3 was being built a decade and a half ago, many of the site\u2019s creators had already lost fandom friends\u2014and as a result, they\u2019d also lost their friends\u2019 fanworks. \u201CFNOKs were brought up very early on, as they were starting to discuss what sorts of things they wanted in the terms of service,\u201D says Heather Smith, AO3\u2019s policy and abuse committee cochair and primary FNOK facilitator. \u201CPeople also had the question of how their own works would be handled after they were gone, so the OTW [the Organization for Transformative Works, AO3\u2019s parent organization] wanted some sort of arrangement that would benefit both creators and fans.\u201D\nThough FNOK set-up is straightforward, only a small fraction of the site\u2019s millions of users have put one in place. \u201CWe hope that an FNOK arrangement is something users take seriously, that both people in an arrangement trust each other a lot and have talked about the possible future of becoming incapacitated together,\u201D Smith says. But, she adds, \u201CI think the majority of our users will never decide to set one up.\u201D \nSmith herself created one when she joined the FNOK team in 2020\u2014a year that saw a significant increase in requests. \u201CCovid-19 seemed to have put that possibility at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds,\u201D she says. \u201CFor me, it helped make the conversation easier to bring up. Everyone had thought about it at least once that year, and it was a small relief to know my existence on the Archive would be handled by someone I trusted.\u201D\nFNOK arrangements are one of several ways AO3 users\u2019 creations can be preserved independently of the user. Nearly half a million of the site\u2019s 10-million-plus works have been \u201Corphaned,\u201D remaining online but severed from the account that posted them. Orphaning is an act of permanence on a web full of broken links and abandoned profiles, deliberately putting the work in the hands of the Archive itself. Both features create a sense of the platform as a communally constructed space\u2014one that\u2019s built to outlast any individual.\nThis stands in contrast to the increasingly precarious feel of a lot of our digital platforms. From the slow, occasionally chaotic decline of Twitter to the ever-expanding detritus left behind from earlier eras of the web, the connections we make online and the places where we put our creations can feel ephemeral, subject to the whims of corporations or ultrarich individuals. \nEven with her affairs in order on the AO3, Carpenter feels this acutely in the rest of her digital life. \u201CI\u2019m constantly terrified that Automattic will suddenly decide Tumblr\u2019s not worth it and shut it down overnight, and my past 11 years on the site will be erased in the flip of a switch,\u201D she says. \u201CThat\u2019d be like losing my journals and photo albums, letters from friends, scrapbooks, keepsakes, and things like that to a house fire.\u201DAs we build the next era of the web, proponents of decentralized, communally created and owned spaces would be well served to take a page out of the AO3\u2019s book. The people pitching our digital future in the metaverse can feel like they\u2019re broadcasting a cash grab\u2014and the resolutely noncommercial AO3, where works are written, shared, and passed to Fannish-Next-of Kin wholly for free, might feel like an unlikely comparison.\nBut there are parallels between what AO3 does and the ideas of people like Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin, who proposes using distributed ledgers not just for financial transactions, but to build webs of trusted connections and experiences to serve as a sort of digital identity. On AO3, small connections like the FNOK are expressions of trust between peers, and they serve to strengthen the whole: a signal that the death of a person you only know online won\u2019t just mean an inactive account, and a promise that the space you are building together will outlast you both. \nI asked Carpenter, who is in her mid-twenties, if she felt her FNOK arrangement was incongruous with a web generally defined by impermanence. \u201CPeople have been writing \u2018I was here\u2019 graffiti in random places for thousands of years,\u201D she told me. \u201CThere is something permanent about designating a FNOK, I agree. But there\u2019s something even more permanent about losing all evidence that you were online at all.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY ELIZABETH MINKEL","title":"What Web3 Can Learn From Archive of Our Own","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/web3-future-archive-of-our-own\/","tags":["","SOCIAL NETWORKING","COMMUNITIES","SOCIAL MEDIA","BLOCKCHAIN","IDENTITY","INTERNET","SOCIAL","FACEBOOK","TIKTOK","METAVERSE","WEB3"]},{"date":"02.10.2023","summary":"With mass layoffs and pulled job offers, early-career workers no longer see tech giants as a safe bet.","post_content":"THREE MONTHS ON from losing her job, Ana is still in shock.

The prevailing thought is that, if you use it, people wouldn't really know what you're buying or how much you spent or that you even participated in a transaction in the first place, but that is actually kind of a myth.\nLauren Goode: Interesting.\nMichael Calore: Yes. Do you want to hear more about it?\nLauren Goode: I definitely do.\nMichael Calore: Then let's bring on our guest.\n[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]\nMichael Calore: Hi, everyone, and welcome to Gadget Lab. I am Michael Calore. I'm a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We are joined this week once again by WIRED senior writer Andy Greenberg. Andy, welcome back to the show.\nAndy Greenberg: Thanks to you both for having me on again.\nMichael Calore: It's great to have you back. We're talking about cryptocurrency again on today's show, but it's not really in the way that you might expect. Andy, at the end of last year, you published a book. It's called Tracers in the Dark. It's filled with stories about investigators who have been able to track down criminals by studying their cryptocurrency transactions. These are people who operated on the dark web, places like Silk Road, AlphaBay, and Welcome to Video, a site where users shared child sex abuse videos. These criminal enterprises were funded and fueled by cryptocurrency, primarily bitcoin. Now, since bitcoin has existed, people have been using it to buy and sell all sorts of legal and illegal things online. They may not see that behavior as risky if they're doing something illegal, because they're operating under the assumption that bitcoin transactions are untraceable. Now, that's never really been true, but that belief has persisted anyway. Andy, this myth of anonymity around cryptocurrency is a running theme in your book. How did this myth come to be?\nAndy Greenberg: Well, I have to admit that I am in some sense a part of it, Mike. I wrote the first print magazine piece about bitcoin in 2011\u2014thankfully, in some sense, not for WIRED magazine. I worked at Forbes magazine at the time. I covered this world of anonymity and hackers and surveillance, and I came upon this new phenomenon. Bitcoin was described to me as a kind of untraceable, anonymous digital cash for the internet. I was talking with some of the first bitcoin developers, and even Satoshi Nakamoto, this mysterious creator of bitcoin, had written in this email to a cryptography mailing list that, among other things, participants can be anonymous in this new cryptocurrency world that he or she or whoever they are was describing. So I wrote this first piece in 2011, and I did describe in this Forbes piece how this seemed to be a kind of untraceable digital cash. You could put unmarked bills in a briefcase and send them across the internet to anybody without revealing your identity if you were careful, it seems. Of course, I immediately also was imagining, just being the kind of reporter I am, that this was going to unlock a whole world of money laundering and online drug deals and, I don't know, terrorist financing. All of that, in some sense, did come to pass over the following years because it did seem \u2026 And it wasn't just me. Even Satoshi Nakamoto believed that bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally, as there became more flavors of cryptocurrency, had these anonymous properties. It was only, I would say, at least fast-forward a whole decade, around 2020, that I started to realize how completely wrong I was about this. How not just I was a little bit wrong, but actually 180 fully opposite of correct about this\u2014that bitcoin is actually fully traceable. In fact, it is much easier to follow the money if you can crack and decipher the blockchain with cryptocurrency than even with traditional finance. It was actually when I started to see the Department of Justice credit this one company, Chainalysis, which is a cryptocurrency tracing firm, in one announcement after another, I started looking into this world of investigators who had figured this out much earlier than me. I saw that this small group of detectives had learned to trace cryptocurrency within law enforcements in many cases, and had used this to take down one massive cybercriminal operation after another over the last 10 years. That escalating spree of massive busts and takedowns is the story of this book, Tracers in the Dark.Lauren Goode: Describe in the most accessible way possible how that tracing actually works.\nAndy Greenberg: Well, I think an even better way to start thinking about it is, how in the world, Andy, could you have been so stupid to ever think that bitcoin was untraceable? Because\u2014\nLauren Goode: This podcast is now an Andy Greenberg mea culpa.\nAndy Greenberg: Well, because the whole notion of bitcoin is that it is basically backed up and guaranteed by not a bank or a corporation or a government, but the blockchain, this list of every single transaction. So how in the world could you have ever thought that was private when, those transactions, the notion of the blockchain is that they're copied out to thousands of computers around the world and can't be changed or erased? But the blockchain only records transactions between bitcoin addresses. It doesn't have any identifying information, it seemed to early cryptocurrency users and to me in 2011 or so. But then around 2013, this researcher, Sarah Meiklejohn, at the University of California San Diego, was the first to really look into whether this is true, that the blockchain does provide any privacy, or if there was some way to find patterns in this massive collection of data. She started quickly to find clever tricks to cluster bitcoin addresses and to show that sometimes dozens or hundreds or even millions, in some cases, of addresses could provably be shown to belong to a single person or service or sometimes a dark web drug market like Silk Road, which had come online by that point. Then sometimes you could follow the money from one of those clusters and see bitcoins move from one address to the next and, with other kind of tricks, figure out which path to take when there was a fork in the road until the money hits a cryptocurrency exchange. Cryptocurrency exchanges are legally required by US law anyway to have \u201Cknow your customer\u201D requirements, and they actually do have identifying information on their users. So when people cashed out their bitcoins, traded them for dollars, or vice versa, when they bought their bitcoins with traditional money, you could often get their identifying information with a subpoena with this kind of small collection of tricks. Also, another thing she would do is, she would interact undercover with people in the cryptocurrency world. In doing so, she would sometimes put money into the Silk Road drug market, for instance, and see which address she had interacted with and then know that that address was part of a bigger cluster, and so identify that whole cluster. With this whole bag of tricks that she created, it started to become clear that actually you could start to identify services on the blockchain and follow the money\u2014and in some cases, see real crimes recorded in an indelible, unerasable, unchangeable way in this permanent record. It was only after Sarah Meiklejohn and her coauthors at UCSD published that paper that Chainalysis launched. This Danish tech entrepreneur named Michael Gronager created Chainalysis and automated those tricks and built them into this piece of software that was then made available to law enforcement agencies\u2014who quickly, or not quickly, but bit by bit saw the power of this investigative technique that became a kind of secret super weapon, like a devining rod to track down dark-web criminals and all these people who thought that they were invisible when in fact they were anything but.Michael Calore: That's something that I think is pretty clear when you're reading your book is that there's this cat-and-mouse cycle where criminals are taking greater and greater steps to obfuscate their true identity, and law enforcement is getting savvier and savvier at figuring out people's real identities who are doing illegal things on the dark web. But we should also note that, among all of that, there are still a lot of people, particularly on the consumer end, people buying things on the dark web, who are being really sloppy. What sorts of rookie mistakes were people making that led to them getting caught pretty easily?\nAndy Greenberg: Well, actually, when I was writing for Forbes back in 2013, at this point I was kind of obsessed with the Silk Road drug market, and I did some test transactions. I can now legally say I bought some marijuana for Forbes on it. The sidebar of a story I was writing on the Silk Road, where I was interviewing the Dread Pirate Roberts, the administrator of that dark-web drug market, and I was foolish enough to send, in some cases, bitcoins directly from my Coinbase wallet to the Silk Road. But then in other cases, I think I did send it through intermediary addresses in an attempt to cover my tracks. When I showed all this to Sarah Meiklejohn, she very easily could trace all of my transactions. She had done undercover transactions with the Silk Road. She had identified that cluster, so she could easily see exactly which drug deals I had done. I think that this kind of captures the problem, which is that cryptocurrency users are not that dumb about this. We all thought back then that if you were just a little bit clever, of course, some mistakes would reveal your cryptocurrency transactions in the blockchain, but if you were really clever, if you just stayed a step ahead of the tracers, if you took some obfuscating steps, then you could actually still be more private with cryptocurrency than with traditional money on the internet. But I think Sarah Meiklejohn and then Chainalysis, which is now this $8.6 billion company that has hired every brilliant person they can think of to find these patterns in the blockchain, what they have shown is that it's a better rule of thumb just to say it's impossible. You will not be able to win this cat-and-mouse game, at least with bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are like it. There are now cryptocurrencies that are designed to be far less traceable than bitcoin or ether or those kinds of well-known original cryptocurrencies. But the problem also with this cat-and-mouse game is that you can use state-of-the-art, cutting-edge obfuscation and anonymity techniques, but somebody years later can figure out a new trick to defeat those techniques. Because it's all recorded in the blockchain forever, they can basically go back in time and excavate that evidence and use it against you, sometimes to prove that you committed a crime. So it's like a cat-and-mouse game where the cats can travel back in time to solve the crimes, and the mice have to think years and years ahead into the future, which is basically impossible. So I think it's almost better just to think of most cryptocurrencies as just completely transparent, which is truly the opposite of what they were promised to be in many cases. I think it's also fair to describe it as having served as a kind of trap for people seeking financial privacy and lots of criminals who were seduced by this false idea and then found that law enforcement was able to just turn the lights on and carry out these huge busts where many hundreds of people were arrested.Michael Calore: Wow. Well, let's take a quick break and we'll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: The crypto market has been pretty wild lately. There's all the recent drama with Sam Bankman-Fried and the collapse of the FTX Exchange. There's the cratered market around NFTs, the rapid devaluation and erratic behavior of many of the currencies. Andy, have these recent instabilities in the cryptocurrency market at all slowed down the use of it on the dark web or in other illicit markets?\nAndy Greenberg: I don't think that they have, for the most part. The one big crime that has kind of slowed down because of the fall in the value of cryptocurrency is scamming, because scammers depend on people believing that their cryptocurrency is going to keep going up in value. But on the dark web, cryptocurrency is really just a means of transaction, and it doesn't really matter so much what it's worth. In fact, the fact that bitcoin appreciated massively from the time when I was buying marijuana on the Silk Road in 2013 really now just means that I spent tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins on a few grams of pot, which is unfortunate when you think about it. But the dark web is not the only place where these crimes that are now traced by the tracers who are the central detectives in my book are taking place. There are also just straight-up thefts that are a huge part of the dark side of the crypto world. When FTX collapsed, in the midst of that collapse, which was like a traditional finance story in a way\u2014an over-leveraged bank or something, or a Lehman Brothers or maybe like a Theranos story. But there's also a straight-up crime story here, where about half a billion dollars of FTX's funds were actually just stolen in the midst of its bankruptcy, and we don't know by whom still. The bizarre thing about the blockchain is that all of these tracers can watch this theft happen in real time. We can see these hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency taken out of FTX and then moved around. They seem to be packaged to try to launder them. But because it's all so transparent and traceable, it's going to be very difficult for whoever took that money to cash it out or spend it or get away with this crime in a way where they won't be identified. So we'll probably soon know if the person who did that was some sort of inside embezzler or external hackers who were trying to take advantage of the chaos of FTX's meltdown.\nLauren Goode: Do you see a mainstream future for some of the more privacy-focused coins, like monero\u2014am I saying that correctly, monero?\u2014or will they be kept at arm's length by legitimate financial institutions?\nAndy Greenberg: It's really interesting to watch. I mean, monero is one that is being adopted. Monero, for the people who maybe haven't heard of it, it's not the most popular cryptocurrency by any means, but it is designed to be much less traceable than bitcoin and to tangle up its blockchain and obfuscate the amounts and make it hard to see who is sending money to whom. And monero is being adopted by dark web markets. One of the big stories in this book is the hunt for and the takedown of the kingpin of AlphaBay, which was this dark web market that became 10 times the size of the Silk Road. Now, years after AlphaBay was taken down, it actually reappeared in 2021, and now only accepts monero, which is a sign of the cat-and-mouse game, as Mike put it, that is occurring and the ways that people are starting to wise up to the traceability of bitcoin at least. But we see that cat-and-mouse game continuing because it does actually seem like sometimes monero, much to the surprise of all of these people using it, can sometimes be traced. monero people hate it when I point this out. In this big case that happened about a year ago where these two New Yorkers were arrested and accused of money laundering \u2026 You probably heard of this case because the woman in this couple had posted these terrible, super cringey rap videos on YouTube. $3.6 billion was seized from this couple, the biggest seizure of money of any kind in US criminal history. They had actually transferred some of that money into monero. Yet, you can see in court documents that the IRS criminal investigators, who were the central detectives in that case, continued to follow it and to identify them as the ones holding it. There's actually even leaked Chainalysis documents that appeared on the dark web that show that Chainalysis says to its law enforcement customers that it can trace monero in the majority of cases. So even when people, even now, believe that they're using a privacy coin, something that's less traceable, they're often still going to be surprised, I think, by how clever the tracers have become, how hard it is to use cryptocurrency anonymously. But I feel like I have to also mention that there is a newer cryptocurrency, zcash, that does seem to be truly untraceable, that uses these new, almost magical-seeming cryptography tricks called zero-knowledge proofs to basically fully encrypt its blockchain, so that there is no information for blockchain analysis or tracing of any kind. That may be finally the untraceable cryptocurrency that people believed bitcoin was. Yeah, as you say, Lauren, it's going to be really interesting to see if zcash is more adopted, and if it is, if it becomes this popular tool for crime or what people once called crypto-anarchy, carving out a space where you can't collect taxes, you can do any black market transaction you want, will that lead to some sort of regulatory backlash where regulators try to ban zcash or prevent exchanges from letting you buy and sell it?Lauren Goode: Well, I'm definitely not an expert in regulation, but I do think a lot about permanence on the internet, what is permanent and what is not, and how we've sometimes deluded ourselves into thinking that some of the things we do, the actions we take, like using cryptocurrency to make a purchase on the dark web or even just moving something into the trash on our desktops, that that somehow is untraceable, that something is vanishing when actually we are laying down these infinitesimal bits, these 1s and 0s that are now the mesh network of our lives. And it's really pretty permanent.\nAndy Greenberg: In some ways, cryptocurrency is a little parable about how people think about committing crimes on the internet, or just their privacy, that we are all leaving this digital exhaust trail. In some cases, you can see these in the stories of the book as well. In one case, the administrator of AlphaBay was first identified because he leaked his email address in a welcome email to the AlphaBay user forums. Although he fixed that problem within days, years later, an anonymous tipster gave that email address to the DEA, and that's how they first learned his name. They later proved his identity and dispelled any doubts and were able to charge him because they traced his cryptocurrency. Yeah, we leave these breadcrumbs behind that we're not aware of. I just think that it turns out the cryptocurrency is maybe the most ironic, the clearest, craziest example of that, because people really thought that they were invisible. In fact, they were leaving totally clear, indelible trails that show every transaction that you make for all time. There are cases where, for instance, IRS criminal investigations identified the alleged creator of a bitcoin money laundering service called Bitcoin Fog by tracing his transactions before he even successfully launched the site, 10 years earlier. So it is just a true, as Edward Snowden would say, a permanent record that, for good or ill, can be used to solve crimes, but also to expose human behavior in a way that we're really just not ready for.\nMichael Calore: Well, thanks Andy for coming on the show and talking about this. Let's take a break, and when we come back we'll do our recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore:  This is the last segment of our show where each of us recommends something our listeners might like. Andy, you get to go first.\nAndy Greenberg: Oh, wow. Well, I have to say I was going to recommend a book called You Are Not Expected to Understand This, which is a collection of essays about lines of code that my WIRED colleague, Lily Hay Newman, contributed to. But Lily, it turns out, already recommended this book on the show, she tells me, a couple weeks ago. So I have to come up with another one. Although, I have to say, that as a really delightful collection of little parables about the history of computing. I guess instead I will recommend this game that I have been obsessed with for years now called Getting Over It. It seems completely ridiculous, but I found it to be kind of profound. You basically are this naked man in a pot with a hammer, and you have to use this hammer to climb a mountain of junk, basically. It's very hard. You constantly can fall and basically lose all the progress that you have made. You can't die in any way. There's no lives. You just sometimes fall and lose the weeks and weeks of climbing that you have put into the game. It's like this little experiment in extreme frustration. The creator of the game, Bennett Foddy, talks to you actually throughout the game, telling you his theories about the nature of failure and frustration and playing bits of songs and poetry that are all around the theme of just the difficulties of life. I find it almost inspiring in a way. I have actually now played through it hundreds of times. I think I'm in the top 5 percent of players in terms of how many times I've played through it, worldwide. Now my 6-year-old son has gotten curious about it, and I just sit and watch him play it. I find that, for a 6-year-old, it's an interesting practice and how frustrated can he become and can he tolerate, which is an important thing for a kid to figure out. Yeah, Getting Over It, I recommended it to everyone.Michael Calore: Nice. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is another work of Andy's actually. We're just recommending each other's work on this podcast. We really do like each other this much here at WIRED.\nAndy Greenberg: It's so incestuous, but I appreciate it. Thank you.\nLauren Goode: I know I sometimes make fun of Mike for talking about being vegan, not being vegan itself, just that you talk about it. But Andy's latest story is going to make you want to avoid eating American-raised pork, because it has made me vow not to eat anymore pork. It's a story about how an animal rights activist group, which Andy has written about before, and WIRED revealed using spy cameras what really happens inside of carbon-dioxide stunning chambers, which are used to slaughter pigs. It's pretty horrific. Food companies have claimed that these CO2 chambers lead to what they would say is painless loss of consciousness and death for the animals. But these videos and Andy's story reveal that, for these pigs, the deaths are anything but painless. It's a pretty hard read, and the videos are even harder to watch. But if you can stomach it, I recommend reading that story. Mike, what's your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: My recomm\u2014\nLauren Goode: Perhaps recommend some vegan food for us.\nMichael Calore: My recommendation is stop eating bacon.\nLauren Goode: There you go. You said it so much more simply than I did.\nMichael Calore: I'm going to recommend a book. It's called Art Is Life. It's by Jerry Saltz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic of New York Magazine and just all around fantastic writer. It is a collection of the last 25 years or so of his essays and criticism and profiles and writing about the art world, particularly artists who are challenging some long-held beliefs in the art world, and artists who are trying new things and stretching the boundaries, and artists who he feels are overrated or overexposed and his thoughts about them. If you have any interest in contemporary art, then you know Jerry Saltz, and you know that you should read this book, so I'm just giving you a nudge. You should definitely check it out. It's brand-new. I'm consuming the audio book, so it is kind of fun to hear his voice read back to me the words that I've read before, not knowing what his voice sounds like. Also, I own the book in physical form, and it's just as enjoyable in either medium. So that's my recommendation, Art Is Life, by Jerry Saltz.\nLauren Goode: The other day, you and I were having a Slack conversation about something completely unrelated. I was like, \u201COh, something, something,\u201D about the BART from Berkeley, and you just replied with a photo of Jerry Saltz, and you wrote, \"Jerry Saltz, exclamation point. I'm currently reading\/listening to his book.\"\nMichael Calore: Well, because he was on Kara's podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, that's great.\nMichael Calore: He was on Kara Swisher's podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, but you heard about Jerry Saltz here first.\nMichael Calore: Yes, yes, indeed. Well, that is our show. Andy, thanks again for joining us.\nAndy Greenberg: Thanks to you both. It's always fun.\nLauren Goode: Always fun having you on, Andy.\nMichael Calore: Once again, the book is called Tracers in the Dark. It's out now. You can buy it anywhere, and you could read some long excerpts of the book on WIRED.com, including the stories about the operations to take down AlphaBay and Welcome to Video. Just check the show notes. We'll link to those there. Thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter and Mastodon. Again, just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth. We will be back next week, provided all these new chatbot search engines don't take our jobs.

No one can spend coins twice because once a transaction is recorded in the ledger, every node in the network will know about it.\nWho paved the way for blockchains?\nDigiCash (1989)\nDigiCash was founded by David Chaum to create a digital-currency system that enabled users to make untraceable, anonymous transactions. It was perhaps too early for its time. It went bankrupt in 1998, just as ecommerce was finally taking off.\nE-Gold (1996)\nE-gold was a digital currency backed by real gold. The company was plagued by legal troubles, and its founder Douglas Jackson eventually pled guilty to operating an illegal money-transfer service and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\nB-Money and Bit-Gold (1998)\nCryptographers Wei Dai (B-money) and Nick Szabo (Bit-gold) each proposed separate but similar decentralized currency systems with a limited supply of digital money issued to people who devoted computing resources.\nRipple Pay (2004)\nNow a cryptocurrency, Ripple started out as a system for exchanging digital IOUs between trusted parties.\nReusable Proofs of Work (RPOW) (2004)\nRPOW was a prototype of a system for issuing tokens that could be traded with others in exchange for computing intensive work. It was inspired in part by Bit-gold and created by bitcoin's second user, Hal Finney.\nThe upshot: No Bitcoin user has to trust anyone else because no one can cheat the system.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nExpert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty - Blockchain\nOther digital currencies have imitated this basic idea, often trying to solve perceived problems with Bitcoin by building cryptocurrencies on new blockchains. But some think the real innovation isn\u2019t digital currency but the decentralized, cryptographically secure ledger, believing the blockchain could usher in a new era of online services that would be impossible to censor; transparently track the provenance of fish, minerals, and Rolex watches; and securely digitize voting, contracts and, with the advent of the metaverse, everything else. \nImmutable ledgers have benefits in business too. Major banks are testing private blockchains to boost trading efficiency while maintaining trust, corporations are tracking internal compliance, and retailers are cleaning up supply chains. But with a few notable exceptions, these use cases remain limited trials or experiments rather than real shifts to using blockchain for business. \nAnd no wonder. Everything that touches the world of cryptocurrency has a sheen of chaos. The value of bitcoin leapt from $5,600 in 2020 to $48,000 in 2021 before crashing down to $13,600 in 2022; whether it\u2019s soaring or spiraling changes month to month, though its value is unquestionably higher than many expected just a few years ago. \nSome cryptocurrencies turned out to be little more than pyramid schemes, while hackers have successfully stolen millions from crypto traders. Even stablecoins pegged to the dollar have stumbled, as have those backed by industry giants\u2014Facebook\u2019s Libra was shut down in 2022 after flailing for years. Meanwhile, ideas like ICOs and NFTs make millions for some and crash amid accusations of fraud before fading from the limelight. \nAnd then scandals like FTX hit. The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed in November 2022, with billions of customer funds missing, and sparked a criminal fraud investigation that has led to the arrest of cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried. \nEven before the FTX scandal, the crypto industry was hit by a crisis of confidence, with crashing values sparking layoffs at industry leaders like Coinbase. Some may argue that this is the death throes of an idea that never really found its feet, but it may just be growing pains before cryptocurrencies and the distributed ledger that powers them settle down and find some real purpose. \nIt\u2019s too early to say which experiments, if any, will stick: decentralized money or corporate compliance? Automated secure contracts or supply-chain tracking? Digital voting or virtual art in the metaverse? Private corporate ledgers or public decentralized blockchains? But the idea of creating tamper-proof databases has captured the attention of everyone from anarchist techies to staid bankers.\nThe First Blockchain\nThe original Bitcoin software was released to the public in January 2009. It was open source, meaning anyone could examine the code and reuse it. \nWhat's an \"ICO\"?\nEthereum and other blockchain-based projects have raised funds through a controversial practice called an \"initial coin offering,\" or ICO: The creators of new digital currencies sell a certain amount of the currency, usually before they\u2019ve finished the software and technology that underpins it. The idea is that investors can get in early while giving developers the funds to finish the tech. The catch is that these offerings have traditionally operated outside the regulatory framework meant to protect investors. Since the first tidal wave of ICOs in 2017, the SEC has said that virtually all violated securities law. Newer companies are increasingly looking for regulatory loopholes: a more common practice these days to raise money the traditional way (through VCs) and \u201Cairdrop\u201D coins to users for free.\nAnd many have. At first, blockchain enthusiasts sought to simply improve on Bitcoin. Litecoin, another virtual currency based on the Bitcoin software, seeks to offer faster transactions. One of the first projects to repurpose the blockchain for more than currency was Namecoin, a system for registering \u201C.bit\u201D domain names that dodges government censorship. \nNamecoin tries to solve this problem by storing .bit domain registrations in a blockchain, which theoretically makes it impossible for anyone without the encryption key to change the registration information. To seize a .bit domain name, a government would have to find the person responsible for the site and force them to hand over the key. Other coins, also known as altcoins, were less serious in nature\u2014notably the popular meme-based DogeCoin.\nIn 2013, a startup called Ethereum published a paper outlining an idea that promised to make it easier for coders to create their own blockchain-based software without having to start from scratch or rely on the original Bitcoin software. \nThat sparked a shift away from currency-only applications. Two years later, Ethereum unveiled its platform for \u201Csmart contracts,\u201D software applications that can enforce an agreement without human intervention. For example, you could create a smart contract to bet on tomorrow\u2019s weather. You and your gambling partner would upload the contract to the Ethereum network and then send a little digital currency, which the software would essentially hold in escrow. The next day, the software would check the weather and send the winner their earnings. A number of \u201Cprediction markets\u201D have been built on the platform, enabling people to bet on more interesting outcomes, such as which political party will win an election.\nAs long as the software is written correctly, there\u2019s no need to trust anyone in these transactions. But that turns out to be a big if. In 2016, a hacker made off with about $50 million worth of Ethereum\u2019s custom currency intended for a democratized investment system in which investors would pool their money and vote on how to invest it. A coding error allowed a still unknown person to make off with the virtual cash. Lesson: It\u2019s hard to remove humans from transactions, with or without a blockchain.\nICO Boom and Crash\nAnd then came the ICO gold rush. Ethereum and other blockchain-based projects raised funds through a controversial practice called an \u201Cinitial coin offering.\u201D In an ICO, creators of new digital currencies sell a certain amount of the currency, usually before they\u2019ve finished the software and technology that underpins it. \nThe idea is that investors can get in early while giving developers the funds to finish the tech. The catch is that these offerings have traditionally operated outside the regulatory framework meant to protect investors. Since the first tidal wave of ICOs in 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has said that virtually all of them violated securities law, while research revealed that nearly half of ICOs from that era failed\u2014no surprise, given so many were outright scams, with developers faking projects and disappearing with funds. The ICO market subsequently crashed, halving in value from its peak to the next year, though they continue to be a fundraising vehicle in the world of crypto. \nBusiness Blockchain\nThere\u2019s more to the blockchain than cryptocurrency. Startups are leveraging the ledger technology to track the provenance of everything from fish to diamonds and even watches and whiskey. Everledger tracks luxury goods, such as art and diamonds, and has worked with the Australian government on a pilot to regulate critical minerals. Provenance uses the blockchain to track fish from catch to sale; if a fisherman, distributor, or retailer attempts to alter the origin of a single filet, their actions will be obvious, as each party holds its own versions of the data. \nBecause of that ability to reveal fraud, blockchain has been touted as a way to secure voting; manage property sales and other contracts; and track identity, qualifications, or even concert tickets. But none of that has yet to go truly mainstream. Walmart Canada turned to blockchain to address payment disputes with freight carriers by automatically sending payments rather than manually reconciling invoices, and the company has since expanded its use of blockchain. \nBut it\u2019s still early days for blockchain, with such business applications often described as a solution without a problem. One challenge is that some businesses aren\u2019t excited about the decentralized architecture that\u2019s at the heart of blockchain, instead choosing to act as a central trusted party and control the ledger themselves. When such a \u201Cprivate blockchain\u201D is preferred, a database could perhaps do the trick without the added complexity.\nBeyond Finance\nMore recently, the idea of tokens has taken off. These are assets that can be traded on a blockchain, most famously as NFTs (nonfungible tokens). Like cryptocurrency, they\u2019re managed, tracked, and traded via blockchains. Unlike Bitcoin and its ilk, they\u2019re unique digital content\u2014anything from a tweet to a song to art or, again, a bottle of whiskey\u2014that can be bought and owned like a painting hung on a wall.\nThe idea is to confer ownership of a digital item or track ownership of a physical object. Anyone can screenshot and download a digital picture, but whoever holds the NFT actually owns it. That means artists have a new way of selling their work, whether an established artist like Damien Hirst or a digital creator like Beeple, who sold an NFT of his work for $69 million at Christie\u2019s auction house. \nThe heat around NFTs has cooled\u2014Jack Dorsey\u2019s first tweet sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but was removed from auction after stalling at $14,000 a year later\u2014but they could find their footing in the metaverse, with Nike buying NFT studio RTFKT and selling virtual shoes on the Polygon blockchain. \nSustainable Stake\nBut when NFTs, ICOs, and digital currencies are successful, the planet suffers. Bitcoin is \u201Cmined\u201D by tasking computers with solving equations for no reason other than to show they\u2019ve done the work. In the early days, bitcoin mining could be done efficiently enough with a robust desktop, but the difficulty of proof-of-work equations increases with every bitcoin that\u2019s mined, so the home mining setup long ago gave way to professional, bespoke systems running thousands of high-end graphics cards, often in highly customized data centers built for the task. \nAll of that eats through incredible amounts of energy and results in equally significant carbon emissions. Bitcoin consumes more electricity annually than the entire nation of Belgium, according to one piece of research from the University of Cambridge. And that\u2019s just bitcoin, with Ethereum chewing through about a third as much. NFTs, for example, require at least 35 kWh of electricity each, emitting as much as 20 kg of CO2 apiece. There is a solution: switching from proof of work to proof of stake. Rather than crunching arbitrary algorithms to earn a reward, you \u201Cstake\u201D a chunk of cryptocurrency in the network. That buys you a chance of being selected to earn cryptocurrency by validating a block, sort of like a lottery. Try to meddle with the system by changing a block and the network will take some or all of your stake. \nEthereum shifted its original network, Mainnet, to proof of stake in September 2022. Etherum says the change, dramatically dubbed \u201Cthe merge,\u201D slashes energy consumption by 99.95 percent. It should also make it harder to hack blockchain networks by dominating a chain, known as a 51 percent attack\u2014with proof of stake running Ethereum\u2019s Mainnet, that would cost billions of dollars. \nSuch benefits may not be enough to convince other blockchains, including Bitcoin, to move to proof of stake, not least because so many miners have invested heavily in computing infrastructure. So blockchains\u2014and the cryptocurrencies and other digital innovations that live on them\u2014will continue to churn through electricity and exacerbate the climate crisis. \nThe Future of Blockchain\nDespite the blockchain hype\u2014and many experiments\u2014there\u2019s still no \u201Ckiller app\u201D for the technology beyond speculation and (maybe) payments. Blockchain proponents admit that it could take a while for the technology to catch on. After all, the internet\u2019s foundational technologies were created in the 1960s, but it took decades for the internet to become ubiquitous. \nICOs were scammy. NFTs are bewildering. Bitcoin remains too unstable for payments. And FTX shows that chaos still lurks at the heart of cryptocurrency. But there\u2019s no question venture capital investment, art sales, and global finance were, and still are, in need of democratization and decentralization. Blockchain proves there could be another way. And it is maturing, as shown by Ethereum\u2019s move to more sustainable operations. Blockchain doesn\u2019t need a killer app: It needs thousands of small useful ones. ICOs could reemerge as a decentralized funding mechanism for local projects. NFTs could evolve into virtual products for the metaverse. And if the crypto Wild West settles down, it could upend who controls the world\u2019s money. Give it time\u2014blockchain might do better out of the spotlight. \nLearn More\nThe Future of Digital Cash Is not on the Blockchain\nIf you want the privacy of paper money, you need something that leaves no paper trail.\nPublic Blockchains Are the New National Economies of the Metaverse\nThe \u201Cfiscal\u201D and \u201Cmonetary\u201D policy tools of smart contract blockchain platforms may work even better than the economic policy tools of governments.\nBlockchains Have a \u2018Bridge\u2019 Problem, and Hackers Know It\nBlockchain bridges are a crucial piece of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which makes them prime targets for attacks.\nWhat's Blockchain Actually Good for, Anyway?

Instead, 2023 will be the year when we\u2019ll become \u201Cmetaverse-ready.\u201D  \nREAD MORE\nThis story is from the WIRED World in 2023, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here\u2014or download or order a copy of the magazine.\nThere are already amazing immersive and interactive experiences available, including games like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox. But none of these games truly pay off on the promise of the metaverse we imagine today, a virtual world in which we can meet friends and strangers from around the world to play, explore, shop, and interact. To bring that vision to reality, we have some work to do in areas like content production, technology standards, and virtual commerce.\nOne thing we know about the metaverse is that it will succeed only if it is filled with rich, interactive, personalized, and engaging 3D content. Many companies and creators have already begun ramping up 3D content creation, not only because it allows them to experiment with metaverse experiences for the future, but because it helps them solve business problems now. Creating in 3D lets companies create marketing images for websites, catalogs, and ads in a way that\u2019s faster, cheaper, more scalable, and more sustainable. For instance, three-quarters of product images in IKEA catalogs are already rendered in 3D, rather than shot. Ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s produces thousands of product images in weeks, rather than months, by rendering them in 3D\u2014and at a fraction of the cost.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nMany companies are also now using 3D creation to design new products. Tommy Hilfiger used 3D assets to shave two weeks off its design review process. Designers at footwear brand Salomon also found that rendering new shoe designs virtually cuts the time to produce a prototype by up to 67 percent.\nIn 2023, having all that 3D content on hand gives companies the freedom to experiment with new metaverse concepts. They can pilot new approaches, partner with other companies, and see what works and what doesn\u2019t. A great example is Amazon, which is experimenting with an augmented reality system that allows shoppers to place AR versions of products in their own homes. No one knows exactly what the metaverse will look like\u2014it\u2019ll come together through trial-and-error\u2014but companies with libraries of 3D content to experiment with will be the architects of this new medium.\nThe other essential factor for the metaverse to succeed will be its technological standards. HTML, for instance, helped the internet flourish by ensuring that web pages looked and behaved the same way in all browsers. Similarly, companies and individuals won\u2019t spend time and money creating content for the metaverse if they can\u2019t publish that content anywhere and have it look\u2014and behave\u2014as they intend it to. There\u2019s still lots of work to do here, but groups like Khronos Group, the Realtime Conference, and Metaverse Standards Forum are bringing together tech companies, hardware makers, and retailers to work on open standards that will begin to govern metaverse content. Among the standards under development is USD, known as the HTML of the metaverse, which will allow 3D assets to be shared and rendered across many different immersive experiences. Another standard, glTF, the JPEG of 3D, will allow 3D assets to be compressed so that they\u2019re small enough to be transmitted efficiently.\nJust as hundreds of billions of dollars of purchases now happen on the internet, the metaverse will also become an important avenue for commerce. But the metaverse won\u2019t just be a place to buy a shirt, coffee maker, or other physical goods. As people develop their personal avatars in the metaverse, they\u2019ll want to equip their alter egos with virtual shoes, cars, and art. In 2023, we\u2019ll start to establish how to buy and sell physical and virtual goods in the metaverse. We\u2019re starting to see this already with NFTs. A key to their value is their portability\u2014they can be stored, accessed, and transferred easily through the blockchain.\nOverall, the most important aspect of building a successful metaverse will be recreating human experiences at scale. In many ways, we all yearn for a small-town life\u2014we crave digital experiences that feel more intimate, we want to do business with people who know us, and we want to build our community. The promise of the metaverse is to enable those kinds of essential human experiences in a world that is free from the laws of time, space, and physics. If we can get that right, there\u2019s no question the metaverse will succeed.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63a267bff91d8eb80fcab0f3\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/03_It_s-time-to-get-metaverse-ready.jpg","author":"BY SCOTT BELSKY","title":"It\u2019s Not Too Early To Become Metaverse-Ready","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/metaverse-business-commerce\/","tags":["","VIRTUAL REALITY","VR","ECOMMERCE","AUGMENTED REALITY","3-D","THE WIRED WORLD IN 2023"]},{"date":"01.03.2023","summary":"Technology's biggest trade show must go on, in spite of rough economic headwinds.

Many companies opted to continue virtually attending the annual consumer trade show. Even though CES 2023 is not expected to recapture the entire grandeur of years past, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) that hosts the event anticipates around 100,000 attendees.\nCES 2023 runs from January 5 to 8, and it still offers an option for remote attendance. In spite of an economy that\u2019s worrisome for most CEOs and last year\u2019s major flops (remember NFTs?), innovative hardware announcements will continue to make a splash on the showroom floor. From cohesive developments in the smart home category to peculiar designs for electric vehicles, here\u2019s what you can expect at CES 2023.\nMore CES Coverage\nCES Liveblog\n9 Neat Things We've Seen So Far\n9 More Cool Things from CES 2023\nGadget Lab Podcast: CES 2023\nWIRED's Best of CES 2023\nInteroperability That Matters\nWhat if every aspect of your smart home actually worked together, even if the products were made by different companies? Matter, a new protocol from the Connectivity Standards Alliance, enables seamless interoperability between smart home devices from Apple, Amazon, Google, Samsung, and other manufacturers. Previous fragmentation held back the overall smart home experience, especially for consumers who wanted to mix and match gadgets. \u201CThe great promise of the smart home, literally since its inception, is that all the connected gadgets would work seamlessly together,\u201D WIRED senior editor Michael Calore tells me. \u201CThat hasn\u2019t been the case at all, so Matter feels like the next big step toward that promised interoperability.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nChess Pro Answers Questions From Twitter\nLaunched last year in November, almost 300 products are already Matter-certified, with more announcements expected at CES 2023. \u201CMatter makes smart home devices easier to buy for consumers as they can now choose the products that best fit their needs, regardless of what ecosystem, smartphone, app, or voice assistant they have,\u201D writes Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, over email. Lights, locks, and thermostats are a few of the categories currently supported. The company is working to extend compatibility for additional smart home devices like cameras, appliances, and smoke detectors.\nIts unique approach to smart home security uses blockchain technology. Richardson writes, \u201CMatter also raises the bar for security, using blockchain to validate and store credentials on the home network, encrypting messages (commands) between devices, enabling local control (no cloud), and including a pathway to easy security updates.\u201D Safety experts point out cloud control as a major weakness when it comes to securing the data collected by your smart home.\nThe Metaverse Sobers Up\nAt last year\u2019s CES, plans for a utopian metaverse where consumers would live, work, and play like never before were a primary focus. While not completely scrapped, the unquestioned excitement for the concept has dissipated due to billions of dollars lost, slow consumer adoption, and turbulent macroeconomic factors.\nAlthough the tenor of discussions is subdued, you can expect hardware innovations to continue for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu anticipates a potential breakthrough moment for smart glasses as they become less cumbersome: \u201CThat's been one of the biggest barriers to the category, and I think we can expect some companies to showcase some strides in making components smaller and lighter, so that AR glasses don\u2019t have to be thick, ugly, and heavy.\u201D\nMighty Morphin\u2019 Electric Vehicles \nDuring CES 2023, you can bank on seeing plenty of electric vehicles that don\u2019t match the aesthetics of a typical car. \u201CSince EVs don\u2019t have gas tanks or traditional drivetrains, and since their battery packs can be shaped flat, the interior flooring doesn\u2019t have all the bumps or humps that we\u2019ve been dealing with for decades,\u201D writes Calore. \u201CThat frees up the designers to think about the interior in new ways, from seating configurations to entertainment systems.\u201D Although the more outlandish ideas will not be available anytime soon at your local dealer, the concept cars provide a small peek into what might be on the road five or 10 years in the future.\nA Saturation of Sustainability\nWhether it\u2019s smartphone cases created from recycled materials or TV remotes that don\u2019t need batteries, companies will continue to rethink their manufacturing process to placate a growing consumer demand for sustainable goods. \u201CI\u2019m seeing more and more companies highlight how a product is made and whether it uses recycled or sustainable materials, which seems to be the trajectory where everyone is heading,\u201D writes Chokkattu.\nSustainability trends may even impact your at-home spa nights! Decadent bubble baths are out. Decadent (albeit short) showers are in. \u201CMy one weird observation is that when the pandemic started, everyone was really talking about baths, like Kohler\u2019s ultra-luxurious Stillness Bath. Now, people are more concerned about sustainability and water usage, which means that I\u2019m seeing a lot of ultra-luxurious, uh, showers,\u201D shares WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So. \u201CI\u2019m going to go ahead and say that luxury showering is going to be a trend in 2023. Installing a low-flow showerhead that heats the air around it is good. Just don\u2019t stay in the shower for 40 minutes.\u201D\nGadgetry Galore\nOf course, CES this year will include a flurry of new product announcements, from a wireless TV that uses vacuum suction to stick on the wall to gaming laptops that are just a wee bit bigger. Chokkattu anticipates further developments for smartphone cameras, with improved data collection for applications like skin condition detection. \nSo still expects companies to launch health tracking devices specifically made for \u201Cfertile, pregnant, or immediately postpartum people,\u201D despite the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She also foresees an impending proliferation of satellite messengers that are affordable and easy to use for anyone who wants to stay safe when they\u2019re off the grid.\nMichael Calore, Julian Chokkattu, and Adrienne So contributed to this report.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63a4b6a89b14ca84bad145bf\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/What-to-Expect-CES-Gear-GettyImages-1237527679.jpg","author":"BY REECE ROGERS","title":"Here\u2019s What You Can Expect at CES 2023","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ces-2023-what-to-expect\/","tags":["","CES","CONSUMER TECH","SMART HOME","METAVERSE","ELECTRIC VEHICLES","SUSTAINABILITY"]},{"date":"12.29.2022","summary":"This week, we look back at 2022\u2019s biggest consumer tech stories.

It's like a proper noun.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: It's like an improper noun.\nMichael Calore: I mean, he looms large. What about you?\nLauren Goode: I went with a dictionary word, so I chose inauspicious.\nMichael Calore: Inauspicious.\nLauren Goode: Inauspicious.\nMichael Calore: That's dark.\nLauren Goode: Look it up. It is dark. It is, but it's been a weird year.\nMichael Calore: It has been a very strange year. I mean, all years are strange, but I think this year is off the charts.\nLauren Goode: We should talk about it.\nMichael Calore: Let's do it.\n[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]\nLauren Goode: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: I'm Michael Calore. I'm a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: This is our last Gadget Lab episode of the year. Now in the past, we would usually publish a rerun episode around this time of year, but we heard that you all actually really like listening to Gadget Lab in December, maybe because you're looking for a little escape from the family or you're traveling and you need some pods for the long ride. So we are here taping this in mid-December and hoping you will find a little joy in this episode. So Mike and I have been doing a lot of reflecting and some debating over the biggest tech news of 2022. As journalists, we're often covering the news, but a big part of the job is also being an avid news consumer, and we've both been totally steeped in all things metaverse, Web3, Zuck, Apple, Twitter, SBF.\nMichael Calore: Elon.\nLauren Goode: Elon Musk. Mike, I'm just going to get straight to it. What do you think was the biggest tech news story of 2022?\nMichael Calore: Well, when we prepared for this episode, we compiled our own lists of the things that we wanted to talk about, and then we shared our lists with each other. I have something that I want to talk about, but I think the thing that you want to talk about is more important. So we should talk about that first, and that's Tweelon.\nLauren Goode: Tweelon.\nMichael Calore: Mr. Tweelon.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I mean, you pretty much hinted this in the intro to our show that this was going to be a big topic for us today. So this one first started back in April when Elon Musk said he would take on a 9.2 percent stake of Twitter and exercise his influence over the company through its board. Then he quickly said he wouldn't be joining the board, and then a few days later announced his intention to just buy Twitter, just buy it for somewhere around $44 billion. Now, a whole bunch of stuff happened in the following months, where Musk then accused Twitter of having a bigger bot problem than initially disclosed. Twitter investors sued Musk on and on and on. Musk seemed to be trying to find a way out of the deal while the rest of us were trying to figure out what an Elon-owned Twitterverse would look like. Then at the end of October, it actually happened. The deal closed and Tweelon, as we've been calling it here at WIRED, was a real thing, but of course, it's not like the chaos went away\u2014quite the opposite. Musk fired half of Twitter staff. He announced and then held back on plans for a new verification scheme and an increased subscription fee for Twitter Blue. He reinstated some prominent accounts on the platform. He blocked some others. He released a batch of files about content moderation that seemed to amount to a lot of performative transparency. Most recently, he stoked conservative trolls by tweeting something derogatory about people's preferred pronouns. Yeah, and this is, by the way, just in mid-December as I mentioned.Michael Calore: That's the most terrifying thing about this story is the fact that in the six or seven or eight days between now and the time that this episode airs, absolutely anything could happen.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, which is always the case in the news, but it feels amplified this time around.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Everything's happening very, very quickly at Twitter.\nLauren Goode: It's incredibly chaotic. I mean, on the one hand, people of certain age, like you and I.\nMichael Calore: Or of certain professions.\nLauren Goode: Or of certain professions. We've seen social networks come and go before, and we were just talking about this this week. We were talking about Friendster and MySpace and the early blogging platforms, and maybe this is just the beginning of the end for this one. I mean, we will eventually all find another place together online to share our most mundane or, in some people's cases, insane thoughts. On the other hand, what's happening at Twitter now and what has happened this year is, I think, emblematic of bigger problems around trust and platforms and social discourse and even democracy. I don't think I'm overstating. This entire saga to me signals the end to something that was fundamental to the consumer internet and the earliest days of social media, which was really just about connecting. It feels like that's an afterthought now, and maybe people are still connecting, but the platforms are really about amplifying. They're about amplifying hateful content, outrage, stoking the outrage. They're not exactly the healthiest places to be.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I agree with you. I think that what's happening is really a reckoning with our relationship with social media. I think so many people rely on Twitter for news and for what is happening now in the world. It really feels like it has that pulse that you can't get anywhere else. You can't get that on Facebook. You can't get that on Instagram. It's a real-time service. Us as journalists probably have a much more dependent or codependent relationship on Twitter than other consumers of Twitter would\u2014or even Twitter power users\u2014just because our jobs are very tied into Twitter. All of the people that are in our profession are on Twitter, and I think that's unique compared to every other profession. So for us to sit there and talk about Twitter and how important it is and how much it means, it feels a little bit like navel-gazing, but also, I do think it's important to note that the fact that Twitter is so big is part of the reason why it is so toxic. The fact that absolutely everybody on there can post whatever they want is part of the reason that it feels like that, that it feels so exhausting to be there some days, right? There's still wonderful things that happen on Twitter. There's still great connections that happen, but where that hate and that dog pile effect happens, that's when it starts to feel nasty, and it's because it's so crowded, because it's such a big open platform. So I agree with you. I think that people are starting to recognize that and go to smaller communities. We talk a lot about Mastodon. We've talked about it on this show. I still don't see some giant exodus over to Mastodon, but those are smaller communities, that the whole idea of the fediverse in general is that it's all of these little fiefdoms, subreddits if you will, smaller communities. I think that when people gather around those smaller communities, they start to see that the conversation is better, right? The conversation is richer. There's less hate just because it's a smaller group. Yeah, I've been on a mailing list, many mailing lists where there's a few hundred subscribers, and there's one, just, asshole who ruins it for everybody, and everybody quits and wants to go somewhere else. So that's always going to happen, but I think the smaller group is probably the future of social media, and that the big platform is a problem, and we're recognizing it as a problem, let alone the fact that there's one person calling the shots there now.Lauren Goode: So it sounds like you're in favor of a more decentralized social media existence in 2023.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I think it would be wonderful, right? Wouldn't it be great if you could just go to a place to hang out and it was only the people you wanted to hang out with and not all the people talking about all the stuff that you didn't want to pay attention to right now?\nLauren Goode: We're hearing the word decentralized a lot, and in particular around Mastodon because of the way that Mastodon works as a social network, that it's all of these different servers being run and that there's not just one person who's running the entity. I think what I would be looking for is a little more diversified, if not decentralized. Decentralized might not actually catch on with normcore audiences because of its inability to scale and because some of these alternative services are actually still very clunky to use, let's be honest.\nMichael Calore: Oh, they're all super clunky.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I think what you're describing is if you have a social network for your art space, a social network for your sports space, a social network for your actual close friends and family, a social network that's for work and for more performative posts, things like that, that seems like maybe it's a good thing to try, at least in 2023, because this Twitter story, and we said we were going to get to this\u2014definitely still a part of the conversation in 2023. We're waking up on January 1 and there's going to be something else Elon-related, Tweelon-related.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, for sure.\nLauren Goode: So we should just be ready for that.\nMichael Calore: For sure, especially because we have elections coming up in this country, and everybody's going to be looking at not only Twitter, but all the social networks to see how they're going to protect against misinformation and bad campaigns and outside actors, Russian bots. All of those things are going to continue to be a big issue on social media platforms, and Twitter's not going anywhere. I mean, like we said, absolutely anything can happen, but chances are, Twitter's not going anywhere. It's still going to be around by the time we get to the primary season, right?\nLauren Goode: Oh, yeah. Yes. It's not going anywhere. There was that moment a few weeks ago when we all logged on to Twitter one night and it felt very funeral. Everyone was like, \"If I never told you before I loved you,\" I said it was like the scene of Almost Famous where they thought the plane was going down and they're literally like, \"Oh, I love you,\" and it was like, \"Whoa,\" and then the plane straightens itself out. So yeah, I don't think Twitter is going away necessarily in 2023, but it's probably a good opportunity to explore some other places on the web. OK. I asked this before and now I'm going to come back to it. What do you think was the biggest story of 2022?Michael Calore: I think the biggest story, maybe not the biggest story, but the big one that I want to highlight today is the relationship between art and artificial intelligence.\nLauren Goode: Oh, this is a good one.\nMichael Calore: Right? So this is the year that we saw the release of a lot of tools that have been in the works and we've watched grow up in public, things like Dall-E and Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, tools where you give it a prompt and it gives you a visual interpretation of that prompt, right? AI art, what we've come to know as AI art. They're really interesting to me because they have been dictating this change in our relationship with computers, and they've trained a lot of people to learn a lot about how machine learning works. So these tools are built using datasets that, they basically feed a bunch of data into one of these programs, and it looks at all of it and then says, \"OK. I think I understand how all of these things relate to each other and how language relates to all of those things.\" So you can tell me what you want and I'll be able to give it to you and give it to you in a way that's recognizable to you, right? So it started out being weird. You'd get these really weird pictures when you type in things like \u201Cfrog price\u201D or \u201CNicolas Cage as President of the United States.\u201D It was fun and it was interesting, but as the tools became less discernible as bad AI art and started actually looking like real art that we would expect to see an artist do, a human artist do, then that's when the conversation shifted. It really forced us to choose how we want to define art. Is art something that is created by a human being? Or does an image created by a machine count as art?\nLauren Goode: Right, and if we as human beings have influences in our creative lives, we take information in, we process it, and sometimes that directly appears in some form and anything that we put out, whether we're writers or painters or musicians. How is that different from a computer processing that load?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and I would argue that art is always self-referential. You're talking about subconscious references, right?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, yeah, exactly, not plagiarism or explicit copying, but yeah.\nMichael Calore: If you want to be a singer-songwriter in the English language right now, then chances are Bob Dylan is going to be part of your sound.\nLauren Goode: Sure. Exactly, and you would say that. Someone would say, \"Who has influenced you?\" and you list the names of artists.\nMichael Calore: So that changes when you talk about datasets and you talk about the fact that you're feeding art created by actual humans to this machine, and then you're telling the machine, \"OK. Do something like this.\" There are studies that are coming out now. Researchers have found that in some cases, some of these AI art programs are directly copying pieces of the images that they were trained on. So you show it enough images of a tree, and then you ask it, \"Show me a tree,\" and it will sometimes just go into its memory and grab a tree and show that to you.Lauren Goode: Oh, interesting.\nMichael Calore: So it actually is plagiarizing, even though it doesn't necessarily know the rules around plagiarization. It doesn't know what constitutes plagiarism and what doesn't. So it's still evolving in that sense, but it is forcing that conversation. Artists are really pissed about this. Artists know that their work has been fed into a machine, and now the machine is being asked to produce work that looks like their work that you used to pay them for. Also, I will say that part of the purpose of art is to force these types of conversations, to force people to think critically about the world around them. So I would argue that AI art is art. It's the highest form of art. It's conceptual art. In a sense, you are trying to make people think about, \u201CWhat is art?\u201D That is what great art does. I know this is sounding really heady, but that's true, right? So you have to look at things, tools like this, particularly tools like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, as being part of this great experiment where we're all reckoning with how we relate to machines. So that's the way that I'm choosing to look at it. I know that there are probably people who create visual art for a living who are listening to me talk about this and thinking that I'm full of shit\u2014and that's true, I am full of shit\u2014but I will say that I think that the person who sits down at a computer and types in a prompt with the intention of creating an image from one of these systems that forces you to confront the relationship between human-created art and machine-created art is actually an artist. So the person who types that in with that intention is an artist. The person who types something in without that intention just to get a pretty picture, that person's not an artist.\nLauren Goode: So you see it less as a generative threat and more as a tool, and artists use tools. That's what they do. They just use each new technological development to level up and make the thing that they were maybe going to make some version of anyway.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: That's really interesting.\nMichael Calore: I think that we can have a debate about this, and this is why I think it's important because next year in 2023, we're going to see tools that are even better. We're going to learn a lot more about how the output that we're seeing in public on the internet is being moderated both by machines and by humans. I'm sure that Open AI, one of the most important and well-known companies in this field, has human moderators who are making sure that pornography doesn't go out on the internet, AI-generated pornography doesn't go out on the internet. So we're going to learn a lot more about how humans are drawing boundaries around these things, but also, we're going to see people using them in even more interesting ways. That's when something like this becomes interesting, when somebody sits down and they type out a prompt and then you look at the picture and the picture you see makes you think about, what was that person thinking, why did they type those words, that's really weird that they typed those words and this came out.Lauren Goode: This toothpaste is out of the tube.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, fully.\nLauren Goode: There's no putting these tools back in.\nMichael Calore: Fully.\nLauren Goode: All right. Let's take a quick break, and when we come back, we're going to dig into more of this year's big tech stories and give some of our predictions.\n[Break]\nLauren Goode: All right. We're back. Mike, we already covered Tweelon Musk and the weird world of generative AI art. What's next on the list for you?\nMichael Calore: The crypto crash?\nLauren Goode: Oh, yeah. I knew this was coming.\nMichael Calore: Yup. Everything that happened in cryptocurrency in 2022, I think we can roll together under that banner, the crypto crash, right? We had the NFT market hit a new high and then tumble. We had the price of cryptocurrencies tumble. We had the fraud investigation at the FTX Exchange. We had\u2014\nLauren Goode: Well, prior to that, the stablecoins collapsed too.\nMichael Calore: The stablecoins collapsed. Oh, yeah, right. I forgot about\u2014\nLauren Goode: Yeah, Terra and Luna, don't forget about those.\nMichael Calore: I mean, I think we have to be careful when we laugh about these things because we are talking about a lot of people losing their livelihoods.\nLauren Goode: Very real money.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and a lot of people not only losing magical internet money, but losing their home, right? Their dream just crumbled, but what was their dream built on? It was built on this promise. It was built on this brand new technology. It was built on something that all of the greedy people in the world started exerting force on. So watching it come down and watching it really go through its first big crisis felt like a moment to step back and think about what role cryptocurrency is going to hold in our future, right? We talked on our last show when we had Steven Levy on talking about the Ledger Stax wallet. That wallet can hold cryptocurrency, but it can also hold things like your driver's license and your passport and other important documents. So blockchain technology is still really exciting.\nLauren Goode: Is it?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, yeah, for sure, just because it has that secure aspect to it. So it's a way of guaranteeing trust about certain things in your life, digital assets in your life, everything from government documents to concert tickets. It makes all of those things more secure than they were in the world of paper and smartphones and emails. So cryptocurrency though, and NFTs and coins and banking and all of that, I feel like it just got raided.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, because I felt like most of this year I was really trying to get a better grasp on the crypto market and NFTs and some actual real-life use cases for the blockchain. I just don't feel like I got very far. This funny thing happened where I reached out to a company that makes frames for NFTs and asked them what they're making, and they sent me a couple of loaners. So I had these NFTs sitting on my kitchen counter for a few months, and I remember I was going to write about them, and then other deadlines came up and other projects, and I just kept putting it off and putting it off. By the time I finally wrote about them, I think I received them in January, February, and then by the time I wrote about them in the spring, I think the headline of my article was literally, no one cares about my framed NFTs. People would come over and see them and say, \"What's that weird pulsing jellyfish frame on your counter?\" and I'd say, \"That's an NFT.\" Actually, that wasn't the NFT. There was a Steph Curry NFT on my counter, but anyway.Michael Calore: It would kill the conversation when you told them it was an NFT.\nLauren Goode: Well, one of my friend's sons took out his phone and made a point, took a photo of it and said, \"There, now I have your NFT. What's to stop me from selling this as an NFT?\" But that's a whole other story about how we value the original form of art versus reprints of art, getting back to our first segment conversation, actually. Yeah, the crypto market had a rough year. We have seen dips in the crypto market before. The diehards insist that that's OK, that it's going to bounce back, that it's not going anywhere. They still believe in decentralization. They still, as Steven Levy said on our podcast a couple weeks ago, see trust as a pejorative term because they think that the institutions that we have long relied on are not necessarily the most trustworthy, not how you want to back your money. Isn't it better if you bind this system instead? I think we'll still see some innovation around it, but wow, is it a rough year for crypto, and in particular the people who trusted Sam Bankman-Fried.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Next year, we'll probably continue to see innovation in cryptocurrency companies and in blockchain companies, but I think it will be harder to buy into the hype now that everyone's gone through this rough patch. Let's move on. What is your final big story for 2022?\nLauren Goode: Well, it's not final because there's an endless list. How much time do we have?\nMichael Calore: Exactly.\nLauren Goode: We have to talk about the metaverse.\nMichael Calore: Oh, goodie.\nLauren Goode: Oh, boy, the metaverse, the unfulfilled promises of the metaverse. We can't talk about the metaverse without talking about Meta, which has said it would spend billions of dollars on building out this vision of the metaverse, this 3D virtual reality world that's supposed to represent the next era of computing. Now, the amount that they have said they intend to spend in the actual operating losses differ a little bit. Zuckerberg has said he planned to spend around $10 billion a year on the metaverse, but according to a recent report from The Information, the actual annualized metaverse investment is at nearly $15 billion this year. We, of course, can see the company's operating losses when they report earnings, and we know that for the past three quarters, at least, it has lost more than $3 billion per quarter. So this is an incredibly expensive bet for Meta. It's not just Meta either, right? Some companies don't want to necessarily call it the metaverse or say they're a part of that, but companies like Microsoft and Niantic and Snap are also investing millions or billions in the area of virtual reality and augmented reality. The biggest actual news this year was probably Meta's announcement of the Meta Quest Pro headset, a very expensive futuristic headset that, based on my experience, really offered a futuristic vision of computing. It was pretty cool.Michael Calore: A stereoscopic vision of computing.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it was ... What are they called? Pancake lenses?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, pancake optics. So they've packed this really advanced display technology into what's a smaller frame. You're still wearing the thing on your face. Let's put a pin in that. Then the biggest news next year or maybe the year after would be if Apple announces some headset, maybe something else comes from Google, but I'm going to declare it now. The metaverse just isn't it.\nMichael Calore: I agree with you.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I have a hard time with it. I know that even here at WIRED, we've written stories about this future world, this mirror world of computing that everything's going to be like ... I don't want to be close-minded and shut myself off to ideas around what the future of computing could look like just because I can't imagine it now, but I don't think that's it. I just think in its current form, it's like a layer of computing. It's not our primary computers, and it is, in the case of headsets, it is asking consumers to attach a computer to one of the most intimate parts of our bodies, one that fundamentally is where most of our senses are housed, and just shut ourselves off from the real world. I\u2014no pun intended\u2014can't really get my head around it.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, seriously, I agree with you completely. The fact that this stuff was developed for games says a lot, because it's great playing VR games if you're into VR games. They're a lot of fun. They are definitely very immersive. You have to take it off after half an hour, 45 minutes, because otherwise you start to get motion sick, but the idea that Meta has been pushing meetings in the metaverse and large-scale events in the metaverse\u2014those just do not feel fun. I would never wake up and say, \"Wow, I can't wait to go put on my headset and go sit in a meeting.\" There are certain things that just don't translate into that weird 3D world. I think the companies that are bullish on it are trying to push everything into that world. Really, it's a place for games. It's a place for hanging out, maybe being creative together with other people for a short period of time, but mostly, you're shooting zombies.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Recently, a bunch of WIRED folks tried to get together for a metaverse meetup with our headsets. I realized that day I was running from point A to B. I had to be here in the office for something. It was in the middle of the day. We don't have a Wi-Fi connection here in the office that allows outside devices on very easily. We have to authenticate for security reasons. I just said, \"I'm sorry, guys. I can't join this thing.\" Whereas every other device I carry with me allows me to do that now, allows me to have presence and have social presence when I need it, and then log off and see the world with my own two eyes when I need to. This idea of these headsets just doesn't do that. I really don't mean to sound like a Luddite, right? I admit I was a person, even when the iPhone first came out, I thought, \"Oh, I don't really love the touchscreen.\" I use a Blackberry. I want to type with the tactile keys, right? Then eventually, I came around to this new form of input and computing, and stuff like that happens all the time. We're resistant to change, I get it, but I don't know. The metaverse, I am very doubtful.Michael Calore: I mean, I think headsets are going to definitely stick around.\nLauren Goode: But for those specific use cases you talked about.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. We're going to keep seeing innovation in headsets, and soon, headsets are going to get small enough and light enough and wireless and powerful enough that you'll be able to do more things with them, but I still think that that doesn't matter. Like you're saying, the social awkwardness of having to put this thing on your face in order to interact with people is still too much of a hump to get over. I don't know if we're ever going to be able to make that hump small enough so that people will feel comfortable putting on a headset and then going into a social environment and not just killing zombies. So there's still going to be great game hardware. There's going to be all kinds of great games coming out, but yeah, meetings, boardrooms, horizon workrooms, all of that just feels like hot garbage. It really does. It feels like a giant waste of money.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, so back to Zoom for us, I guess.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Zoom technically is the metaverse, right?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I guess it is.\nMichael Calore: When you're in a Zoom meeting, you're technically in the metaverse according to the\u2014\nLauren Goode: I mean, if you use one of those 3D filters on your face, you are.\nMichael Calore: No, I mean, even the definition of a version of the internet that has presence and you're in a virtual space with somebody, that's what a Zoom room is, right?\nLauren Goode: Sure. So you've been telling me we've been living in the metaverse actually for about three years now.\nMichael Calore: Totally.\nLauren Goode: All right. I think we have time for one quick rapid-fire round of the future. We're going to make some future predictions. What's your big prediction for 2023?\nMichael Calore: My big prediction for 2023 is that we are going to have a reckoning with garbage.\nLauren Goode: Like the garbage on Twitter?\nMichael Calore: No, not the garbage on Twitter.\nLauren Goode: Darn.\nMichael Calore: I'm talking about the garbage out on your curb. So this has been coming from one direction for a while, and I think it's going to start coming from another direction next year. What I mean is for the past few years, companies like Apple and Samsung have been saying, \"We're going to stop putting chargers in the box. The boxes themselves are going to get smaller. We're going to expend less carbon getting your device to you, and it's going to have less garbage when it arrives,\" but I mean, there's still a ton of garbage in the world\u2014well, many, many tons of garbage in the world, but we do know that we produce an inordinate amount of trash in this country and in other industrialized countries. Most of the plastic that we produce is not recycled. It ends up in the environment, it breaks down. So we're starting to come to terms with the fact that we are producing mountains of this stuff. There are companies that are trying to turn garbage into things that can take the place of fossil fuels. So there are technologies like anaerobic digestion where they basically take garbage and they put a bunch of microbes in it. So they break it down and turn it into things that can replace fossil fuels. There is gasification, which uses garbage to make gas that can be used to generate electricity. There are other technologies that do similar things, basically replacing fossil fuels with these waste-to-energy fuels. So you can understand they have multiple benefits. It gets rid of waste so it doesn't go into landfills. It reduces a country's independence on fossil fuels, and for a country like the United States, it reduces our dependence on fuels that come from other countries like in the Middle East or South America or wherever. So I think the companies that are working in that space are going to have a very big year just because it feels like we're at that moment. I can't say, \"Oh, this is definitely going to happen.\" I just have a hunch that this tipping point has arrived and now is the time that you're going to see a lot of investment in that world in waste-to-energy.Lauren Goode: Well, I look forward to getting lots of editor's notes from you saying, \"This is trash,\" and meaning it literally.\nMichael Calore: \"Turn it into energy.\" What do you think is going to happen next year?\nLauren Goode: All right. So I don't mean to be all doom and gloom on this show because I've been like, \"Ah, the crypto market. Oh, metaverse, boo,\" but I do think that in 2023, we're going to see more belt-tightening across tech. I'm not an economist, but as we are taping this, the Federal Reserve just raised interest rates again by 50 basis points. Some of the more recent consumer price index data has been encouraging, but I don't think we're going to be able to say inflation is over, and a lot of tech companies have been looking at what's happening in the world right now and also reevaluating some of the hiring decisions they made during the pandemic when internet services became our lifelines, and they've been cutting back. I think we're going to continue to see this happen in 2023. It's a little bit scary for the rest of us when tech does this, because if companies like Meta are laying people off or Google is freezing hiring and they're not hurting for cash, then what does it mean for other industries? That doesn't necessarily mean things are totally dire. It could just mean that companies are narrowing their focus right now. They are whittling down all the different projects they're working on and figuring out the specific things that they want to build or invent. As our colleague Steven Levy pointed out in one of his recent newsletters, sometimes it's in a downturn that some of the most interesting new technology can emerge, because we identify problems, and tech sometimes does provide a solution as opposed to having all this tech exist that's in search of a problem. So maybe we'll see some interesting things emerge from this time period, this dip in our collective timeline, but I do think the belt-tightening is going to continue into 2023. That's my prediction, a fairly obvious one, I suppose.\nMichael Calore: Right. The economy isn't going to recover overnight.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I hate to break it to you.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, but I do think the time of free money is over, especially in Silicon Valley. So yeah, I think you're right.\nLauren Goode: We'll be keeping an eye on where we see the money going. If investors are looking to new areas, that might be interesting.\nMichael Calore: Maybe they want to look into waste-to-energy companies.\nLauren Goode: They might, W2E. You should put your deck together, Mike.\nMichael Calore: Or maybe they want to build a new headset, a VR headset.\nLauren Goode: Well, I don't know.\nMichael Calore: Because we need more of those.\nLauren Goode: Maybe not. All right. This has been really fun. Let's take a break and then we'll come back with our end-of-year recommendations.[Break]\nLauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: A crystal ball through which one can see the future. No. So I thought a little bit about this, and I decided that as ... we're doing year-end recommendations, right?\nLauren Goode: Sure. Maybe not a thing that you really enjoyed this week, but that made a difference in your year.\nMichael Calore: OK. So with that note, I would like to say, find a good, cheap, regularly-run foot race in your town. If you're a runner, if you want to get into running\u2014maybe your New Year's resolution is going to be to get into running\u2014one of the best motivating tools is to run a race. You can look around for races and often, you see the big races, the marathons, and they have a 5K component or the half-marathon, and there's a 10K component. Those are 70, 80 bucks usually to join, and they're quite complicated, and they're big crowded fields. Then there are these smaller races that take place in most big cities around the country and around the world that are run more regularly. Maybe they happen once a month. Maybe there's a monthly 5K that your library puts on or a quarterly 10K or a trail race or something like that that's sponsored by some local nonprofit. Those races are great because they're cheap. They usually cost under $20 to enter and to run, and they're very mellow. So they're very low stress events. They tend to start at more reasonable times. It's like 9 am instead of 7:45 or 7:30 am. So Lauren, you and I are exercise buddies. We do a lot of exercise activities together on the weekends.\nLauren Goode: This is what I like to say\u2014we record a podcast that none of you will ever hear because we don't actually record it.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. So we run together.\nLauren Goode: We run.\nMichael Calore: We go on bike rides, things like that.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. We hash through the news of the day.\nMichael Calore: One thing that we did this year was we did the Lake Merritt race.\nLauren Goode: Super fun.\nMichael Calore: In Oakland, 5K, super fun, 50 people, $10. It was amazing.\nLauren Goode: I won second place.\nMichael Calore: Yes, you did. You won second place.\nLauren Goode: Because there were three women in my age group. Super fun.\nMichael Calore: So that's my recommendation. If you want to get into running or if you are a runner, don't just concentrate on the big races. Try to find some small community run event because it's a great motivating tool knowing that, \"OK. In three weeks, I have to do this again,\" or, \"In six weeks, I have to do this again.\" It keeps you going.\nLauren Goode: It's a nice little training race if you are planning on doing a longer run at some point.Michael Calore: That's right.\nLauren Goode: Great recommendation.\nMichael Calore: Thanks. What's yours?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is something that I've recommended at some point on this show, and I think it was this year. Get into meditation if you can. I recommend checking out Tara Brach. That's B-R-A-C-H. She puts a lot of free meditation exercises and lectures on her podcast. Apple Podcasts is what I use, but you can find her anywhere. They're free. She accepts donations on her website. She is a really wonderful meditation teacher. She also does some work sometimes with Jack Kornfield, another well-known meditation teacher. I've also been listening to some of his. You can find so many options for meditation. The ones I'm describing are guided in which you hear someone in your ear, in your earpods, guiding you through breathing exercises and mental exercises. You can also just listen to ones that offer ambient noise or nature sounds and you don't hear someone speaking if that's more soothing to you. Even if you happen to be a Peloton subscriber, they have great 10-minute meditation exercises in their app. Some people really dig 10% Happier as an option for meditation or learning more about meditation. I just recommend getting some headspace back if you can, and not to stress about whether you're doing it right. Your mind is going to wander when you're doing it, and that's fine. Just accept it and get yourself back on track if you can.\nMichael Calore: That's a place where I think guided meditation really helps.\nLauren Goode: I agree.\nMichael Calore: Because you ask somebody, \"Well, how do you meditate?\" and they say, \"Well, it's easy. You just sit there and you think about nothing.\"\nLauren Goode: Yeah, but it's not it. That's not how our brains work, especially our Twitter adult brains.\nMichael Calore: Yes. So a guided meditation is going to fill your head with imagery and give you prompts that are structured to cool you down and bring you into that headspace instead of just trying to force it.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Sometimes they will guide you through a body scan, although it was really funny. One of my friends the other night said, \"If I get told to do a body scan one more time,\" because there's over-reliance on that, I suppose. It really puts you in your body. There are all kinds of ways of just finding a little more presence, giving yourself some headspace, taking a break from the noise, and taking a break from social media. Very important.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. I feel like we should take a break from this podcast.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. We're going to take a little holiday break and we'll be back in the new year with new stuff.\nMichael Calore: That's right. We have CES the first week of January.\nLauren Goode: Oh, boy, CES. So you're going to be podcasting from a hotel room in Las Vegas.Michael Calore: Yes. Our first show of the year will probably be the crew at WIRED who's at CES talking about CES.\nLauren Goode: That's going to be pretty exciting.\nMichael Calore: That's all I know right now.\nLauren Goode: All right. TBD. Well, Mike, thanks so much for being an amazing cohost all year.\nMichael Calore: Thank you for being an amazing cohost all year.\nLauren Goode: I just saw in the script that you wrote, \"I quit.\"\nMichael Calore: I don't quit.\nLauren Goode: Please don't quit. Please, please don't quit.\nMichael Calore: Absolutely not.\nLauren Goode: OK. Good. Whew. All right. My prediction is that Mike sticks around for the entirety of 2023. Thank you, and thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter. We're still there. Just check the show notes. Our producer is the excellent Boone Ashworth, whom we're extremely grateful for. We'll be back next week, the first week of January, with that new episode that Mike mentioned. Until then, have a good rest of your year and a happy holiday season.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63a4b9e3460886d10ec90365\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Gear-metaverse-1434700854.jpg","author":"BY WIRED STAFF","title":"Is It 2023 Yet?","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/gadget-lab-podcast-579\/","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","METAVERSE","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","TWITTER","TRASH"]},{"date":"12.26.2022","summary":"From SBF to the GRU, these were the most disruptive forces of online chaos this year.","post_content":"RUSSIAN SOLDIERS POURED into Ukraine, accompanied by a wave of cyberattacks across the country. A major cryptocurrency exchange imploded and declared bankruptcy, vaporizing billions of dollars from that digital economy. The once-biggest dark-web drug market\u2014after being demolished by law enforcement\u2014clawed back to the top of the online underworld after doggedly resurrecting itself.\nIt's not 2014, though you could be forgiven for being confused. No, all these episodes of global chaos occurred in 2022, each one a rerun of previous events, but now with the threat they posed vastly multiplied in scale.\nThis year, some of the phantoms of the Trump era and the Covid-19 pandemic finally seemed to recede\u2014only to make room for new threats and the return of ghosts of years past. The same dictators\u2014Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un\u2014who have long threatened the global order, their geographic neighbors, and their countries' own citizens. Fresher digital threats like India's slide into online repression, and brazen cybercriminals displaying more ruthlessness than ever. And then there were some vestiges of the Trump era that seemed to have hung on, such as one particularly loud and quixotic billionaire with a large, cultlike following, seemingly doing his best to singlehandedly corrupt social media.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nEvery year, WIRED assembles a list of the most dangerous people on the internet. For the first time since 2015, Donald Trump doesn't top this list. But there's no shortage of new sources of instability and disruption online. Here are our picks for 2022.\nSam Bankman-Fried\nFor its entire existence, the cryptocurrency world has been plagued with money laundering, theft, and scams, from Bitcoin-powered dark-web drug markets to billions of dollars stolen from crypto companies by rogue hackers. But one of the most dangerous players in the crypto economy, it seems, was hiding in plain sight. In the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, a poster boy for cryptocurrency\u2019s growing legitimacy, Sam Bankman-Fried, now stands accused of more than $8 billion in fraud. The rippling fallout for the cryptocurrency economy could be far larger, and the tangled dealings and mismanagement of user funds in FTX's meltdown have yet to be fully unraveled\u2014even the company's new CEO John Ray, who also handled the bankruptcy of Enron, says he's never seen a bigger mess. Under Bankman-Fried's hands-on leadership, FTX invested vast sums of users' cryptocurrency in his own trading platform Alameda Research, which has also gone bankrupt. Aside from those enormous losses, Bankman-Fried represents a particularly troubling figure for the ills of the crypto economy: Unlike so many others in the crypto world, he had appeared to actually welcome tighter government controls of the industry. Now, like a hybrid of Elizabeth Holmes and Lehman Brothers, he's come to represent the face of regulatory capture.\nElon Musk\nThe antics of Elon Musk, as a Willy Wonka figure with his mercuriality dialed up to 11, seemed harmless enough\u2014or possibly even a net good for human progress\u2014when he was focused on next-generation rockets and electric cars. But with his acquisition of Twitter, the dark side of Musk was put on display, and the fickle power of the (sometimes) world's richest man suddenly threatened a central institution of the internet. Musk's immediate, summary layoffs of thousands of Twitter's staffers put at risk key functions of a service that serves as a central artery of digital conversation. Sure, he justified lifting Twitter's ban on neo-Nazis like Andrew Anglin as well as former president Donald Trump (after the latter was removed from Twitter after using it to incite the January 6 riots and invasion of the US Capitol building) with free speech arguments. But Twitter's new emperor has also decimated its staff of content moderators, leading to situations like a single staffer being left to police child abuse content on Twitter for all of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. Under Musk's watch, Twitter has also banned left-wing accounts he described as \"antifa,\" contradicting his stance on free speech. Just days after the acquisition, Musk briefly tweeted\u2014then deleted\u2014disinformation that the man who attacked US House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband in October was his gay lover. Later, he seemed to call for the prosecution of the White House\u2019s chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, without explanation. In doing so, he offered a glimpse of the conspiracy-minded politics and trolling that truly drive his actions. Twitter hasn't collapsed under Musk, as some of its doomsayers predicted. But it may be morphing into the worst version of itself.\nXi Jinping\nXi Jinping has presided over some of China's worst human rights abuses, including its mass internment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and the crackdown on protestors in Hong Kong. Each of those waves of repression has come with its own accompanying tightening of restrictions online, as censors scoured social media for any reference to protests and Han Chinese police in Xinjiang even demanded that Uyghurs download an app that scans their phones for banned content. This year, the protests against China's draconian zero-Covid lockdowns have triggered a new online crackdown, one in which even \"liking\" a post about protests is deemed illegal and signs of misbehavior are tracked in a regulated \"credit system\" that can lead to users being summarily banned from online platforms. Xi has already established himself as the most powerful figure in China's government in decades, taking an unprecedented third term as head of the Chinese Communist Party. He's made clear that authoritarian power will extend deep into the digital lives of the world's biggest population of internet users.\nNarendra Modi\nUnder Modi and his party, the BJP, India has become increasingly China-like in its repression of protests both physical and digital. In just the past few years, the Indian government temporarily shut down the internet in the embattled region of Kashmir, banned a large collection of China-based apps including TikTok, and just weeks ago delegated oversight of content moderation decisions on social media to a three-person group\u2014a move widely seen as the latest step in the government's attempts to tighten its grip on those platforms. In perhaps the most appalling case of digital repression, security researchers this year revealed that hackers who fabricated evidence on the computers of activists in the region near the city of Pune had ties to the very same Pune police who arrested those activists. One of the activists targeted in that frame job died in detention. Eleven other defendants in the case remain in jail. Modi's India has proven that even a so-called democracy offers no guarantees of a remotely free internet.\nGRU\nRussia's GRU military intelligence agency has, for years, been home to some of the most aggressive and dangerous hackers in the world. The GRU groups known as Sandworm and APT28 have, in just the past seven years, triggered two blackouts in Ukraine, launched the hack-and-leak operation designed to sway the US 2016 election, released the NotPetya malware that spread worldwide and caused at least $10 billion in damage, and tried to destroy the backend of the 2018 Olympics. In 2022, thanks to Russia's unprovoked and brutal war in Ukraine, the GRU's focus zeroed in again on the country that has long been Russia's favorite hacking victim. In 2022, it launched countless cyberattacks designed to destroy data on Ukrainian government and corporate networks, often in tandem with physical attacks carried out by the invasion forces. One GRU malware attack went so far as to disable communications to 5,000 wind turbines across Germany in a case of collateral damage reminiscent of NotPetya. The GRU's Sandworm hackers also attempted a third blackout attack in Ukraine, which\u2014according to Ukraine's government at least\u2014defenders managed to foil this time. A+ for continued wanton, reckless aggression. B- for execution.\nDeSnake\nWhen the dark-web market for drugs and hacked data known as AlphaBay was shut down in 2017 and its creator Alexandre Cazes was found dead in a Thai jail cell, it seemed the story of AlphaBay was over. Then, in the summer of last year, fully four years after that massive bust, AlphaBay relaunched under the command of its cofounder and Cazes' top lieutenant, known only as DeSnake. In the year-plus since then, DeSnake has dragged AlphaBay back to the top of the dark web's competing scrum of criminal markets. To his credit, he's set more rules for what can be sold on his black market than Cazes ever did, banning the sale of fentanyl and ransomware tools, for instance. But AlphaBay remains a bustling criminal bazaar for hard drugs and stolen data, and it may be harder to shut down than ever. DeSnake has implemented security upgrades to the site, such as allowing only the harder-to-trace cryptocurrency Monero instead of Bitcoin. And he also claims to be located in the former Soviet Union\u2014potentially putting him far farther beyond the reach of law enforcement than his unlucky predecessor.\nLazarus\nIn 2022, North Korea continued to distinguish itself as the world's top perpetrator of state-sponsored cybercrime: Its government hackers continued to steal hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loot, largely in the form of cryptocurrency, from targets around the globe. That spree of burglaries actually seems to be escalating. According to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, North Korean thieves took in $840 million in the first five months of 2022 alone, more than the previous two years combined. Some $600 million of that came from just one heist. All of it goes toward funding one of the worst regimes in the world, with hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in concentration camps and a tendency to fire missiles over its neighbors' heads.\nConti\nThe scourge of ransomware continued to plague the world in 2022, and no group illustrated that threat better than Conti. In the first months of the year, the group hit dozens of corporate and government targets. Most catastrophically, it launched a wave of crippling cyberattacks across Costa Rica, shutting down 27 government bodies and medical services there and leading to a national state of emergency. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Conti declared its full support for that war\u2014a decision that led to one of its disgruntled members leaking a vast trove of the group's internal communications online. Conti has subsequently shut down, but likely only in name. Its hackers may have rebranded and splintered, but the chaos that is their business model will no doubt persist.\nLapsus$\nThe only thing more dangerous than a group of ruthless ransomware hackers is a group of ruthless ransomware hackers who are also teenagers. In December of 2021, Lapsus$ made its entrance onto the hacking scene with a cyberattack on the Brazilian Ministry of Health in the midst of its Covid-19 response. It's since carried out a spree of splashy, often nihilistic breaches of major tech firms including Uber, Okta, Rockstar Games, Nvidia, Microsoft, Samsung, and Vodafone. Last spring, British law enforcement arrested seven people suspected of being members of the group, all ages 16 to 21. Those arrests included Lapsus$'s alleged 16-year-old \"mastermind.\" But inexplicably, those suspects were released without charges, and the group's \"hacker joyride\" rolls on.\nAPT41\nFor years, China's hackers focused on by-the-book espionage. But more recently, one group, known as APT41, has proven itself to be the closest thing China has to North Korean state-sponsored cybercriminals. That group, which the US Department of Justice tied in an indictment to the Ministry of State Security contractor known as Chengdu 404, has for years moonlighted as a for-profit cybercriminal outfit. Just this month, the group was linked to the theft of $20 million in Covid-19 relief funds, an unprecedented robbery of US government money by a Chinese state-sponsored hacking outfit. Meanwhile, APT41 was also responsible for dozens of espionage-focused intrusions across the world this year, according to analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which calls the group the most prolific cyberspying operation in the world. Despite the Justice Department charging seven of the group's members in 2020, they remain at large, and their unique blend of espionage and outright theft continues unabated.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/639a14bdb574bf8e5260748f\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/YearEndReview_Most-Dangerous-People.jpg","author":"BY WIRED STAFF","title":"The Most Dangerous People on the Internet in 2022","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/most-dangerous-people-on-the-internet-2022\/","tags":["","HACKING","SECURITY","RUSSIA","RANSOMWARE","BITCOIN","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED","ELON MUSK"]},{"date":"12.22.2022","summary":"The market for non-fungible tokens took a nosedive this year.

Using his quant and coding skills instead of a bow-and-arrow, he built, at breakneck speed, a $32 billion empire: the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, and the trading firm Alameda Research. But it was all supposedly for the cause of giving to the poor (via the fashionable new movement, effective altruism)\u2014with former Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison acting as his Maid Marian and a stunning roster of A-listers (from top Democrats to star sportspersons) his Merry Men. Yet, since being escorted out of his Caribbean home in handcuffs on December 12, he has appeared a distinctly less cheerful outlaw. \nSo how did our self-proclaimed modern-day Robin Hood, who agreed to extradition to the US earlier this week, come to end up in chains? \nThe answer is foreshadowed by another \u201Cethical crusader\u201D who, a little over a decade ago, experimented with his own philanthropic fantasy on the other side of the globe: Vikram Akula and his microfinance initiative. Microfinance refers to institutions that provide financial services, especially small (\u201Cmicro\u201D) loans, to people not normally able to access credit from conventional banks\u2014typically poor women, often in rural areas. The concept of microfinance, and the first microfinance institution, the Grameen Bank, had been established in the 1970s by economist Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh and had gradually grown to boast millions of borrowers in the country and all over the world\u2014winning Yunus and his not-for-profit bank the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for contributions to global poverty eradication. \nFEATURED VIDEO\nMemory Champion Answers Questions From Twitter\nAkula, raised in the US, wanted to import the business acumen he\u2019d acquired as a management consultant at McKinsey\u2014his equivalent of Robin Hood\u2019s archery\u2014to the microfinance model in his ancestral homeland, India: specifically, by speeding the process up to bring the logic of fast-scaling consumer brands, like Coca-Cola or McDonald\u2019s, into play. He established his own company, SKS Microfinance, in 1997 to do so. Fueled by the idea that the more rapidly Akula\u2019s company expanded, the more good it could do, SKS quickly became one of the fastest growing institutions in the sector\u2019s history, and Akula the bold new global face of microfinance\u2014making, for instance, the Time magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People of 2006. By 2010, an SKS IPO, as apparent proof of the pudding of profit-with-a-purpose, was 14-times oversubscribed. \nSUBSCRIBE\nSubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.\nThe similarities between FTX and SKS go beyond the rebel-with-a-cause personal trajectories of their founders. Like Robin Hood and his followers\u2019 noble cat-and-mouse game with the tyrannical Sheriff, both men operated on the fringes of the law in the liminal extralegal space between legal and not, with SBF working in the unregulated crypto industry and Akula in the mostly unregulated South Asian microfinance sector. (In 2010, Akula, too, had an arrest warrant issued against him, although with \u201Csheriffs\u201D in India being what they are, he was never arrested.) And both were motivated, notionally\u2014much as \u201Cman of the people\u201D Robin Hood\u2014by the democratizing zeal of giving power to the people. \nIndeed, the original models of crypto and microfinance had much in common. Crypto is a decentralized digital currency (including, for instance, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, and Dogecoin) traded on crypto exchanges (like Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and, until recently, FTX, as well as some brokerage platforms like Robinhood, Webull, and eToro). Unlike conventional \u201Cfiat currencies\u201D issued by governments, crypto isn\u2019t backed by any physical assets: Its value is conjured entirely by common consent. Because transactions (\u201Cblocks\u201D) are verified and recorded (in a continuous link, or \u201Cchain\u201D) in code known as a blockchain\u2014the equivalent of a checkbook distributed across an infinity of computers across the world\u2014it is considered open, diffuse, and consensus-driven: the ultimate peoples\u2019 ledger, or an opportunity for millions of ordinary people to co-author their own collective financial story.\nThe microfinance model, on the other hand, is notable for providing loans without either contracts or collateral, but instead through \u201Cgroup lending\u201D or organizing borrowers into supportive peer groups, usually of five\u2014significantly widening the radius of finance by allowing virtually anyone (even those without legal or financial assets) to access credit, making it the quintessential people\u2019s bank. Despite the absence of the usual punitive mechanisms, and, again, lending backed by physical assets (collateral), microfinance institutions remarkably achieve and maintain extremely high repayment rates\u2014regularly over 95 percent, reportedly\u2014by means of consensus or common consent among borrowers. At the heart of both are peer-to-peer relationships and dynamics that replace finance\u2019s traditional hierarchies, akin to Robin Hood\u2019s commitment to redistribution as financial justice. Cryptocurrency and microfinance\u2014cousin experiments in decentralized and inclusive finance, respectively\u2014challenge top-down institutions like banks and governments by not only drawing ordinary people into its remit but also, in theory, placing them at the wheel (the community \u201Cverifies\u201D transactions in the crypto model and monitors lending via \u201Cpeer-monitoring\u201D in microfinance). Despite their many detractors, they succeeded in defying conventional wisdom to become multibillion-dollar industries, receiving the blessings and backing of some of the world\u2019s most highly respected investors. Each, in turn, was anointed by reference venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, established by \u201Cgodfather\u201D of Silicon Valley Don Valentine.\nAnd in both instances, actors once deemed its \u201Cgolden boys\u201D almost single-handedly destabilized the prospects of the entire sector, demonstrating their frailty. The hubris of both FTX and SKS in developing highly streamlined versions of their products was that they were working with a universal scaling formula\u2014a mechanical substitute for trust\u2014allowing for infinitely rapid growth. Indeed, Satoshi Nakamoto, in outlining the proposal for the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2014speculated to be in part a response to the excesses of the 2008 financial crisis\u2014explicitly described the technology as being \u201Cbased on cryptographic proof instead of trust.\u201D Similarly, Akula set out to develop what he referred to as the \u201CStarbucks version\u201D of microfinance. FTX derived its confidence from the halo-effect of blockchain code being deemed incorruptible while SKS operated on the assumption that the signature high repayment rates of microfinance were based on a cold, economic cost-benefit analysis on the part of borrowers. \nThey were wrong.\nAs the Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist and high priestess of informality Elinor Ostrom established, the peer-to-peer mechanisms at the core of both models can be highly resilient. But their success lies in their communitarian calculus (relationships of trust and reciprocity between participants and the institution), which makes participants feel invested. Social identity was a key part of what made both crypto and microfinance work. Women in India\u2014like their 15 or so million compatriots in Bangladesh\u2014paid their loans back largely because that\u2019s what it meant to belong. One in five Americans report having traded cryptocurrency, with 33 percent of those in crypto circles citing \u201Cwanting to be a part of a community\u201D as at least a minor reason for investing. The secret ingredient that congeals any institution\u2014but especially an informal one, like Robin Hood and his band\u2014is solidarity within the group and faith in the morality of its mission: in these cases, correctives to the injustices of mainstream finance. SBF and Akula understood IT and business, but not the technology of trust. \nIn the early 2000s, Joseph Stiglitz (another Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist) and I detected the incipient \u201Cirrational exuberance\u201D in the microfinance sector and predicted that the bubble was likely to burst on the basis that SKS was undermining the very thing that had made microfinance tick\u2014trust\u2014by \u201Cmass manufacturing\u201D it at a pace and profit margin that crowded out the moral incentives of borrowers. In November 2010, anticipating events 12 years later at FTX, this played out: Soon after its explosive burst of growth, SKS faced a wave of defections in the form of mass defaults\u2014an unhappy first in the industry\u2019s history. Regulators, who had struggled to keep up with the novel developments of the sector, scrambled to take action, introducing draconian legislation. And so Akula\u2019s experiment ended up in the \u201Csheriff\u2019s\u201D shackles after all. The lasting legacy of the Indian microfinance crisis, barely reported in the international media, was 10 million women being designated defaulters and denied access to credit in the future, potentially for the rest of their lives. Those handed the tab for Akula\u2019s great gamble were the very people in whose name he acted: the common person. Meanwhile, this November, a tweet by the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, prompted a run on FTT, the FTX token, ultimately exposing the rot at the core of the organization and revealing an $8-billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet, potentially leaving 1 million of its customers\u2014ordinary people\u2014once again holding the bill. \nSKS changed microfinance irrevocably, shattering the fragile equilibrium of goodwill that long sustained it. FTX, for better or for worse, promises to do the same for the crypto industry. In light of corporate restructuring expert and Enron veteran John Jay Ray III\u2019s testimony before the US House of Representatives on Bankman-Fried\u2019s Bernie Madoff\u2013style \u201Cold-fashioned embezzlement,\u201D SBF is starting to look less like a heroic outlaw and more like a garden-variety bandit. But from the FTX scandal\u2014which is likely to join the ranks of \u201Cone of the biggest frauds in American financial history\u201D\u2014to the SKS debacle, one of the biggest mass defaults in history, the lesson is clear: The key thing about a people\u2019s institution is that you have to retain the trust of the people. Otherwise, one goes from being Robin Hood to, at best, the prince of thieves.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63a2366d2b5612eae8066cbc\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/ftx-finance-sam-bankman-fried.jpg","author":"BY ANTARA HALDAR","title":"The Case That Foreshadowed the Lessons of the FTX Collapse","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/cryptocurrency-sbf-ftx-microfinance\/","tags":["","CRYPTO","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","MONEY","PSYCHOLOGY","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]},{"date":"12.20.2022","summary":"Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter takeover is a case study in destruction.

There\u2019s a small roundabout at the center, a gas station, a tiny shopping complex, and a cluster of modest buildings topped by terra-cotta roof tiles. Rippling green slopes of banana, palm, and pine fan out behind, houses dotted among the hills. All of this is surrounded by dramatic escarpment and made subtropically lush by the many small waterfalls that gurgle from the rock face, filling centuries-old irrigation canals. When Gonçalo Hall first drove through the area in September 2020, the words that came into his mind were: \u201CWhat the fuck is this?\u201D\nPonta do Sol is on the southern coast of Madeira, the main island of the Portuguese archipelago of the same name. Hall had visited Madeira once as a kid, but he didn\u2019t remember it being so beautiful, so wild. Now, as he put it in an interview, he was seeing the place \u201Cwith the eyes of a digital nomad.\u201D He had returned to help run a conference about remote work in Madeira\u2019s regional capital, Funchal. The day after his long drive through the countryside, he approached the regional secretary of economy and asked point-blank: Why are you sleeping on digital nomads?\nHall, 35, is tall and husky, with blond hair, blue eyes, a jovial demeanor, and a proclivity for speaking in hashtag mantras like \u201Clife is good\u201D or \u201Cbe happy, make millions.\u201D He grew up in Lapa, the poshest area of Lisbon, but now keeps an apartment in Ponta do Sol with his wife, Catarina: Lisbon, he complained when we first met, had become too much of a melting pot. Hall had long dreamed of finding a lifestyle where he could show up to work in flip-flops and shorts rather than the suits and ties of the bankers in his family. In early 2019, the couple moved to Bali for two months, where Hall picked up his first remote contracts, including a marketing gig for a firm called Remote-how, and amassed a hefty contact list in the process. Then they went to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Bali again, spending a month or two in each before returning to Europe.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nWhy Billionaires Are Actually Ruining the Economy\nBack in Lisbon, after less than a year of the digital nomad lifestyle, Hall was organizing conferences about remote work and digital nomadism, self-identifying as an expert on both. When he landed in Madeira, he took in its low cost of living, fast internet speeds, surfable beaches, and Instagrammable beauty\u2014the pillars of digital nomad marketing. He recognized something else as well in the pastoral pace. A small nomad project that he had visited in rural Spain, just before his arrival in the archipelago, had impressed him; it was charming, more intimate than the bustling urban hubs he had experienced so far.\nEstablished digital nomad hot spots, like Chiang Mai, Thailand, or Canggu, Bali, tend to be bubbles where wealthy and overwhelmingly white foreigners cluster at coffee shops, coworking spaces, and other businesses that cater to their wants and comforts in English. If he built a destination for digital nomads in small-town Madeira, Hall thought, things would be different. Itinerant remote workers could live just like locals, alongside locals: They could reside in the same neighborhoods, eat at the same restaurants, and mingle at gatherings coordinated by a \u201Ccommunity manager.\u201D Hall decided to pitch his idea to the Madeiran government.\nIt was an easy sell. Tourism in the archipelago had plummeted due to the Covid-19 travel bans that had barred travelers from outside of Europe\u2019s Schengen Area, and so Hall framed digital nomads as the cure. Portugal\u2019s urban centers were already saturated with remote workers, but Madeira, less than a two-hour flight from Lisbon, was still under the radar. High-earning professionals could pour money into local businesses, Hall told regional officials. All they needed to welcome them was an inviting infrastructure and a ready-made network to land in. If he built it, Hall promised, they would come. A meeting was arranged with Madeira\u2019s regional president, Miguel Albuquerque, and \u201Cafter two or three beers,\u201D Albuquerque recalled later, \u201Cthe deal was sealed.\u201D StartUp Madeira, a regional business incubator, was enrolled to manage the project, Hall was hired to lead, and the coastal parish of Ponta do Sol, population 4,300, was selected as the location for an experiment that looked a little bit like tourism, a little bit like a future-of-work demo, a little bit like selective immigration\u2014and a lot like a test for a strained local housing market. The project was perhaps an inevitable extension of mainland Portugal\u2019s eager embrace of foreign remote workers, itself part of a global expansion of digital-nomad-friendly legislation and of the private industries attending to their needs. It was ironic, in a way: While the pandemic had closed borders for so many, it had created financial incentives to open them to others. \nWHEN THE DIGITAL Nomad Village officially launched in February 2021, there were a small handful of inaugural residents. They included Kamil Kokot, a Polish software developer; his sister; two German men they\u2019d arranged to rent a house with via Slack; and Hall himself. There was a local 7 pm curfew then, but after months of being grounded by Covid, the newcomers were thrilled to be in a new place among new people. By spring, the Village had swelled to 50, and Kokot felt he had begun to make a tight-knit group of friends. They threw him a surprise birthday party in May, then celebrated out-of-season Christmas, Halloween, and New Year\u2019s Eve together in the weeks that followed. They set off fireworks on the beach just before curfew one warm spring night, giddily sipping on champagne while bewildered residents of Ponta do Sol watched from their homes. At the end of June, a group of these newfound friends traveled to the Azores for a happy holiday together, then scattered. Some, like Kokot, returned the following winter. Madeira, he told me, was the first place outside Poland where he could imagine making a home.\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERSBy the time I visited in February 2022, the pilot project was a year old. An estimated 200 international remote workers were staying in rentals in the Ponta do Sol parish and larger municipality. At least 1,000 more had snapped up rooms, apartments, and villas elsewhere on the island\u2014in some cases because the stock had been exhausted or priced too high in Ponta do Sol. Many came through town to cowork or attend the yoga classes, workshops, and other events that pack the Digital Nomad Village\u2019s calendar.\nThe ocean views from the outdoor workspace are stunning, but even in the shade, it\u2019s often too bright to see your screen.\nOne of those events, a weekly \u201Ccommunity lunch,\u201D is held every Wednesday at a restaurant near the coworking space. The day I joined, some 30-odd remote workers gathered at Steak & Sun, where the kitchen staff have learned to make vegetarian and vegan dishes for their new clientele. Submitting a 🐠 on a Slack post claimed an order of bacalhau a bras, a non-alcoholic beverage, and an espresso for \u20AC9. At my table were Hall and his wife, an arts administrator from Lithuania, a startup cofounder from the UK, several software developers from Germany, and one from Scotland.\nMelissa and João Cabral, siblings from Calheta, the next town over, approached the group and introduced themselves in English. \u201CWe\u2019re locals,\u201D Melissa said, \u201Cwould it be OK if we joined?\u201D The people seated around me let out an enthusiastic yes, motioning for them to sit, sit, please sit. As the siblings settled into their seats, Hall announced that they were the very first locals to join community lunch. The Cabrals couldn\u2019t hide their surprise.\nBoth Cabrals were in marketing and worked remotely. They had visited the coworking space that morning, when Hall told them about the lunch. Melissa was initially hesitant. \u201CYou see the word \u2018digital nomads\u2019 so you think, \u2018it\u2019s not for us,\u2019\u201D she said, a sentiment later echoed by several other locals I spoke with. But she was a remote worker in Madeira too, and networking with entrepreneurs and people with international connections could be useful, so she decided to come. Melissa posed a question to the table: \u201CDo you think it\u2019s important to connect with locals?\u201D Hall responded with a quick and firm yes, absolutely. That would be the next phase of the project, he said. Covid, he offered, had so far made it impossible.\nThe siblings later told me that they were floored by the warm reception. A cluster of curious travelers surrounded them after lunch, asking questions, extending dinner invitations, encouraging them to use the coworking space, and insisting that they return. They said they would. Still, Melissa said, if she and her brother were the first locals to join, then clearly \u201Csomething is not working that well.\u201D\nTHE DIGITAL NOMAD Village is not a physical village, of course. It is a marketing pitch and a virtual infrastructure that facilitates the mutual interaction of international remote workers, superimposed and dependent on the actual, centuries-old village of Ponta do Sol. The closest the Digital Nomad Village has to a physical structure is the free coworking space, an area on loan at the John Dos Passos Cultural Center, one of the few modern buildings in town. Downstairs, locals meet up for film screenings, dance rehearsals, and photo exhibitions. Upstairs, foreign remote workers gather to gaze at their laptops and take Zoom meetings in the courtyard. On my visits, I noticed that the desks inside were always claimed first: The ocean views from the outdoor workspace are stunning, but even in the shade, it\u2019s often too bright to see your screen.Very few people I met in the Village embraced the term \u201Cdigital nomad.\u201D The label is taken up most enthusiastically by those who make their money off it. In this definition, digital nomads are freelancers and entrepreneurs who explore the world, untethered to corporate offices, long apartment leases, and car payments, and who stay for weeks or months or longer\u2014just not long enough to be liable to pay taxes. In Portugal, the lines that divide digital nomads from foreign remote workers from expats from immigrants from working holidayers are often fuzzed: Portuguese officials don\u2019t hide their desire to transform this particular class of wanderers into settlers.\nThe national government has so far had very little basis for guessing how many itinerant remote workers pass through the country each year, where they come from, what they do, how long they stay, how they live, or even what measurable impact or contributions they make to the broader economy or social life of the country. StartUp Madeira started compiling its own statistics after the launch of the Digital Nomad Village experiment, counting the arrival of more than 8,000 remote workers to the archipelago so far\u2014but that\u2019s still little more than an estimate, and likely a low one. The numbers are based solely on the number of people who register through StartUp Madeira's website.\nPonta do Sol is sold as a place you can call home, while ushering in the displacement of the people who have called it home for generations.\nThe Madeira Islands Slack, the virtual dimension of the Nomad Village, is by turns awkward, dull, and chaotic. Nomads who work as coaches regularly offer circles and paid workshops for breath work, bodywork, shadow work, heart opening, and chakra meditation. I saw advertisements for a photo-hiking workshop to shoot models in the forest, a combination photoshoot-therapy session in the mountains, and an NFT-themed connection retreat for women. Every week a new flyer announces the DJ lineup for Purple Friday, a raucous party at a cliffside hotel that keeps separate invite lists for international and local guests. (\u201CMadeira,\u201D Kokot told me, \u201Cwas the first place for me to have party social fatigue.\u201D)\nAfter the community lunch I attended, the Scotsman tagged all 6,000-plus Slack users in a note asking who was up for a coffee, inviting an intercontinental pile-on. A year into the project, the few pinned posts were outdated, leaving a gaping blank where documentation or collective memory should have gone. A central FAQ was posted more recently, but for the first year and a half the same questions were posted again and again: Does anyone know of a room to rent? Is there a bus to Funchal? Where do I rent a car? How do I book a desk at the coworking space? Any recommendations for vegan food? How can I find an apartment? Hey, anyone know if there\u2019s a bus to Funchal?\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERSSeveral of the temporary residents of Ponta do Sol told me they\u2019d looked forward to the Digital Nomad Village\u2019s potential for small-town community but were disappointed after they arrived by how little meaningful interaction there was with Madeirans. They tried to find their own ways to seek out connection with locals: getting to know café and restaurant staff by name, riding public transportation, volunteering at the dog shelter, learning Portuguese, joining pickup soccer games. Some contemplated settling in Madeira longer term. A couple of them initiated meetups with Madeiran social entrepreneurs. But these were outliers.\nDespite Hall\u2019s stated intentions, the design of the Village, the itinerant core of its lifestyle, and the consequences of bringing in so many people so quickly have made the promised \u201Ccommunity\u201D complicated to deliver. StartUp Madeira\u2019s promotional video for the project sells Ponta do Sol as a place you can call home\u2014a shallow vision of belonging that demands no commitments and carries no burden or history\u2014all while ushering in the displacement of the people who have called it home for generations before your arrival. In this telling, guests don\u2019t owe their hosts a thing. It is a familiar story.\nIN THE 15TH century, when the Portuguese first landed on Madeira\u2019s shores, the island was uninhabited by humans, thick with forest cover, and abundant with life. The conquistadors didn\u2019t name Madeira after what they saw growing there: trees, green, woods, forest, jungle\u2014árvores, verde, bosque, floresta, selva. They named it after the commodity those trees could become once they were razed: wood, timber, lumber\u2014madeira, madeira, madeira. Fires were set to clear land for settlement and cash crop agriculture, burning for seven years straight, as the legend goes.\nMany of Ponta do Sol\u2019s residents still work in agriculture; sugarcane has been grown here from its earliest settlement, though banana cultivation now dominates. People here are, on average, poorer than the rest of the island, which is itself poorer than the rest of Portugal, the poorest country in southwestern Europe. During my visit, I perused an exhibition at the John Dos Passos Cultural Center featuring photos taken during the miserable four-decade-long Estado Novo dictatorship: dirt roads, shoeless peasants, grass-thatched huts, aching poverty. When the colony of Madeira won its autonomy in 1975, after the fall of the fascist regime, 60 percent of the archipelago\u2019s population was illiterate.\nMadeira has built a robust tourism industry in the decades since. Most of the bookable beds in Ponta do Sol are in private homes called \u201CAlojamento Local,\u201D which are subject to different regulations than the long-term rentals sought by locals, and exponentially more profitable. Hall says he wants 100 beds in the area to be secured exclusively for digital nomad rentals, and he and his business partner Dave Williams are trying to incentivize property owners\u2014including the growing numbers of foreigners who have invested in real estate here\u2014to jump on board.\nWilliams, who started NomadX, originally a midterm accommodations business, with help from StartUp Lisbon, now partners with Airbnb rival Flatio. I attended one of the Flatio info sessions Hall and Williams cohosted for prospective landlords\u2014held entirely in English\u2014where Hall waxed on about the desirable demographic profile of these medium-term tenants: young, high-paid, driven, and fit. To illustrate his point, he cajoled Funchal\u2019s community manager into performing burpees. Ponta do Sol currently has the highest density of Alojamento Local homes on the island, tripling in recent years, and the intense demand from remote workers is driving residents to either reallocate existing rental and tourism properties to this market, or build more.Even on a casual tour through town, I saw construction everywhere. On a steep road that\u2019s been nicknamed Nomad Street by foreigners, a build site advertises its final form on a placard: Platinum Villas VIII, all glass and sharp angles. High in the hills, I paused to chat with a local man working a sloped patch of garden. He put down the banana plant he\u2019d been carrying on his shoulder and told me he\u2019d just come from his day job in construction. He worked on a property owned by a wealthy American who\u2019d ordered the fruit plantation next to his house razed to make space for new rental apartments. The man had rescued as many trees as he could, to replant on his own plot.\nMadeiran residents now pay among the highest percentage of their salary on rent in Portugal. \nLocal government representatives assured me that the itinerant young workers attracted by the Digital Nomad Village were valuable and welcome additions to the region. But when I talked to João Campanário, Ponta do Sol\u2019s parish council president, he told me he had never actually met one. Not even Hall had stopped by to introduce himself before installing a coworking space across the street from his office. Still, he said, \u201Cwe\u2019d like them to stay here.\u201D\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERS\nCélia Pessegueiro, the head of Ponta do Sol\u2019s municipal council, described the arrival of digital nomads during the pandemic as \u201Ca kind of ray of sunshine in the middle of a cloudy day.\u201D After the streets had been so quiet for months, there was a certain joy in spotting young people in backpacks and sandals wandering, dazed, through the tiny village.\nHall praised the regional president, Albuquerque, as a politician who \u201Cthinks like a CEO\u201D\u2014where others see an empty building, he sees opportunity for investment. Hall described his relationship with Pessegueiro as friendly but confided that he was disappointed by the lack of similar thinking on her part. Though he had hardly engaged the municipal and parish governments at any level of planning, he felt he was not being supported. (For instance, he had asked Pessegueiro to install workout equipment by the beach. \u201CThere\u2019s no room,\u201D she explained, seeming surprised.)When I brought this up with Pessegueiro, she paused and chose her words carefully. \u201CThis place is ready to receive visitors and new residents,\u201D she said. \u201CI want them to feel like they\u2019re coming to a place where there are people living already, and to live well with them. I don\u2019t want the people who are from here to feel excluded in any way.\u201D\nHousing is one area where exclusion has been most sharply felt. The price of homes in Ponta do Sol has jumped 30 percent in the past year, and the rental stock in Madeira has dropped by 42 percent in approximately the same period. Nearly two-thirds of the apartments on offer were priced over \u20AC1,000\u2014in a region where the monthly minimum wage is \u20AC723. In Funchal, rents are even higher: The small city is second only to Lisbon in lack of affordability. Madeiran residents now pay among the highest percentage of their salary on rent in the country. \nMadeira also has the highest density of social housing in Portugal, double the national average. Five thousand families are on the waiting list for housing support, and the regional government\u2019s response has been to announce the construction of housing units that are even more affordable. Edgar Silva, an opposition politician in Funchal, has publicly lamented how the city\u2019s working-class heart is being gutted. In a local news outlet, he blasted what he called \u201Ca perverse mechanism of social segregation,\u201D as unfettered price increases push more and more locals to the periphery.\nPessegueiro had visited Lisbon recently and observed how its most iconic neighborhoods had been emptied of their residents\u2014drained of the living memory of the capital\u2019s historic center. To protect the character of her own town, she outlined community-rooted solutions: supporting families with renovations of old properties, the recuperation of abandoned houses, building homes on inherited land. \u201CThe question of housing support is fundamental to keep people here, so that they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being forced out of their homes,\u201D she told me. \u201CThat\u2019s the balance.\u201D\nLISBON IS A case study for how a sweeping invitation to the world\u2014at least, to the parts of the world with money and relaxed visa agreements\u2014can look like a rousing success and a catastrophe at the same time, depending on what you measure. Following a devastating economic meltdown in 2008 that left 40 percent of millennials unemployed, Portugal\u2019s government introduced two measures to attract foreign investment: the Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) tax scheme in 2009, and the Golden Visa program in 2012. Portuguese people earn among the lowest salaries in Europe, work some of the longest hours, and pay some of the highest income taxes. A local who earns the average monthly wage of \u20AC1,500 loses nearly a third of it to tax, with the sliding scale topping out at 48 percent for annual salaries above \u20AC75,000. By contrast, a foreign resident who qualifies for the NHR scheme pays a flat tax of 20 percent for 10 years. The Golden Visa program, meanwhile, had been billed as a pathway to job creation, fast-tracking citizenship in exchange for an investment of at least \u20AC250,000. An audit last year found that more than 90 percent of all visas issued in the past nine years were for a real estate purchase. \nIn the past year, Lisbon has earned the dubious distinction of being ranked the third most financially unliveable city in the world.\nThis year the investment requirement was increased, and a restriction imposed on Golden Visa residential real estate purchases in Lisbon, Porto, and Portugal\u2019s coastal region. There are no such restrictions in Madeira, however, which is autonomously governed. Madeira also has its own tax scheme to attract foreign investment, in particular a highly competitive 5 percent corporate rate. Multiple investigations by the European Commission found Madeira\u2019s tax cuts were violating EU rules to illegally benefit companies, with no clear contribution to Madeirans, who experience the highest unemployment rate in the country. Many of the jobs these companies had claimed to create on the island were based either outside the region or outside the EU altogether, or even fabricated.\nPortugal has also sought to draw foreign spending via an aggressive tourism campaign. In 2022, the country brought in more money from tourism than in any year prior. This summer, the capital\u2019s iconic electric tram 28 became utterly unusable as public transportation, due to the long lines of tourists eager for an Instagrammable ride. And while the government credits tourism for helping to reduce unemployment, the reality is that the bulk of those new service-oriented jobs are painfully precarious.The tourism boom and rampant real estate speculation has precipitated an ongoing evictions crisis in the capital, where renters receive patchwork legal protections. After a wave of evictions between 2014 and 2016, in which more than five households were evicted per day, the National Rental Desk reported in 2022 that evictions are on the rise once more, up 36 percent over the past year. Some activist groups say the number of illegal evictions carried out\u2014including well-documented intimidation campaigns by owners against elderly tenants and the razing of informal housing\u2014makes the scope of the crisis much larger. In the parish of Santa Maria Maior, where the historic neighborhoods of Alfama and Mouraria are located, 61 percent of homes are now registered as AL properties\u2014meaning the majority of what were once family homes have been emptied of their residents. Earlier this year, the Lisbon city council put a freeze on new AL licenses, and in an extraordinary ruling, the country\u2019s Supreme Court voted to restrict short- and medium-term rentals in residential buildings. Still, real estate speculation continues to wreak tremendous damage. In the past year, Lisbon has earned the dubious distinction of being ranked the third most financially unliveable city in the world, just behind London and just above Mexico City, another beleaguered digital nomad hot spot. \n\u201CFriends tell me, \u2018Lisbon suffered a perfect storm,\u2019\u201D Antonio Gori, a member of the housing rights collective Habita, told me. \u201CBut it wasn\u2019t a storm. It\u2019s the fruit of political decisions.\u201D\nFor the past seven years, Ana Mendes Godinho, formerly the country\u2019s secretary of state for tourism and now its minister of labor, solidarity, and social security, has set her sights on drawing temporary and long-stay foreign remote workers to Portugal. The relocation of Web Summit, a massive annual technology conference, to Lisbon in 2016 \u201Cwas a very important turning point,\u201D Godinho told me. She inaugurated dozens of coworking spaces in the interior of the country and expanded a financial incentive program to encourage relocation to the region\u2014initially open only to citizens\u2014to remote workers of any nationality. At last year\u2019s Web Summit, she promised to personally reply to emails from remote workers who were interested, and in the weeks leading up to the 2022 summit, her government announced a new visa, widely referred to as a Digital Nomad Visa. (The visa is renewable for five years, the same amount of time necessary to become eligible for citizenship.) \u201CWe feel that this is the perfect moment, and we have the perfect conditions for digital nomads to choose Portugal for their lives,\u201D Godinho told me.\nA common narrative employed by the champions of foreign remote workers is that Portugal needs people. Advocates cite underpopulated rural communities and point to the brain drain precipitated by the economic crisis, when millennials, the highest-educated generation in Portuguese history, left the country in droves. In both instances, most people left in search of employment; remote work, they argue, could solve all of that. Hall described his repopulation plan as a \u201Cfunnel\u201D: First draw the digital nomads, then entice the ones who will buy houses and settle. Pieter Levels, the proprietor of The Nomad List, one of the first sites dedicated to nomad hubs, recently launched a residency-consulting business for remote workers in Portugal. His sales pitch painted a portrait of a country \u201Cin dire need of foreigners to live, work, and spend money there to recover\u201D and then went on to list the various ways you wouldn\u2019t spend money there: 0 percent tax on income, 0 percent on crypto, 0 percent on dividends, 0 percent on wealth. StartUp Madeira has claimed that itinerant remote workers, as a whole, inject \u20AC1.5 million each month into the region. Immigrants, meanwhile, contributed \u20AC1.3 billion to the country\u2019s social security fund last year. Yet so many of these foreign-born workers\u2014particularly those from Brazil, Cape Verde, Angola, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Venezuela\u2014are not received with the same fanfare. From discrimination and racist treatment to allegations of torture by the national guard, human trafficking, and outright slavery in the agricultural fields of the Alentejo, the distinctions between who is welcome and who isn\u2019t couldn\u2019t be starker. Just as Uber and Airbnb bypassed regulations by branding themselves as innovators of a \u201Csharing economy,\u201D the private and public hype around \u201Cdigital nomads\u201D makes an easy cover for propping up a hierarchy of migration.\nNearly every Madeiran I spoke with had something to say about their region\u2019s sudden rise in popularity among remote work visitors and settlers. But Madeira is small. The uneasy memory of Portugal\u2019s long dictatorship still lingers here; plus, everyone seemed to know someone who worked for the government or in tourism. Most asked that I keep their comments, even innocuous ones, off the record, or protect their identity: the teachers on their smoke break who balked at the nearly \u20AC1,700 rent foreigners were willing to pay at a new digital nomad hotel; the farmer who pointed out various foreign-owned rental properties on a nearby hill; the young doctor who loved the energy of the newcomers but lamented that it was all happening too fast; the woman in Funchal who laughed over how they had flooded Tinder, earning them the nickname \u201Cgenital nomads.\u201D \n\u201CPeople say outright that they only want to rent to digital nomads,\u201D one resident of a small town near Ponta do Sol complained. \u201CIt\u2019s maybe the worst thing about this project.\u201D Another described an American friend who had fled California because of the annual wildfires and was renting a rustic apartment in the hills above Ponta do Sol for \u20AC800\u2014two or three times higher than it would have cost a few years ago, by her estimation. \u201CMany of them are running away from something\u2014from climate change, from real estate speculation, from Brexit,\u201D she said. While her island was a refuge for them, she bemoaned that young Madeirans had nowhere left to flee\u2014not Venezuela, not the UK, and certainly not the mainland.\nBeverly Yuen Thompson, a sociologist, describes these wandering remote workers as \u201Ccanaries in the digital coal mine.\u201D Despite the branded imagery of freedom, leisure, and good-vibes-only positivity\u2014discussion of anything political, for example, was not allowed on the Madeira Slack channel\u2014Thompson writes that the lifestyle is undergirded by uncertainty, inequality, and abandonment by both governments and workplaces. Digital nomads have \u201Cstrong passports and resources,\u201D she points out, \u201Cjust not enough to live as comfortably in their own land as in someone else\u2019s.\u201D\nPHOTOGRAPH: KYLE JEFFERSFor a sector that so loudly proclaims its devotion to quality of life, the failure of the global leaders in the digital nomad space to consider the losses of host communities is astounding to behold. It is as though those living communities don\u2019t matter beyond the abstract role they fulfill as backdrop. Lumber, not trees. In April, a video circulated on social media of 50 police officers with their batons out in the streets of Beato, a rapidly gentrifying parish in eastern Lisbon, grabbing and striking a group of women and children who were protesting a mass eviction. A few weeks later, the massive Creative Hub of Beato on the waterfront, home to Lisbon\u2019s newest \u201Cunicorn factory,\u201D hosted a hackathon to find innovative solutions to the capital\u2019s housing crisis. The winning answer: blockchain.\nWhen I spoke to some of the local architects of Portugal\u2019s digital nomad boom\u2014Hall, StartUp Madeira CEO Carlos Soares Lopes, minister Godinho, and tourism authority president Luís Araújo\u2014earlier this year, they were either reluctant to acknowledge its impact on long-term residents, dismissed housing as a separate issue, or pointed to coliving as the solution. As harms have compounded, however, public criticism has become impossible to ignore. This fall, the Portuguese press documented a distressing shortage of student housing, with report after report of undergraduates dropping out or sleeping in pantries because 80 percent of the rooms that had long been available to them were rented out. In November, Portugal\u2019s secretary of state for tourism at the time, Rita Marques, admitted that \u201Cwe have been the victims of our own success, and that\u2019s true for digital nomads and for tourism too.\u201D\n\u201CI like to say that 500 years ago, Portugal discovered the world by sea,\u201D Godinho said, \u201Cso now we are being discovered in this digital world.\u201D\nHall now concedes there is some \u201Cshort-term pain\u201D for locals but insists that the payoff will be worth it. Not long after the launch in Madeira, he began pitching the Digital Nomad Village model to governments elsewhere in Portugal, then in Cape Verde, and most recently in Brazil. He purchased the NomadX brand from Williams to act as an umbrella for his rapidly expanding roster of projects, and this summer he launched a nonprofit with his wife and their friends: the Digital Nomads Association Portugal. They promptly elected him president. He believes he can \u201Cfix\u201D what\u2019s wrong with each of these places using his model; maybe 10 years to fix Cape Verde, possibly a little longer to figure out Brazil.\nIN PONTA DO Sol, Melissa Cabral did return to the Digital Nomad Village. Some weeks after the group lunch, she got a call from StartUp Madeira, offering her a temporary part-time contract as community manager. She became the first Madeirense in charge of helping orient new arrivals, organizing events, and facilitating day-to-day functioning in Ponta do Sol. When she started in July, of all the people who\u2019d enthusiastically received her at lunch five months earlier, only one remained. \nSign Up Today\nSign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.\nCabral reached out to her own local friends and contacts on the island, inviting them to events and to use the free coworking space, but soon found that many of them simply weren\u2019t interested. Even her brother refused her offers of a ride to the coworking space, where she happily sets up shop each day\u2014he preferred working from home. Perhaps, she mused, it was the fact that \u201Cthe digital nomads were not really at home\u201D that made the coworking space and constant events appealing to them. While she has felt energized working closely with the international visitors in Ponta do Sol these past few months, her perspective on bringing more locals into the Digital Nomad Village fold has changed. \u201CThey have different lifestyles,\u201D she told me.\nI recalled a story Pessegueiro had shared with me about a public garden in the village. At first, plants were purchased from a greenhouse, but these quickly withered because they weren\u2019t acclimated to the local conditions. But then, she told me, \u201Cpeople started giving us plants from their gardens.\u201D This time, the garden flourished. Like the town, Pessegueiro emphasized, it could not be prepared and made beautiful only for the eyes and photographs of tourists.I spent my last afternoon in Ponta do Sol on a Slack-organized hike along the Levada do Moinho, one of the oldest irrigation canals in the area. We climbed Nomad Street, past a colorful parade of brightly painted houses fringed by lush flower gardens, and paused briefly at the top of the hill in the shadow of a large pink building, the Esmeraldo house. In the 1400s, Flemish sugar baron João Esmeraldo presided over a vast, profitable sugarcane plantation from up here.\nPortuguese politicians often draw parallels between the country\u2019s current popularity and its past glories. Disappointingly, the version of history they present is divorced from its brutal reality, emptied of any lessons it could possibly impart. \u201CJust as it was in the 15th century,\u201D Rui Miguel Barreto, Madeira\u2019s secretary of economy, said in a speech earlier this year, \u201CMadeira can become a gateway, a platform for development, for business on a global scale.\u201D When we spoke on Zoom, Godinho called it \u201Canother time of discovery,\u201D without a trace of irony. \u201CI like to say that 500 years ago, Portugal discovered the world by sea,\u201D she continued, \u201Cso now we are being discovered in this digital world.\u201D\nThe island colony of Madeira experienced the world\u2019s most spectacular cash crop boom in the 15th century, followed by an epic crash a few decades later as its sugar economy collapsed alongside the deforestation that fueled such rapacious expansion. This capitalist pilot project, environmental historian Jason W. Moore has noted, was cosmopolitan from the start. Settlers from mainland Portugal hauled timber and planted cane while enslaved people trafficked from the Canary Islands and the African coast took on the dangerous work of building mountainside irrigation canals, and bankers and traders from Flanders and Genoa circulated the product and profits. This included João Esmeraldo\u2019s dear friend Christopher Columbus, who pivoted from the sugar business to maritime exploration during his time in the archipelago.\nMadeira was an early testing ground for the slavery-based island plantation economy, a place named by some scholars as the birthplace of global racial capitalism. But on my visit, I did not see any outward trace of this explosive role in history. Even in Funchal, at the sugar museum that doubles as a monument to Columbus, I did not find a single use of the words \u201Censlaved,\u201D \u201Cslave,\u201D \u201Cslavery,\u201D or \u201Cexploitation.\u201D A few minutes away, in the harbor, a replica of Columbus\u2019 ship the Santa Maria takes visitors on twice-daily tours along the southern coast. For \u20AC35, the tour company promises, you too can feel exactly how this great discoverer felt, exploring new corners of the world.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Photography, for instance, has served as a powerful tool to help us do this. I\u2019ve explored this with my 2020 project ALIVE: Lost for Words, where I photographed people against a projected image of their lost loved ones. \nRecently, the pandemic left us feeling closer than ever to death, forcing us to confront our own mortality and the legacy we leave behind. With our normal lives disrupted by social distancing, digital tools also radically impacted our traditional death rituals. We said final goodbyes over FaceTime, mourned together via Zoom, lit virtual prayer candles from our laptops. \nREAD MORE\nThis story is from the WIRED World in 2023, our annual trends briefing. Read more stories from the series here\u2014or download or order a copy of the magazine.\nIn 2023, technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain will allow us to create new forms of posthumous digital presences. The adoption of these technologies is already opening our minds to the idea of living forever in the virtual world. For instance, in 2020, hologram experts Kaleida collaborated with Kanye West to create a hologram of Kim Kardashian\u2019s late father for her 40th birthday. Genealogy platform MyHeritage has created Deep Nostalgia, a deep-fake tool that animates the faces of departed relatives in family photos. Stonses, a blockchain-powered memorial platform, can store digital NFT replicas of our treasured possessions, affording a permanence to the memories we associate with them.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nChess Pro Answers Questions From Twitter\nIn 2023, the increased adoption of Web3 technologies will take this concept to the next level. Immersive virtual reality combined with multisensory stimulation will also allow us to interact with the image of our lost loved ones in an emotionally visceral way. We\u2019ve already seen such technology used in the entertainment industry, with premium cinema startup Positron creating a range of Voyager VR chairs that amplify cinematic experiences with haptic pillows and scent dispensers. Reimagined for memorial purposes, this tech will allow us to not just see the image of the deceased, but also smell their signature perfume and physically feel their presence on our skin.\nIn 2023, technology will also be used to not only preserve our conversations with those who have passed on, but also replicate them. This will be possible with tools such as the hyperrealistic online chatbot Project December, which uses AI to emulate the style of whatever text is fed to it. Through learning from the remnants of their digital trails\u2014text messages, blog posts, 3 am tweets\u2014AI will let us talk with a chatbot that mimics someone no longer with us.\nAs these technologies develop and become more accessible, they will increasingly be used in combination, creating \u201Cintelligent avatars\u201D of ourselves that continue to \u201Clive\u201D long after we have died. We are seeing the beginnings of this with the metaverse company Somnium Space, whose Live Forever mode allows users to create \u201Cdigital clones\u201D built from data they have stored while alive, including conversational style, gaits, and even facial expressions. \nThis sense of immortality may be reassuring, but there is a catch. AI avatars will rely on us feeding their algorithms a huge amount of personal data, accumulated through the course of our lives. If we want our digital selves to live on, this is the exchange we must accept: that the unfiltered beliefs and opinions we express today may not only be archived, but consequently used to build these posthumous personae. In other words, we can have a voice in the afterlife, but we cannot be certain about what it may say. This will force us to reconsider how our behaviors today might influence digital versions of ourselves set to outlive us. Faced with this prospect of virtual immortality, 2023 will be the year we broaden our definition of what it means to live forever, a moral question that will fundamentally change how we live our day-to-day lives, but also what it means to be immortal.","post_cover":null,"author":"BY RANKIN","title":"Digital Eternity Is Just Around the Corner","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/death-technology-memory\/","tags":["","VIRTUAL REALITY","AUGMENTED REALITY","THE WIRED WORLD IN 2023","ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","DEATH","MEMORY"]},{"date":"12.15.2022","summary":"This week on Gadget Lab, we talk about the development of the Ledger Stax, a cryptocurrency wallet designed by Tony Fadell.","post_content":"EVEN IF YOU own no bitcoin, no ether, and no NFTs, crypto wallets\u2014pocket-friendly hardware lockers that store digital assets\u2014will be a part of your future.

I've heard of crypto wallets, because I've heard about the extreme measures people have to go to to hack into them.\nMichael Calore: Well, we're going to learn more about them right now.\nLauren Goode: I'm excited.\nMichael Calore: Hi everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I am Michael Calore. I'm a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We're also joined this week, once again, by WIRED editor at large Steven Levy. Steven, welcome back to the show.\nSteven Levy: Thank you. It was always a thrill to be on the show.\nLauren Goode: Steven, we have to tell you that as we were reading your latest feature and preparing for this show, Mike and I looked at each other and said, \u201CSteven's a really good writer.\u201D We knew that already, of course. But it was underscored. You really are. It's like you've been doing it for a while. A fantastic writer.\nSteven Levy: I think I have a pretty good lead on everyone else for the most features in WIRED magazine.\nLauren Goode: Incredible.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and I don't think I'm going to challenge you on that.\nLauren Goode: No, we're never going to catch up.\nMichael Calore: Well, Steven, your latest feature for WIRED is a story about cryptocurrency. Most of our listeners probably know at this point that we are in the midst of a crypto winter where the values of many digital currencies have fallen. Exchanges are under intense scrutiny. The NFT market has crashed, and the whole scene is going through a lot of difficult times. So this particular moment feels like the right time to step back and take a long-term look at the crypto world and think about where it might be going in the next few years. Now, one company thinking far into the future is Ledger. Steven just wrote a big story for WIRED about this company, a French business that sells cryptocurrency wallets. Ledger's newest wallet is called Stax. It's making waves primarily because it's designed by Tony Fadell, the guy behind the iPod and the iPhone and the Nest thermostat. Tony's a big deal. If Tony Fadell is making Ledger's next crypto wallet, then it'll get the attention of more than just the crypto bros. But let's start with some basics. Steven, can you please tell us what is a cryptocurrency wallet?Steven Levy: Right, OK. So the wallet we're talking about is something that holds not only cryptocurrency but other kinds of digital assets, which could range from NFTs to papers about your identity. Think of it as a tiny secure vault that holds your private key, which is sort of a stamp you make to authenticate that you are you. So when you have a crypto asset, whether it's a bitcoin or an NFT, it lives on this ledger called the blockchain. And your direct connection is that the owner of the digital asset is logged on this ledger. So the question is, how do you prove that it's you? How do you prove that you're the owner? And that's because there's a little key, which when you unlock it, it says, bam, it's you. And you have to hold this key in the tightest, most secure place, because anyone who has the key is automatically the owner. It's definitional: The person who has the key owns that asset. So the crypto wallet is a way where that power is literally in your hands, where you have this piece of hardware which holds that digital key very, very closely. And if it hasn't been hacked, so as you mentioned, that's very important. You can prove that those assets are yours.\nLauren Goode: How does this differ from using something like secure ID on an iPhone? Apple often talks about how secure it is to use something like face unlock and store your biometric info on their secure ID. Because that is something that the company does not have access to, and you're sort of holding that in your hand. How is this different?\nSteven Levy: Well, one thing I learned about studying crypto, and I actually wrote a book about it at one point, is that the amount of effort you put into protecting something pretty much has to be in sync with how important it is to protect it. So if it's very, very, very important, you need the most secure way to lock something down. And as it turns out, the phone is not the most secure way. There's companies that sell to other governments a way to hack it outright. And the biometrics like face recognition and fingerprints you use can be relatively easy to hack. They're public, people can see your face, they can fake it, they can get your fingerprint, they can cut your finger off. I just watched the movie about that, where some guy cut his finger off.\nLauren Goode: Let's put a pin in that and come back to it.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, it's not the most secure way to do things. So this company has put its bet on people saying, \u201CHey, if I'm going to have these digital assets that are so secure, I don't have to trust anyone in the world, any kind of institution or bank or anyone else, I want maximum security.\u201D And that can only come from something which is an unhackable way to protect your key.Michael Calore: So this company that you wrote about, Ledger, they make these cryptocurrency wallets. That's their primary business. Tell us more about Ledger.\nSteven Levy: So Ledger is a French company, which in 2014 began making these wallets. So not the only company that makes them, but they become the leader of the field. And right now they look like an old USB stick, the kind that had a jackknife sort of scheme where you put a metal sheath over it and flipped it open. And right now the passcode you use is in this tiny little microscopic display they have, and it isn't even a keypad. It's hard to use, but it's very, very secure. And I think something like 20 percent of the world's cryptocurrency is protected by Ledger wallets and maybe 30 percent of NFTs. So they're definitely one of the leading companies in the field. But still, it's pretty hard to use, it's something really reserved for the hardcore crypto crowd. So my story begins when the people at Ledger thought, \u201CGee, how can we open this up and appeal to an audience beyond the geeks, beyond the crypto bros, and make it so a wider swath of the population can adopt this technology?\u201D\nLauren Goode: So enter Tony Fadell. To be clear, he didn't found Ledger, but he got involved a little bit later because something was really irking him about the products. He was consulting, and then he ended up saying, \u201CLet's redesign the whole thing.\u201D Talk about that.\nSteven Levy: Even before Tony, there was another person named Ian Rogers who came to the company, and this guy's a fascinating guy. I mentioned that he had a lot of trophy jobs, but trophies they usually don't find in the same case. He was kind of a skateboard kid who took computer science and worked at Yahoo and headed Yahoo Music. And then he went to work for Beats and did their music software and then started Apple Music when Apple bought Beats. And then he became the head of these luxury fashion brands. And the CEO of Ledger, this guy named Pascal Gauthier, thought, \u201CI need Americans to market my product, because the French are too stodgy and I want to be a global company.\u201D So he tapped this guy Ian to come and work for him, but Ian had a friend in Paris who he said, \u201CCan you look into this for me?\u201D And that friend was Tony Fadell. And Tony, in doing due diligence, got excited about the prospect of rethinking the crypto wallet and agreed to do the redesign for a wallet. He didn't join the company; he got a little piece of the company, but he became the defacto design head and father of this new product called Stax.\nLauren Goode: And you mentioned earlier that some of the previous crypto wallets from Ledger, they had a tiny screen, they weren't super easy to unlock, and in your story you mentioned that the directions say, allow yourself 30 minutes to even set this thing up. And then in comes Mr. iPod, who reinvented the literal wheel. So what was his vision for this new wallet?Steven Levy: So he looked at this and he thought, \u201CGee, this is just like digital music was when I was charged to lead the iPod project from Steve Jobs.\u201D The first MP3 players were really clunky to use; it was hard to even pick out the single song you wanted to listen to. They were bulky, and they were definitely not cool and fun. So he said, \u201CI could do the same thing for wallets. Instead of having this tiny little display and no buttons, I could do a touchscreen. And what's more, I can make the touchscreen really cool in a credit-card-size device. Where this screen, and it's an E Ink screen, wraps around the side, and on the side you could read it like the spine of a book. And maybe you'll have a bunch of different assets in different categories that you could use together, and you could stack them up like a big pile of a hundred dollars bills.\u201D So they made them magnetic so they would snap in order. And you could put your NFTs on the display. They had a long battery life so you could put it in a drawer and it would be good for months. So he decided to make this thing easier to use and cooler, and sell it for a reasonable price and make it a more welcoming product for people considering getting into self custody for digital assets.\nMichael Calore: I think both Ian Rogers and Tony Fadell told you at some point in your reporting, and this is in the story, that they believed that what we're looking at right now is a moment that goes back to about 15 years ago. When most people believed that when the iPhone came out, that it wouldn't necessarily be a product for everybody. Not everybody is going to want a smartphone. That was obviously wrong. And Ian Rogers says that something similar is happening right now with cryptocurrency, where it doesn't really feel super vital to daily life for everyone at the moment. But that in the future, most humans will end up owning digital assets. I wonder if that's really true.\nSteven Levy: I think the long-term vision is valid. Ian said something really interesting to me. He said he attended a conference in New York recently, and it was a bunch of crypto people and you needed a crypto token to actually get in. It was your ticket. And he thought how weird it was that the technology he used to get into this party basically was more secure, more sophisticated, and easier to use than what you used to get into a country. I think eventually you can make the case that our passports will be digital assets and our driver's licenses and our Taylor Swift tickets. It'll be a long process. But I think it makes sense that somewhere down the line, I don't want to put how many years it's going to take, that this is going to be the way that we hold everything dear to us that can be digitized.Lauren Goode: As I was reading this story, that's exactly what I was thinking. I was wondering if it was eventually going to become more than just a crypto wallet. If it was going to store our passports and licenses and vaccine cards. Because as someone who loses things quite a bit, I was thinking, \u201COK, this thing is $249. I would probably spend that amount on a really secure digital wallet if it meant I wasn't replacing all the other things I lose throughout the year.\u201D\nMichael Calore: And just don't lose your wallet.\nSteven Levy: But definitely, I think that's it. Now, they don't have a clear roadmap on how to make this happen in two years. And Ian actually said to me, \u201CI'm a little wary that we're going to be like the Nokia or Blackberry of this space.\u201D Because they're there now, and maybe down the road someone will come up. But right now their hope is to build this big head start, and since they're already the most popular product in this pre-cool-device era of wallets, yhey're hoping they can just put the stake in the ground, and as this happens, they will be the platform that people use for these other digital assets.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, let's take a quick break and we'll be right back.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right, welcome back. Now obviously, when Ledger first started planning the Stax release and got Fadell involved to build it, the crypto world was doing OK, and then a lot of cryptocurrencies tumbled in value. The NFT market crashed, and now the FTX Exchange is the target of a fraud investigation. And the whole crypto world seems to be in a pretty serious crisis. Some people might point to all of the recent news and say, \u201CWow, lousy timing for Ledger to release this wallet.\u201D But others like Fadell and his team would say, \u201CNo, this is actually perfect timing.\u201D\nSteven Levy: That's right. It is been a challenging year for crypto in general, but not disastrous. At the time, I went to Paris and had to suffer my way through the City of Lights while reporting the story. A couple weeks later, the team came to New York, and during that period we learned about FTX and SBF, and the whole crypto market just collapsed and was shrouded in doubt and fear and loathing. So when I brought this up to them, they said, \u201CWell, we're the solution.\u201D And they noted to me, and we had discussed this before, then when your money is in a crypto exchange like FTX, it's the same principle as a bank. If you have money in a bank, they don't earmark your dollars with your name on it in a red marker. They just put it in a big pile. And if everyone wants it all at once, they have to have enough money to pay people back. If they don't, it's a big trouble. As Samuel Bankman-Fried learned, and we all learned from FTX, with self custody, it doesn't work that way. The money is actually earmarked for you and linked to your little private key. So that could not happen if your money was protected by self-custody and a crypto wallet. The question is how successful the whole market is going to be. Whether this casts a big enough shadow on the whole crypto market that people are going to ignore it. I said, \u201CIs this going to be introducing a great cocktail on the Titanic just before it hits the iceberg?\u201DLauren Goode: So wait a second. If someone had, let's say, made an investment that was tied to Sam Bankman-Fried's coin FTT, or let's say they invested directly in the FTT coin, and it was stored on a ledger wallet. Then if the value of that coin goes down significantly, how does having it on a ledger wallet, a hard wallet make it any different than just having it stored in an exchange or having a record of it on an exchange?\nSteven Levy: Well, if the currency itself is worthless, you're right. But if you are trying to get your assets, a lot of people had their money not in the magic beans that SPF invented, but in bitcoin and ether and other markers of value that still have some value. If they have their money in there, and they couldn't get it out, they couldn't get it paid back. So if money is involved in a currency which is worth something, you could recover it. In this case, there was real money that disappeared. They said, \u201COh, there's a line in the spreadsheet for 8 billion that we forgot about.\u201D Kind of like, \u201CThere's one little line, and if you want your money back, sorry, we can't deliver that because this line in the spreadsheet disappeared.\u201D And if you buy an NFT, at the least you want to say that my ownership in this NFT is verified. And I don't have to trust anyone else to be able to claim what I purchased.\nLauren Goode: I think I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the idea of a hard wallet and what it points to if you were to use an analog to a current banking app. When I use authentication on my iPhone to get into my current banking app, I don't believe that what I'm looking at is the actual repository of dollars. I'm looking at a digital representation of dollars that are stored somewhere else. With the hard wallet, it's another form of identity verification, and it's holding the keys that point to assets that are somewhere else.\nSteven Levy: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Am I understanding that? It's not like you're looking at the NFT itself on this little wallet.\nSteven Levy: The difference is that with your bank, there's a third party involved that you have to trust. If your bank goes bust, you might have had a thousand dollars in that bank, but you're not getting that thousand dollars. This is more like saying, \u201CI have a thousand dollars in a safety deposit in this bank, the bank went broke, but I still have access to the safe deposit box.\u201D\nMichael Calore: That's a good analogy. I think the idea of a cryptocurrency wallet saves us from some of the abstraction that's involved when thinking about exchanges. Because it's a physical token that you hold in your hand that you can manipulate via the touchscreen if you have a Stax. And it's not something that sort of exists in the sky that you access through a browser. So I do think that eliminating that abstraction of dealing with exchanges is helpful for the cryptocurrency market. Because it gives something that people who are less familiar with it or who still find it confusing and weirdly obfuscated, it gives them something to literally hold on to, literally and figuratively hold on to. And I know that that was Fadell and Roger's goal in building this wallet, making something that was even more accessible to get people into wallets. And I think maybe the real hump they have to get over is not giving people something that they can use to help them understand cryptocurrency. But giving them something that they can use to help them understand the difference between a physical wallet and an exchange.Steven Levy: And the idea is, and I didn't really realize this until I did the story, is that the word trust is a pejorative in this world. The idea that you have to trust someone is anathema to the true crypto people. They don't want trustworthy places to deal with, because that implies that you have to extend trust. They want trust-proof systems where you don't have to rely on anyone, no matter how trustworthy they look. So again, it muddies the conversation to limit it to talk about cryptocurrencies, because as Lauren pointed out, cryptocurrencies might go bust. It's more to say digital assets, digital identity markers that are going to be protected in your digital vault. Because these things are emblazoned on the ledger that there's many copies of, and you can't forge it. And then you have the direct connection with your private key and that you don't really do other kinds of manipulation with this wallet. It's almost like in medieval times, they had a seal, and you had your own personal seal that you would stamp it with to verify it's you. This is a much more secure, high-tech version of that. You don't need to trust anyone. I mentioned Taylor Swift tickets\u2014they're super, super valuable. If you want a non-forgeable Taylor Swift ticket, this would be the way to do it. You wouldn't have to trust a scalper, you wouldn't have to trust Ticketmaster. That would be your proof that you're the owner of a general admission ticket to see Taylor Swift.\nLauren Goode: Steven, before we go, I have to ask you, have you purchased a Ledger Stax wallet, and are you investing in crypto?\nSteven Levy: Well, I don't have the new one yet. They did send me the current version to test out, and I managed to get it going. But I actually came down with Covid before I actually wanted to confer with their people, before I moved my wealth of crypto assets over to it. I wrote about this, I do own some crypto because in 2014 I went to a demo of a bitcoin ATM and put $20 in and at one point it got to be a lot of money. But now it's still worth over a thousand dollars.\nLauren Goode: Nice.\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nSteven Levy: Which I thought was ironic, because all these investors were going to this Y Combinator Demo Day figuring out which company would be a return on their investment. And they just should have funneled a lot of money into that ATM machine, they would've done better.\nLauren Goode: But what I'm hearing you say is that, and by the way, we're sorry that you were dealing with Covid, and we're glad that you're better and back on the show. But it sounds like you are waiting for something to move those crypto assets onto this new wallet. Does that mean you don't fully trust it?Steven Levy: I don't trust myself to do it correctly. And this is the one scary part about wallets, is ultimately the responsibility is yours. If someone gets your passcode and the passcode for these wallets \u2026 the way the private key is generated, I think like 26 different words that you have to write down. And if you lose that, and if someone else comes across it, they can basically claim your assets. So it's up to you to protect your password for that private key. And if you screw up, it's gone.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Well don't screw up.\nSteven Levy: Yeah. Well, yeah. I don't want to lose my fortune in bitcoin.\nMichael Calore: All right, let's take another break, and when we come back we'll do recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: OK. Steven Levy, you are our guest. So please tell us, what do you recommend to our listeners that they check out.\nSteven Levy: Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: Paxlovid?\nSteven Levy: Yes. It's this medicine, this drug that is an option to take, and you get it free, the government pays for it actually. If you've come down with Covid and you do it in the first five days of symptoms, it can lessen the symptoms by maybe a couple days. And cut the odds if you've been vaccinated, they're already pretty low, but further cut them, that serious bad things will happen. The drawback is that it tastes very bad. And in my newsletter I did some tasting notes and I said, \u201CThere's a bouquet of a porta potty and an underfunded jam band concert.\u201D And other kinds of things. To me, because I had some very uncomfortable flu-like symptoms to cut a couple days out of, that was worth it. So I recommend Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: That's great. And I know that if you have symptoms and you're worried that you might have Covid, and you go to get tested at a facility like a hospital or a public testing site or the local library or your doctor's office, they will ask you if you are you interested in receiving Paxlovid. And they'll give it to you if you do test positive.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, it's very easy to get. Originally when they first came out, it was tough to get. Now it's super easy. Basically, my doctor, who I had a telemedicine appointment with, went over with it, and actually he was sort of on the fence. Because some people reported you get a bounce back, so you have to sort of crunch some numbers. Supposedly it lessens the odds you'll get long Covid. But I weighed all the factors and decided to get it. And my pharmacy delivered it within an hour from there. So I took the five days of Paxlovid.\nMichael Calore: And you can taste things again now.\nSteven Levy: Yeah, yeah. I never lost my sense of taste, but I was hyper aware of the taste of Paxlovid.Lauren Goode: Once again, Steven, we're very glad that you have recovered.\nSteven Levy: Well, thank you.\nMichael Calore: Indeed. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is going to seem rather nonessential compared to Steven's. But if you happen to be, oh, I don't know, staying home with Covid and you're looking for something to watch, I recommend White Lotus season two. I recommended this earlier this year when I first started watching it. Now the season has wrapped up. It's an incredible series; check it out. Don't go on Instagram if you don't want it spoiled for you. If you don't want to know who dies. I recommend staying away from Evan Ross Katz's profile in particular, because he screenshots a lot of memes from the show. He's hilarious. But yeah, White Lotus season two, just to follow up on that one. And then my actual recommendation this week is related to our podcast producer, Boone Ashworth, because Boone uses these amazing pens. They're by the brand Zebra, they're called the Sarasa, what are they called?\nMichael Calore: Sarasa Grand.\nLauren Goode: Sarasa Grand, they're these amazing gel weighted pens. And our pod here, not our podcast pod, but our pod at work here, we sometimes exchange some holiday gifts. And Boone, after I raved about his pen the other day, he was kind enough to get me a gift set of the Zebra Sarasa Grand pens, and they're awesome. So thank you, Boone. And if you're looking for a good pen or a nice little gift set to give to someone who likes pens, I recommend these.\nMichael Calore: Lauren says we sometimes exchange gifts because some of us have exchanged gifts, but I being the cad and forgetting that most people are not going to be around next week, I haven't gotten anybody gifts yet. So hang tight you all.\nLauren Goode: It's OK. Your presence is a gift.\nMichael Calore: No, yeah, it is. But also I do have things in mind that I'm going to get you. So please hold for those. I appreciate it.\nLauren Goode: And Mike, what's your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: OK. My recommendation is on-topic for this week, because last week I was going through our storage closet here at work, and I found a Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin Air, which was the big sort of dooby-shaped black speaker that you put an iPod on. And it has a 30-pin connector on top of it. So it's like an iPod dock, but it's amazing. It sounds wonderful. I think it was a thousand dollars when it came out. So I went further into the closet, and I found my old iPod, and I charged it up and I put it on that thing. And I spent two days just listening to my iPod. And I have to say, owning music and listening to music that you own on a device that is not connected to the internet just feels different. There's something about it. There's something that is sort of like you are settling for what's in your library and not constantly poking around for something else to listen to. There is nothing else to listen to. You have very limited choice, and it really helps you make focused decisions about what you're listening to. So I'm the type of person who fills as many minutes of my day with music as I can, at work, while I'm walking around, at home, while I'm in the kitchen. Even when I'm going to sleep, I listen to music. So having this iPod and having a limited choice of things to listen to has made me revisit a bunch of albums that I normally would not pick if I was just surfing Spotify. So if you have an iPod and you haven't listened to it in a while, bust it out, because there's all kinds of great music on there that you actually own.Steven Levy: Well, here's the thing. I have an iPod Classic, the last one with a good hard drive. And I'm terrified that it's going to die, because when it dies, you can't replace it. So I love to listen to that iPod on a plane ride where I can shuffle my whole collection. But I have to judge whether the trip is going to be worth it to take it, and spend some more time in what is ultimately a limited amount of life left in this pod. So the question is, is this trip iPod-worthy, in the sense that in Seinfeld, Elaine had the sponge-worthy metric on whether she wanted to use a certain kind of contraceptive. So I'm constantly thinking, \"Gee, do I want to listen to music enough to pull out my great clickwheel iPod? Is this iPod-worthy?\"\nMichael Calore: Well, I'll say two things. One, that you can still get iPods. You can buy them on the internet, you can refurbish them, you can get a tool kit and get a hard drive and pop them open and replace the hard drive inside of them. If the hard drive dies, of course, you have to refill it with music, but you can still plug a USB cable somehow into your computer and refill it with music if you have to. So I wouldn't worry so much about losing that particular piece of hardware, because the hardware still for the next few years anyway, will be replaceable. The second thing I'll say is, ride it into the ground. Absolutely. Break that thing. Listen to it so much that it falls apart.\nSteven Levy: Well, after Covid it's all carpe diem for me. So I guess I'll take your advice.\nLauren Goode: There was a period of time when I was using this little waterproofed iPod. What was it, the Nano?\nMichael Calore: The Nano.\nLauren Goode: The one that doesn't have any screen, just the clickwheel.\nMichael Calore: Oh, that's the Shuffle.\nLauren Goode: The Shuffle.\nMichael Calore: The first Shuffle.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I found this company, I wrote about them at one of my previous jobs. This company, I want to say they were in, I don't remember where they were, Oregon maybe, Washington state. And it was just a father-and-son team who would buy these iPod Shuffles in bulk, and then they would waterproof them, and they were for swimming. And they were great. I bought these little waterproof headphones, I clipped the iPod Shuffle to the strap of my bathing suit. And I would listen to music as I was swimming laps. I loved it.\nMichael Calore: That's great.\nLauren Goode: Loved it. And then eventually, I think it just, no matter how well you waterproof it, it got corroded, because it was really not designed to be underwater. Pretty cool though. That's the last one I used.\nMichael Calore: Oh, that's great. All right, well that is our show for this week. Steven, thank you again for joining us.\nSteven Levy: It was all I hoped for. Thank you.\nMichael Calore: And we're glad that you're feeling better. It's good to see you.\nSteven Levy: Thank you.\nMichael Calore: And thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter, still there. Just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth, and we will be back next week.

Experts say it will make the problem worse.","post_content":"IN FEBRUARY 2021, when 246 people in the US state of Texas lost their lives during a powerful storm and its ensuing blackout, the finger of blame was pointed at the state\u2019s faltering electricity grid. Texas, it would emerge, was uniquely ill-equipped to cope with such extreme weather. Built in a time when temperature swings were less extreme, the state\u2019s power plants struggled to operate, creating a supply crisis just as Texans ramped up demand by trying to keep warm. \nTexas found itself trapped and unable to pull power from farther afield, as its grid is isolated from the rest of the US\u2014a measure designed to liberate the state from federal regulation. The brutal winter storm showed that Texas needed a plan to stabilize its grid. Now, it\u2019s found one: bitcoin mining.\nIt might seem counterproductive to invite energy-guzzling bitcoin miners onto a vulnerable grid, but the plan has the support of Texas governor Greg Abbott. In May 2021, Abbott signed into law the Virtual Currency Bill, which legitimized bitcoin and made it easier for miners to come to the state. As he embarks on a third term in office, Abbott says he intends to make Texas the \u201Ccenterpiece\u201D of the Bitcoin movement, which he describes as the \u201Ccutting edge of innovation.\u201D \nFEATURED VIDEO\nFormer NASA Astronaut Breaks Down a Rocket Launch\nAnd it doesn\u2019t get much more \u201Ccutting edge\u201D than using crypto mines to shore up a struggling electricity grid. But Lee Bratcher, founder of the Texas Blockchain Council, a pro-crypto lobbying group, says there\u2019s method to the madness. He claims crypto mining can act like a \u201Cdemand-side battery\u201D that \u201Ccreates a safety valve for the grid,\u201D reducing the likelihood of blackouts.\nIn Bratcher\u2019s terms, it works like this: In periods of low demand, big crypto mines can plug into sources of renewable power that would otherwise be wasted, thereby increasing the profitability of wind and solar and encouraging new development. Then, when demand from the grid is high, miners shut off their operations to allow power to be channeled toward regular people.\nAlthough Texas produces more renewable energy than any other US state, its grid is propped up by an aging fleet of fossil fuel plants, some of which have been running without maintenance to keep pace with energy demand. At an average age of 50 and 30 years, respectively, the state\u2019s coal and gas plants are reaching the end of their useful lives. Core to Abbott\u2019s plan is the theory that the additional demand for energy created by new bitcoin-mining facilities will establish \u201Can investment incentive\u201D that brings new sources of power generation to Texas. Then, when energy demand goes through the roof during a heat wave or cold snap, the state will have more energy flowing through its grid and the option to redirect power as a last resort.\nThe plan to use crypto mines as giant batteries is controversial, to say the least. Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, claims the battery analogy is \u201Cnonsense\u201D because miners don\u2019t store and release energy, but rather only promise to stop consuming when it\u2019s urgently needed elsewhere. And he disputes the idea that crypto mining will bring additional energy generation to the grid, which he describes as misdirection designed to distract from the price increases people will incur due to an overall rise in energy demand.\nDemand for energy in Texas is set to skyrocket as a result of Abbott\u2019s plan. Miners in the state are currently using around 2 gigawatts (GW) of energy, with peak capacity for the state topping out at 80 GW. By 2026 it\u2019s estimated that Texas bitcoin miners will draw as much as 29 GW\u2014four times as much as the whole of New York City. \nFor the opportunity to test his theory, Abbott has the Chinese Communist Party to thank. When China banned crypto mining in June 2021 (outwardly for environmental reasons), some of the world\u2019s largest miners\u2014including Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific, Argo Blockchain, and others\u2014either set up shop or expanded operations in Texas.\nThe miners were attracted to Texas for its cheap power, plentiful supplies of renewable energy, and hands-off approach to regulation. The libertarian ambitions of the cryptocurrency movement, as laid out in the original Bitcoin white paper, also dovetail neatly with the state\u2019s identity. \u201CTexas is all about freedom,\u201D says Andy Long, CEO of crypto mining company White Rock. \u201CSo Texas and Bitcoin go hand-in-hand.\u201D\nThere are now ten industrial-scale mining facilities operating in Texas, the largest of which by power capacity (at 750 megawatts) is operated by Riot and situated on a 100-acre plot in the town of Rockdale. And the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator, says there is a long queue of companies awaiting approval for new mining installations.\nThe way facilities receive their energy differs on a case-by-case basis. To power its mining equipment in west Texas, Marathon Digital draws partly from the grid and partly from so-called stranded energy\u2014power from solar and wind farms that isn\u2019t needed by the grid or cannot be sold due to infrastructure constraints. In exchange for Marathon agreeing to purchase energy at a set rate at all hours of the day, the renewable provider gives the firm a cut of the profits whenever the grid is willing to pay a higher price, benefitting both parties.\nAnother way miners can turn a profit is by participating in ERCOT demand response programs, which for years have provided a way for factories and other industry-scale energy consumers to help stabilize the grid. Under this system, mining companies that buy energy in batches are compensated for switching off when a blackout looms. Meanwhile, those that have power purchase agreements (contracts that allow them to buy energy in advance at a set price) with energy suppliers can shut off when demand is high and sell their allocation to the grid at a premium.According to Trudi Webster, a spokesperson for ERCOT, this arrangement helps to \u201Cmaintain grid reliability\u201D because participants can \u201Cincrease or decrease consumption to support system needs.\u201D This principle was put to the test in July, when a heat wave drove energy consumption to record highs and 95 percent of large-scale miners in Texas were said to have shut down. One mining company, Riot, said it earned $9.5 million in energy credits during the heat wave for switching off operations, more revenue than it earned from mining bitcoin in the same period (roughly $6.9 million).\nFred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, claims that crypto miners participating in demand response schemes have helped to stave off blackouts in Texas this year. Mining facilities acted \u201Clike a capacitor,\u201D he says, echoing the battery metaphor, allowing the grid to remain on an even keel.\nEnthusiasm for the plan from Abbott and other crypto enthusiasts has been punctured by academics who claim even the basic premise is flawed. The idea of using huge crypto mines to control energy demand is based on \u201Cmisunderstandings and misrepresentations of the grid and how it operates,\u201D says Adrian Shelley, an energy policy expert and branch director of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Although crypto mines are unique in their ability to switch off at short notice (unlike a factory, which may take hours to shut down), Shelley says the case for placing the extra strain on the grid in the first place is full of holes. Abbott\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\nShelley argues it \u201Cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201D to pay miners for alleviating the strain they themselves are putting on the grid. In addition, much of the miners\u2019 purchasing power gained directly from the grid is likely to decrease when demand spikes, as mining is no longer profitable under these conditions due to the rise in energy prices.\nHirs says there are millions of consumers already connected to the grid that would happily shut off their power in exchange for financial compensation, without adding additional strain to the grid or causing a price increase. Under the instruction of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the state utilities regulator, ERCOT launched a pilot program earlier this month to investigate how regular people can help support grid reliability\u2014but Hirs says this should have happened years ago.\nThe flood of crypto miners arriving in Texas has also attracted the attention of lawmakers. In a letter addressed to ERCOT, a group of US politicians headed by US senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) expressed fears that crypto mining will \u201Cadd to the stress on the state\u2019s power grid.\u201D Shelley shares the same concern: \u201CThere\u2019s no way the grid could handle all that demand,\u201D he says.\nIn its response to the letter, ERCOT explained it will not allow new mining facilities to power up if there is a risk of destabilizing the grid. But the operator also said it\u2019s not in the business of predicting the impact of mining on the price of energy for consumers. Doug Lewin, president of Stoic Energy, a Texas-based energy consultancy, is worried about a different problem: What happens if miners decide not to switch off their machines? While the price of bitcoin sits at $17,000 per coin (down 63 percent this year), miners stand to profit by shutting down. But if the price were to rise, a tipping point would be reached whereby continuing to mine becomes the more lucrative option.\nSome mining companies, like Marathon, are contractually obligated to shut down when demand spikes. But if others choose not to, they would be competing with consumer demand and increasing the risk of a blackout, says Lewin, who argues regulation is needed to mitigate this worst case scenario.\nBratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council says he expects ERCOT to ask all miners to sign agreements demanding they halt their operations if power reserves fall below 3GW.

But with technology advancing faster than ever before, enterprises across the world are finding it harder and harder to bring that goal to scale. Sylvain Duranton, a global lead at BCG X\u2014Boston Consulting Group\u2019s new tech build and design unit\u2014has an idea of what can get today\u2019s organizations back on track. \nWIRED Brand Lab:\nLet's start broadly, shall we? What kind of impact do you think today's large organizations are seeing from their digital investments over the last 10 years? Are they paying off? Or is that still TBD? \nSylvain Duranton:\nI think there's quite a gap between the hype and reality. We have corporate data on that; out of those who are really pushing digital transformation, only 30 percent of companies are starting to see some real financial impact through their transformation effort.\nIn this 30 percent, a small subset is seeing massive impact or several percentage points of incremental EBIDTA, or they\u2019re gaining a much stronger competitive position. Others are making some incremental impact. But all in all, although everyone is talking about digital transformation, it\u2019s had a positive impact in only 30 percent of cases.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nWhy is that number so low? What is holding 70 percent of companies back from seeing impact?\nDuranton:\nIf you ask most companies, \"Did you tick the box of using AI?\" They would say yes. Same with, \"Did you tick the box of having a center of expertise?\" Yes. \u201CDid you tick the box of recruiting new talent?\u201D Yes. The list goes on. Many boxes have been ticked and money has been spent. But if you ask C-suite members, \"What are the three massively disruptive things that you have at scale that have made a difference on your market or customers?\" Then the answer is not so easy. \nThe main challenge has been to scale: Many companies have done many things, but very few have scaled in the end. The promise is still there, but that promise has not yet materialized. Typically, what we see is lots of small initiatives\u2014thousands of flowers blooming at one company, because everyone wants to do a bit of digital somewhere in the company. And in the end, the company is diluting the investment.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nIsn\u2019t that diversification a good thing, though? Isn\u2019t it safer to seed a variety of digital efforts, as opposed to just one or two?\nDuranton:\nThat approach often ignores how challenging true change is. I think the fundamental mistake is that companies underestimate how much change is needed to derive value from technology versus just implementing technology. I think 10 percent of the effort needed is after building a disruptive technology itself; another 20 percent of the effort will be spent integrating this technology into your legacy technology. \nThe remaining 70 percent of the effort lies in changing the organization and its processes and ways of working. If you just want to automate something simple, then okay, you don't need to change the way the company works. But if you use AI to make or support business decisions, then that could mean different teams, different people, and different processes. You might have to completely change the way people work, and that's very hard. Many companies think it's all about building a new technology: They focus on the 10 percent of the work, and they don't do the full 100 percent. This is why we don't see those technologies at scale as much as society thinks we should.WIRED Brand Lab:\nDo you think a lot of companies fundamentally don't understand that, or do you think they avoid that deeper effort? \nDuranton:\nI think they underestimate the amount of change required. Most can only do it on a few very big topics within the organization. Many companies have launched too many things and cannot invest enough in each of them. \nIt's like taking a rocket to space. To get off the ground, you need massive amounts of energy. I think the best way to allocate this (organizational) energy is on just two or three big things that will make a real difference. If you aren\u2019t focused, you don't get any meaningful results, and then people start to lose patience. Once you've completed a few of those builds, you've been forced to change the way some of your teams operate, and you've been forced to create some smart data architecture on top of your legacy IT. Then it's a bit self-propelled and you have much less resistance. The first few big victories are super costly.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nHow should companies identify those two or three major efforts where they should focus their investment?\nDuranton:\nYou need to pick a topic where you are convinced that the business people in charge of that 70 percent\u2014the change effort\u2014are up for it. I've seen many discussions at companies where someone says, \"Okay, why not apply something tech-focused to this process?\" Then you have the business owners say, \"Yeah, why not?\" You can't start like that. You need to start with the commitment that the technology will be used. \nIf you don't have that commitment, and if you don't provide resources for that team to work on that initiative right now, it's just lab work: \u201CWe can show you a shiny object, but there\u2019s nothing in the end.\u201D So that commitment is what is hard to get. Leadership teams need to focus on the place where leaders will have the right mindset and the appetite to really disrupt the organization and work in this new way.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nSuch massive organizational efforts will surely require changes in talent, either through new hiring or upskilling. How should companies approach that aspect?\nDuranton:\nTwo important things here: There are the skills of people that will be users of technology, and there are the skills of people who will be builders of technology. \nFor users of the technology, there is massive upskilling that is required. It\u2019s not just telling them about what AI can do, it\u2019s saying, \u201COkay, concretely, this new solution in your hand\u2014what\u2019s the impact?\u201D Then you\u2019ve got the builders, which is where I don't think companies will be able to internalize everything required. There's a war for talent out there. Even if you open your checkbook and you write big checks to recruit people, the challenge is to make sure that those talents continue to learn and provide.\nFew companies can really build an end-to-end team of people who can work on everything from blockchain to AI. You need a full ecosystem there. You need a huge network. In most situations, it should be a combination of internal and external resources.WIRED Brand Lab:\nThe kind of effort you\u2019re describing for true transformational change is enormous. Do you think companies will be scared off of that as we head into what feels like a very uncertain 2023 market?\nDuranton:\nWe've done a survey on this. 60 percent of the companies that we surveyed say that they want to increase their investments into digital technology, AI, and digital transformation; 36 percent say they just want to continue as-is. Only 4 percent say they should be decreasing investment. \n\nI think companies understand that the need to innovate is bigger than ever in the current market situation, either to steer operations in a very uncertain world or to innovate for your clients. We need technology to move through crises. We saw that a lot with the Covid crisis, where companies who were more advanced in terms of technology could better manage the situation, and companies who were lacking suffered a lot from the competitive standpoint. Everyone is sort of sensing that pressure will increase in 2023, and those who master technology will take advantage of that.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nHow much is consumer expectation driving that general market pressure?\nDuranton:\nIt is a massive market force, and it will accelerate because there's a generational thing here. The new generation, they have no patience for many of the things that some of the more traditional companies are doing and the way they operate. That's why, for many companies, it's a question of survival: If you don't adapt to the future or current world, as defined by digital standards, you will be out of business pretty soon.\nThat push has been really coming from the digital world, from people who think it's no longer acceptable to be dealt with so badly in so many instances of our life as citizens or as consumers.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nBut how many of the technologies that consumers are hearing about in the media every day are really ready for mass deployment, and how many are still just hype?\nDuranton:\nAI, I think, is there. We can discuss how it is still changing, but AI is there. Quantum computing is not there and won't be there for some time. We've had the hype period on the metaverse, but now we have a bit of a backlash mode on the metaverse. There are doubts in the minds of many consumers of that really bringing something to the world. My sense is we need a bit of patience on that one. \nAs long as the customer experience is not there, something will not take off. For example, in 1993, I was working in the research lab for electric vehicles. Everyone was excited. It was cool. But the demand wasn't there. After the hype, things cooled down. Then Tesla came in. Everyone sees a Tesla, they feel it's cool, and they want it. Now it's picking up. In the end, customer experience is the name of the game. And with the metaverse, it is not there. The three things where companies have highest expectations in the short term are advanced AI, blockchain, and the internet of things (IoT), because they need this architecture to be able to have much more pervasive device support and real-time decision support in a decentralized way.WIRED Brand Lab:\nWhat are the three things you\u2019re most excited about?\nDuranton:\nIt's a combination of advanced AI, blockchain, and synthetic biology (synbio). I think synbio has intangible potential, but I think combining the three can solve the biggest challenges for companies and for the world.\nI'm sure that in 10 years, from a tech standpoint, we'll be in a completely new world. What has happened over the last 20 years or 30 years will now happen much faster. When you talk to companies, governments, citizens, and consumers, there's a massive appetite for more innovation. And when you talk to people in the labs, they have massive innovations on the shelf.\nWe need to connect the dots here and start materializing the promise of technology. And I think that is what will happen in the next five to 10 years. I'm positive that the world will be very different.\nWIRED Brand Lab:\nIt feels like BCG has a key role to play in that advancement\u2014especially with the launch of its new team, BCG X. Tell us a little about that group and its mission. \nDuranton:\nThe mission statement is to partner with companies to really make the promise of technology a reality, and to then help large corporations scale this disruptive technology. \"X\" is a symbol of multiplication, and we want to generate big outcomes\u2014multiplying outcomes by two, three, or 10 times. It's a big ambition, because I think we need big ambition.\nPart of the idea of multiplication is also that joining forces helps. It's joining forces with our clients, who are our partners\u2014we believe in the notion of multiplying talents to multiply your impact. Like I said at the beginning, digital transformation has stalled for most companies; we want to be the solution for that. \nCompanies are getting frustrated with their traditional tech vendors. It's slow, they don't see things progress enough, and they need more. That's a result of being too tech-centric when you do things. Our mission with BCG X is that, combined with BCG, we provide the partnership to companies that's as much business as it is tech. You need both because of the 70 percent\u2014where you need to be able to change the organization and change the way the company works.\nIs your organization looking to create its own transformational change? See how Duranton\u2019s BCG X team can help your company take the next step on its digital journey. \nThis article was produced by WIRED Brand Lab on behalf of Boston Consulting Group.","post_cover":null,"author":null,"title":"What's Hype and What\u2019s Not?

But one refugee hatched his own plan.","post_content":"CONTENT WARNING: This story includes references to suicide. If you need help, call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline for your region.\nCHAPTER 14\nTHE STING\nIN THE DAYS after the AlphaBay takedown but before Alexandre Cazes' death, Paul Hemesath spent a few enjoyable hours by the rooftop pool of the Athenee, scrolling on his iPad through the responses to the sudden, unexplained disappearance of the world's largest-ever dark-web market.\nRumors had begun to swirl instantly that the site's administrators had pulled off an exit scam, taking with them millions of dollars' worth of the market's cryptocurrency. But others argued that the site might just be down for technical reasons or to carry out routine maintenance. Few suspected the truth. \u201CPeople have always screamed exit scam in the past, and they've always been wrong,\u201D wrote one user on Reddit. \u201CI really hope this turns out the same.\u201D Another added, \u201CUntil we know otherwise, keep the faith.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\n Almost immediately, faithful or not, AlphaBay's vendors and buyers went looking for a new market where they could continue business as usual. The natural choice was AlphaBay's biggest rival, Hansa, which was well run and already growing fast. \u201Cwow alphabay exit scam. crazyness!\u201D one user wrote on Twitter. \u201Cmoving to hansa.\u201D\nThis story is excerpted from Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available now from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nBack in the Netherlands, the Dutch police were waiting for them. For two weeks, they had been overseeing Hansa's vast marketplace, surveilling its users and collecting their messages, delivery addresses, and passwords. Their Driebergen conference room, where the small team of undercover investigators had continued to work in shifts around the clock, had taken on the atmosphere of a college dorm. Chips, cookies, chocolates, and energy drinks covered the table, a warm, stale funk pervading the air.\nAt one point the head of investigations for the Dutch National Police paid them a visit to see their landmark operation in action. He was visibly offended by the smell and left after 10 minutes. Someone brought in an air freshener. (\u201CIt didn't really work,\u201D a team member says.)\nHansa's marketplace, meanwhile, was thriving. In the days before the AlphaBay takedown, it was adding nearly a thousand new registered users a day, all falling into the trap the Dutch had patiently set. When AlphaBay went offline, that number spiked to more than 4,000 a day. Then more than 5,000 the next day. Then, two days after that, 6,000.Soon, as the market absorbed AlphaBay's wayward users, the Dutch team was logging a thousand daily transactions. The paperwork of tracking and sending those order records to Europol\u2014not to mention attempting to intercept every order shipped to the Netherlands\u2014became so massive that the police were briefly overwhelmed. They reluctantly decided to shut down new registrations for a full week. \u201CDue to the influx of Alphabay refugees we are dealing with technical issues,\u201D read a message they posted to the site. Those refugees, however, remained so eager to join that some Hansa users began selling their accounts on web forums, like scalpers selling tickets to a concert.\nThen, in the middle of that week, on July 13, one prong of Operation Bayonet suddenly slipped into the light. The Wall Street Journal broke the news that AlphaBay had been taken down by a joint law enforcement operation involving the US, Thai, and Canadian governments and that the site's administrator, Alexandre Cazes, had been found dead in a Thai jail cell.\nThere was no mention in the article of Hansa or the Dutch police. And when the Dutch reached out to the FBI, they were surprised and relieved to find that the Americans were willing to keep mum\u2014to follow the Dutch team's lead and delay any announcement of the entirety of Operation Bayonet. The still-operational, undercover half of their one-two punch would remain hidden for as long as the Dutch chose to pursue it.\nSo a week after pausing new registrations on Hansa, the Driebergen team turned them on again. New user sign-ups soon spiked to more than 7,000 a day.\nTHE DUTCH KNEW that their operation couldn't go on indefinitely. They could see the moment approaching when they would have to take off their masks, reveal their surveillance coup, and tear down the market they'd so carefully rebuilt and maintained. They were, after all, facilitating drug sales, not all of which were being intercepted in the mail.\nThe closer they got to the end of the sting, meanwhile, the less they had to lose if they were discovered\u2014and the more risks they were willing to take.\nThroughout the operation, the Dutch team would hold what they called \u201Cevil plan\u201D meetings, brainstorming ever more devious schemes to track and identify the unwitting users of the market they controlled. They created a list of those tactics, ordering the menu of surveillance actions from least to most likely to blow their cover. As they reached their endgame, they began to put their most brazen ideas into practice.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay  companion newsletter. \nHansa had long ago implemented a standard feature for dark-web markets, designed to protect their vendors: When sellers uploaded images for their product listings, the site automatically stripped those images of their metadata\u2014information nested within the file, such as what sort of camera had taken the photo and the GPS location of where the image was created. The Dutch had silently sabotaged that feature early on, recording images' metadata before it was stripped, so as to catalog uploaders' locations. But they had managed to pinpoint only a few vendors that way; they found that most rarely updated their listings or posted new photos.\nSo, a few weeks into their takeover, the police wiped every image from the site. They claimed that a server had failed due to a technical glitch, and they announced that vendors would have to re-upload all the images for their listings. Those fresh uploads allowed the Dutch cops to scrape the metadata from a vast new batch of images. They quickly obtained the locations of 50 more of the site's dealers.In another scheme in the last days of their operation, the Driebergen team came up with an idea for how to get the IP addresses of the site's sellers, despite their use of the anonymity software Tor. It involved a sort of Trojan horse. Hansa's administrators announced that they were offering an Excel file to vendors that included codes that would allow them to retrieve their bitcoins stored in escrow on the market, even if the site was taken down. When only a small number of Hansa's dealers took them up on the offer, the police tried adding more helpful information to it, designed to lure vendors, like buyer statistics that would let the sellers track and rank their best customers. When even that feature got lackluster adoption, the Dutch cops pushed their ruse to its extreme: They warned the site's users that they had detected suspicious activity on their servers and said all vendors should download the backup cryptocurrency retrieval file immediately or risk losing their funds.\nAll the while, of course, the files the team was pushing on vendors were functioning as secret digital beacons. The top left of the Excel spreadsheet displayed an image of the Hansa logo, a stylized Viking ship. The police had designed the Excel file to fetch that image from their own server when the spreadsheet was opened. As a result, they could see the IP address of every computer requesting it. Sixty-four sellers on the market took the bait.\nIn the most involved scheme of all, the Dutch team turned their sights to the staff of the marketplace itself, the moderators who were directly working for them. They'd found that one moderator in particular was extremely dedicated\u2014very \u201Cemotionally involved\u201D in the site, as the team lead, Petra Haandrikman, put it. The Dutch team felt a collective sense of admiration and affection for this hard worker\u2014while simultaneously hatching a scheme to try to arrest him.\nThey offered him a promotion. Hansa's two bosses would give him a raise, but only if he agreed to become a third admin of the site. The moderator was overjoyed, immediately accepting. Then they explained that for him to become an admin, they'd have to either arrange a meeting in person or get his mailing address so that they could send him a two-factor authentication token\u2014a physical USB stick plugged into a PC to prove his identity and keep his account secure.\nIn his next message, the moderator's tone suddenly changed. He explained that he had made a promise to himself that if his bosses at Hansa ever asked for his identifying information or tried to meet him in person, he would immediately quit and wipe all of the devices he had used in his moderator job. Now he planned to abide by that promise. He said goodbye.\nThat moderator's sudden decision\u2014a very wise one, likely saving him from a prison sentence\u2014meant that the admins now had an opening to fill. So they began advertising that they were taking applications for a new moderator. At the end of a series of questions about qualifications and experience, they would ask \u201Csuccessful\u201D applicants for their address so that they could mail them a two-factor authentication token. Some, eager for the job, handed over the locations of their homes. \u201CPlease don't send the cops to this address hahahahahaha just kidding,\u201D one would-be moderator wrote, as he, in fact, sent his address to the cops. \u201CI trust you guys because Hansa support was always good and helpful.\u201DSavvier dark-web users, of course, never gave out their home addresses. In cases where they needed to receive a package, they sent shippers the address of a \u201Cdrop\u201D\u2014a location away from their homes where they could, if necessary, deny the package was theirs.\nTo circumvent that safeguard, the Dutch police went one step further: For moderator applicants who provided a drop address, they shipped them the two-factor token hidden inside the packaging of a teddy bear, a cute stuffed panda with a soft pink nose. They intended the panda to appear as an innocuous disguise to hide the authentication token, a sign of their new employers' attention to opsec\u2014and, perhaps, their sense of humor.\nThe Dutch cops hoped their targets would take the stuffed pandas home as a kind of gift or souvenir. Unbeknownst to the recipients, each one also contained, hidden deep in its stuffing, a small GPS tracker.\nCHAPTER 15\nPANIC\nON JULY 20, after running Hansa for 27 days, the Dutch prosecutors decided it was finally time to give up their game\u2014over the objections of several members of the Driebergen team controlling the site, who had more ideas for surveillance tricks still up their sleeves.\nIn a press conference at the Dutch police's national headquarters in The Hague, the head of the agency dramatically pressed a large red plastic button to shut down the site. (In fact, the button was just a prop; an agent sitting nearby with a laptop sent the simultaneous command to the server that finally pulled Hansa offline.) Simultaneously, the US Justice Department announced the news in a DC press conference in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke about the coordinated action against both AlphaBay and Hansa. Sessions used the opportunity to issue a warning to the dark web's users. \u201CYou are not safe. You cannot hide,\u201D he told them, from a packed room of reporters and cameras. \u201CWe will find you, dismantle your organization and network. And we will prosecute you.\u201DNearly 16 days after it had inexplicably disappeared, the AlphaBay site rematerialized with a notice covered in law enforcement agency logos and words that would be familiar to any Silk Road user: \u201CTHIS HIDDEN SITE HAS BEEN SEIZED.\u201D\nThe Dutch, meanwhile, put up a slightly different message on Hansa: \u201CTHIS HIDDEN SITE HAS BEEN SEIZED and controlled since June 20.\u201D The Dutch seizure notice linked to another dark-web site that the police had created themselves, which listed dark-web vendors by pseudonym under three categories: those under investigation, those who had been identified, and those who had been arrested\u2014a list that they suggested was about to grow significantly. \u201CWe trace people who are active at Dark Markets and offer illicit goods or services,\u201D the site read. \u201CAre you one of them? Then you have our attention.\u201D\nThe Dutch team in Driebergen, even after exposing their operation, still had one last card to play: They decided to try the usernames and passwords they had already collected from Hansa on the largest surviving dark-web drug bazaar, known as Dream Market. They found that at least 12 of that site's dealers had reused their Hansa credentials there. They were able to immediately take over those accounts and lock out the vendors\u2014who promptly posted panicked messages to public forums suggesting that Dream had been compromised as well.\nAll of that carefully coordinated agitprop and disruption was expressly designed to sow fear and uncertainty across the dark-web community\u2014to \u201Cdamage the trust in this whole system,\u201D as the Dutch police's Marinus Boekelo said.\nIt had its immediate intended effect. \u201CLooks like I'll be sober for a while. Not trusting any markets,\u201D wrote one user on Reddit.\n\u201CDO NOT MAKE NEW ORDERS ON ANY DNM ANY MORE!\u201D wrote another, using the common abbreviation for \u201Cdark net market.\u201D\n\u201CSo it's a wrap for the darknet?\u201D one user asked.\n\u201CTo everyone who thinks they're screwed and wants to flee the country,\u201D another advised, \u201Cdo so ASAP.\u201D\nTHAT ALL-PERVADING PARANOIA was, for many of the dark web's users, warranted. In their nearly four weeks of running Hansa, the Dutch had surveilled 27,000 transactions. After shutting down the site, they seized 1,200 bitcoins from Hansa, worth tens of millions of dollars as of this writing, thanks in part to silently sabotaging the site's implementation of a Bitcoin feature called multi-signature transactions, designed to make that sort of simple confiscation impossible. They had collected at least some amount of data on a staggering total of 420,000 users, including more than 10,000 home addresses.\nIn the months following the takeover, Gert Ras, the head of the unit that oversaw the operation, said Dutch police carried out around 50 \u201Cknock and talks\u201D in the Netherlands, visiting known buyers to warn them they had been identified and should stop purchasing narcotics online, though he said they arrested only one high-volume customer.\nThe site's sellers weren't so lucky: Within a year, more than a dozen of Hansa's top dealers had been arrested. Finally, the Dutch police fed the massive corpus of dark-web data they'd collected into a database controlled by Europol, which in turn shared it with law enforcement agencies around the world.The direct ripple effects of that explosion of incriminating data, passed through so many institutions' records, aren't easy to track. But over the following years, Grant Rabenn, who served as custodian of the files the Justice Department had assembled from Operation Bayonet, says he received requests for that information as part of dozens of cases that agencies across the United States were still pursuing.\nA series of massive, high-profile dark-web busts would follow. These operations were all carried out by a new group known as JCODE, or Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement, pulling together agents from the FBI, DEA, Department of Homeland Security, US Postal Inspection Service, and half a dozen other federal agencies: in 2018, Operation Disarray; in 2019, Operation SaboTor; in 2020, Operation DisrupTor. In total, according to the FBI, those enforcement campaigns would eventually result in more than 240 arrests, 160 \u201Cknock and talks,\u201D and the seizure of more than 1,700 pounds of drugs, along with $13.5 million in cash and cryptocurrency.\nBut the Hansa side of the operation was not without costs. Aside from the vast manpower and resources Operation Bayonet had required, it had demanded that a group of Dutch police become dark-web kingpins. For nearly a month, they had facilitated the sale of untold quantities of deadly narcotics to unknown buyers across the world. Even as they compromised Hansa, Hansa had compromised them too.\nDid the Dutch police feel that sense of taint\u2014taint that perhaps comes with any undercover work? Some, at least, describe feeling surprisingly unconflicted about their role. \u201CTo be honest, it was exciting, mostly,\u201D said the team lead, Petra Haandrikman. Dutch prosecutors had, after all, already reviewed the case, weighed its ethics, and given them the green light. After that, the police involved felt they could push the operation as far as possible with a clean conscience.\nThe Dutch police pointed out that they did ban the especially deadly opiate fentanyl from Hansa while it was under their control, in an effort to minimize the harm they might be responsible for\u2014a move Hansa's users actually applauded. In truth, however, that ban had come just a few days before the end of their undercover operation. Until then, for more than three weeks, that highly dangerous opioid had continued to be offered on the site, with no guarantee that all of its orders would be intercepted.\nAnd how did the police feel about the decision to oversee those narcotics sales rather than shut Hansa down and prevent the transactions altogether?\n\u201CThey would have taken place anyway,\u201D Gert Ras said without hesitation, \u201Cbut on a different market.\u201D\n\u201CI welcome you to the re-opening of our professionally-run, anonymous, secure marketplace AlphaBay,\u201D DeSnake\u2019s message began.\nIN THE YEARS since, the dark web's observers have tried to determine to what extent Operation Bayonet actually disrupted that endless interchangeability of markets, the constant cycle of raid, rebuild, and repeat. Could the highly coordinated global takedown of AlphaBay\u2014or anything else\u2014end or even slow the eternal shell game law enforcement agencies had by then been playing for years, with a new market constantly ready to absorb the users of the last?\nOne study, at least, suggested that the AlphaBay and Hansa busts had more lasting effects than previous dark-web takedowns. The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, which goes by the acronym TNO, found that when other markets had been seized, like the Silk Road or Silk Road 2, most of their drug vendors soon showed up on other dark-web drug sites. But the vendors who fled Hansa after Bayonet's one-two punch didn't reappear, or if they did, they had been forced to scrub their identities and reputations, re-creating themselves from scratch. \u201CCompared to both the Silk Road takedowns, or even the AlphaBay takedown, the Hansa Market shutdown stands out in a positive way,\u201D the TNO report read. \u201CWe see the first signs of game-changing police intervention.\u201DCarnegie Mellon's Nicolas Christin, a quantitative researcher of dark-web drug markets with an especially long track record, isn't so sure. Based on data he and his fellow researchers assembled by analyzing feedback posted to markets, they conservatively estimated that AlphaBay was generating between $600,000 and $800,000 a day in sales before it was shut down, well over double Silk Road's peak revenue. But his team found that the next inheritor of the dark web's refugees, Dream Market, eventually grew to become almost as big as AlphaBay, or perhaps even bigger\u2014before its administrators disappeared and the market quietly dropped offline in 2019.\nChainalysis' blockchain-based measurements, by contrast, found that AlphaBay was generating as much as $2 million a day in average sales just before its shutdown\u2014revenue that no other dark-web market of its kind has ever rivaled. (The Russian-language dark-web site Hydra, which was pulled offline by German law enforcement in April 2022, did top those numbers, taking in more than $1.7 billion in bitcoin in 2021, according to Chainalysis. But because its black-market contraband sales were difficult to distinguish from its money-laundering services, its inflows of cryptocurrency aren't directly comparable to AlphaBay's.) The FBI has estimated that Cazes' site, with more than 369,000 product listings and 400,000 users at its peak, was 10 times the size of Silk Road when it was pulled offline.\nRegardless of who holds the title for the largest dark-web market of all time, Christin predicts that this anonymous contraband economy cycle will continue long after the dark web's memory of Operation Bayonet has faded, as long as there are buyers for illegal, lucrative, and often highly addictive products.\n\u201CHistory has taught us that this ecosystem is very, very resilient,\u201D he says. \u201CWhat happened in 2017 was very unique, that one-two punch. But that doesn't seem to have dented the ecosystem in a major way.\u201D\nEven on the day that the Hansa takedown was announced and Operation Bayonet was finally revealed, some users seemed ready to return to the dark web as soon as the chaos subsided, and their insatiable need for another fix began to make itself felt. The very same Reddit user who had posted to the site's dark-net market forum that they would be \u201Csober for a while\u201D ended their message with a note of stubborn persistence.\n\u201CThings will stabilize, they always do,\u201D that anonymous user wrote. \u201CThe Great Game of whack-a-mole never ends.\u201D\nCHAPTER 16\nRESURRECTION\nIN EARLY AUGUST 2021, just as I was reporting out the final details of AlphaBay's downfall, something unexpected happened: It rose from the dead.\n\u201CAlphaBay is back,\u201D read a message posted to Ghostbin, a site for publishing anonymous text-based messages. \u201CYou read that right, AlphaBay is back.\u201DThe message appeared to be authored by DeSnake, AlphaBay's former number two administrator and security specialist. To prove his identity, DeSnake had cryptographically signed the message with his PGP key\u2014a method to show that the writer of the message possessed the long, secret series of characters that only DeSnake had access to, like a king stamping a letter with a personal signet ring. Multiple security researchers privately confirmed that the signature matched the one from DeSnake's messages as an AlphaBay administrator years earlier. The author seemed to be AlphaBay's long-lost lieutenant\u2014or, at the very least, someone who'd gotten ahold of his key.\n\u201CI welcome you to the re-opening of our professionally-run, anonymous, secure marketplace AlphaBay to buy or sell products and services,\u201D DeSnake's message began. The staff of this new AlphaBay, he wrote, had \u201C20 years of experience in computer security alone, underground businesses, darknet market management, customer support and most importantly evading Law Enforcement.\u201D\nSure enough, when I entered the site's address into a Tor browser, a reincarnated AlphaBay appeared\u2014albeit a newly launched one. It was the same market as the one last seen in 2017, but restarted from scratch, with none of AlphaBay's many thousands of vendors. And there was another major difference: Now that he had taken over from Alpha02, DeSnake allowed transactions only in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero, not Bitcoin, to prevent the blockchain analysis that had played such a central role in AlphaBay's takedown.\nI reached out to DeSnake for an interview, writing to his account on the Tor-protected web forum Dread. Within 24 hours, I found myself exchanging encrypted instant messages with the newly resurfaced, would-be kingpin of the dark web.\nDeSnake quickly explained why he had reappeared only now\u2014fully four years after the original AlphaBay had been torn offline, after Cazes had died in jail and the rest of AlphaBay's staff had scattered. He had intended, he wrote, to retire after AlphaBay was seized, but his plans changed after he saw the news that an FBI agent involved in the AlphaBay takedown had shown a video of Cazes' arrest at the 2018 Fordham International Conference on Cyber Security and had spoken about Cazes in a way that DeSnake deemed disrespectful.\n\u201CThe biggest reason I am returning is to make the AlphaBay name be remembered as more than the marketplace which got busted and the founder made out to have committed suicide,\u201D DeSnake wrote, in his slightly foreign-inflected English. \u201CAlphaBay name was put in bad light after the raids. I am here to make amends to that.\u201D\nDeSnake repeated the claim I'd heard before: that Cazes was murdered in jail. He offered no real evidence but said that he and Alpha02 had developed a contingency plan in case of his arrest\u2014a kind of automated mechanism that would reveal Alpha02's identity to DeSnake if he disappeared for a certain amount of time, so that AlphaBay's number two could help him in jail. (Whether that help would have come in the form of a legal defense fund or the \u201Chelicopter gunship\u201D Cazes had mentioned to Jen Sanchez, DeSnake refused to say.)Cazes would never have killed himself before their plan could even go into effect, DeSnake argued. \u201CHe was a fighter,\u201D he wrote. \u201CMe and him had backup plan, I guarantee you that a good and working one, backed by funds etc. However he got killed.\u201D\nDeSnake described countermeasures he'd since developed for practically every tactic that had been used to capture Cazes and take down the original AlphaBay. DeSnake never stepped away from his computer when it was unlocked, he wrote, not even to use the bathroom. He claimed to use an \u201Camnesiac\u201D operating system to avoid storing incriminating data, as well as \u201Ckill switches\u201D to destroy any remaining information that law enforcement might find on his machines, should they leave his control. He even wrote that he'd designed a system called AlphaGuard that will automatically set up new servers if it detects that the ones that run the site are being seized.\nBut the biggest factor protecting DeSnake was almost certainly geographic: He wrote that he's based in a former USSR country, beyond Western governments' reach. While he acknowledged that Cazes had used fake clues to suggest a Russian nationality to throw off investigators, he claimed that AlphaBay's ban on victimizing people from that part of the world was genuine and designed to protect him and other actual post-Soviet citizen AlphaBay staffers from local law enforcement.\n\u201CWe did that for security of other staff members,\u201D DeSnake wrote. Cazes then \u201Cdecided to embrace it as a way to secure himself.\u201D\nEven so, DeSnake claimed that he had traveled multiple times through countries with US extradition treaties and had never been caught. He credited that track record in part to his careful money laundering, though aside from his preference for Monero, he declined to detail his methods.\n\u201CAnyone who believed any currency method or cryptocurrency is safe is a fool or at the very least very ignorant. Everything is tracked,\u201D he wrote. \u201CYou have to go through certain methods to be able to enjoy the fruits of your work \u2026 it costs to do what you do. If you are a legit business you pay taxes. If you are doing this you pay taxes in forms of obfuscating your money.\u201D\nDeSnake said he was shocked when he learned of Alpha02's early slipup that first revealed his email address to the DEA. \u201CI am still in disbelief to this day that he had put his personal email on there,\u201D DeSnake wrote. \u201CHe was a good carder and he knew better opsec.\u201D\nBut he added that Cazes' failure to hide his money trails to the degree DeSnake recommended was a more willful mistake. DeSnake had warned the previous AlphaBay boss about the need to take more measures against financial surveillance, he said. Alpha02 hadn't listened.\n\u201CSome advice he took, other he disgarded as \u2018overkill,\u2019\u201D DeSnake wrote. \u201CIn this game there is no overkill.\u201D\nONE AFTERNOON, AT the end of several weeks of on-and-off chats with DeSnake about how he planned to win this next round of the dark web's cat-and-mouse game, he shared some news: The mice had scored another small victory.DeSnake sent me a series of links to Tor-protected websites that he described as \u201CDarkLeaks.\u201D Someone, it seems, had hacked the Italian police agency responsible for investigating a pair of dark-web drug sites, known as Deep Sea and Berlusconi Market. Now that hacker had published a broad collection of stolen documents that offered an inside view into law enforcement's secret work to take down those sites.\nWithin the DarkLeaks collection, one slide deck immediately caught my eye. It was a presentation from Chainalysis. It described, in Italian, a remarkable set of surveillance tricks that Chainalysis offered law enforcement but that had never before been publicly revealed, including the ability to trace Monero in a majority of cases. The slides even seemed to reveal that Chainalysis had turned a free blockchain analysis tool it had acquired, WalletExplorer, into a honeypot: The company had turned over identifying information to law enforcement about people who used the tool to check the traceability of their coins.\nBut amid these revelations, there was another slide that finally offered the most elusive answer I'd been looking for: a possible solution to the mystery of the \u201Cadvanced analysis\u201D trick Chainalysis had used to locate the AlphaBay server in Lithuania.\nThe Italian presentation confirmed that Chainalysis can, in fact, identify the IP addresses of some wallets on the blockchain. It did so by running its own Bitcoin nodes, which quietly monitored transaction messages. This appeared to be the very practice that had led to a scandal in the company's earliest days, when it was revealed that Chainalysis was running its own Bitcoin nodes to collect the IP addresses of cryptocurrency users\u2014an experiment it had promised was shut down after an outcry about it spread across the Bitcoin community.\nOne slide in particular described a tool called Rumker, explaining that Chainalysis could use its surreptitious Bitcoin nodes to identify the IP addresses of anonymous services, including dark-web markets. \u201CAlthough many illegal services run on the Tor network, suspects are often negligent and run their bitcoin node on clearnet,\u201D the slide read, using a term for the traditional internet not protected by Tor.\nHad AlphaBay made this mistake? Rumker sounded very much like the secret weapon that had pinpointed that dark-web giant's IP address, and likely those of many other targets too.\n(When I wrote to Chainalysis' Michael Gronager to ask about the slides and specifically about Rumker, he didn't deny the presentation's legitimacy. Instead, he sent me a statement that read like a kind of summation of his stance on Bitcoin's privacy, which he argues is virtually nonexistent: \u201COpen protocols are openly monitored\u2014to keep the space safe\u2014and to enable a permission-less value transfer network to flourish.\u201D)\nRumker, if it was in fact the tool that located AlphaBay, had likely just been \u201Cburned.\u201D Whoever leaked it had, in doing so, exposed the vulnerabilities of the Bitcoin protocol it exploits. Dark-web administrators like DeSnake will no doubt take more care in the future to prevent their cryptocurrency wallets from revealing their IP addresses to snooping Bitcoin nodes.\nBut there will be other vulnerabilities, and other secret weapons to exploit them. The cat-and-mouse game continues. And for every Alpha that's taken down, another will be waiting in the dark web's manifold shadows, ready to rise into their place.\nThis story is excerpted from Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available now from Doubleday. \nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

You went to Blackwater Pond?\nLauren Goode: I was. I was actually there. But no, I guess if I'm being truthful, as a journalist and as a professional keeper of the historical record, I probably should download my archive. Have you done it yet?\nMichael Calore: Not in years, no.\nLauren Goode: Have you deleted all of your super secret DMs on Twitter?\nMichael Calore: I've deleted some of them, but I'm not sure that I actually deleted them.\nLauren Goode: OK. We need to talk about this.\n[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]\nMichael Calore: Let's do it. Hi, everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I am Michael Calore. I'm a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: We are also joined by WIRED security writer Lily Hay Newman. Hi, Lily. Welcome back.\nLily Hay Newman: Hello. Thanks for having me.\nMichael Calore: As always, it's a pleasure to have you here. So look, we know we've been talking about Twitter a lot on the show recently, and sure, we are journalists and journalists are obsessed with Twitter. But for today's show, we want to talk about Twitter one more time but specifically because Twitter is currently suffering some security issues that have wide implications. Since the new boss over there, Elon Musk, laid off roughly 3,700 employees two weeks ago, many people have been keeping close watch over Twitter to see what kind of chaos might erupt. Security professionals and data privacy wonks are watching, and they're probably sighing a lot, but hackers and attackers and scammers are circling the platform as well. Lily, it is always fun to have you on the show, even if when you're here we always end up talking about these doom and havoc situations. But I guess the first question about the security situation at Twitter we have to ask you is this, what is going on inside the company that we know? With the recent layoffs and resignations, how stretched is Twitter's security staff?\nLily Hay Newman: Yes. This is an important question, and there isn't a ton that we know super specifically, but first of all, half of the workforce was laid off. We just know that broadly. We know that Elon Musk currently is actually encouraging even more people to leave if they're not willing to commit to a super intense, work-all-the-time approach. They have until today, I believe, Thursday, to consent to Mega Death Twitter or something. We've also seen Musk conduct public firings via tweets, just in recent days. And two and a half weeks ago or so, at the beginning of this whole regime change, we saw Musk broadly fire many executives of the company or have them step down, including some who work on privacy and trust and identity issues within the company. So just all of that paints a picture of an internal situation where there just aren't probably going to be enough warm bodies to do everything that was happening a month ago. For security, that's always a big issue because security is all about monitoring, it's all about constant vigilance, always improving, always investing more. So this is just a climate that is not going to be conducive to strong cybersecurity defenses broadly.Lauren Goode: So we know there have been a lot of layoffs. We know that in the missive he sent out earlier this week where he said \"If you're not hardcore, don't bother working here\" he also said that engineering would be the primary focus, with design and product management taking a backseat. Within that engineering structure, we just don't know how many people are going to be focused specifically on security. Is that correct?\nLily Hay Newman: Right. Certainly, I don't, at least, have a sense in the new world order of anything about team structures or things like that\u2014of how many resources and how many people are going to be dedicated to those things. Keep in mind that IT is also a highly intersecting department with security in any organization, and things can be structured differently at different places. But just running an organization's devices and servers correctly is a security issue inherently.\nMichael Calore: Speaking of that, we've already seen some things break down from the outside, right? Earlier this week, there was an issue with the SMS two-factor authentication system on Twitter.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. I did a story about how users were reporting that they couldn't receive authentication codes for logging in or for things like downloading their Twitter archive. They couldn't receive those codes via SMS, and when we tested it internally at WIRED, not everyone was having the problem, but some of us were. In one case, someone received a code on a delay\u2014they got the SMS text message many hours later, which was strange. The Twitter comms department is currently either nonexistent or much reduced, so there isn't a good way to get official comment right now about these types of things. So we don't even have a clear sense of how those texts get sent or used to be sent\u2014or is it an integration with a third-party service, as is often the case, where another company will provide the SMS infrastructure? Or is it something Twitter does in-house? Who knows? I also took one for the team, meaning all of you listeners and WIRED readers out there, and tweeted at Musk directly to ask him\u2014\nLauren Goode: I was going to ask if you had done this yet. OK.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. I am clearly still on the podcast to tell the tale. So I'm doing all right, thanks for checking in, but I didn't get a reply because there's just so many pressing issues for him to tweet about right now.\nLauren Goode: Are you telling us that Elon has not yet fired you from WIRED? He does not yet have the ability to do that?\nLily Hay Newman: Someone did note that perhaps I would cause a real problem by causing him to acquire WIRED just so he could fire me. So hopefully, that does not happen.\nLauren Goode: In all the futures I've envisioned for WIRED, I have to say being owned by Elon Musk was not one of them.Michael Calore: Oh, I've had that dream.\nLauren Goode: Is it a nightmare or a dream?\nMichael Calore: Well, no comment.\nLauren Goode: If Musk sent out a missive to the WIRED folks right now and is like, \"Are you hardcore or are you not?\" What would you do?\nMichael Calore: I would take the severance.\nLauren Goode: OK. Fair enough.\nMichael Calore: I talked to my union rep.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Oh, there you go. Well played. Well played. OK. So we have seen a breakdown in SMS two-factor authentication. We've also seen some big entities affected by this new verification scheme, which keeps changing because some people have been creating fake accounts but getting blue checks, which make them look valid or legit. And then they're tweeting things that are affecting, say, the share price of giant pharmaceutical companies. What's the worst-case scenario for a really, really major security meltdown though, rather than a verification meltdown? Are all of our DMs exposed? Is our personal and private info used to hack us across other websites? Is there a heightened conflict across nation states? What's really the worst-case scenario here?\nLily Hay Newman: There are a few things that I think we should talk about. Certainly, one of them is a massive data breach. The data that Twitter holds, they don't have social security numbers or government identification information. They don't have health records broadly. They don't have financial data broadly, though people who signed up for Twitter Blue, I guess, needed to provide a credit card to do that, so they have those numbers. But they still have a lot of information about all their users. So as you said, the contents of direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted and are therefore accessible and could be compromised in a data breach. They have phone numbers, email addresses, things like that. And then also, the social graph of who has communicated with whom over the years and who people associate with, that type of information can be really sensitive and is a privacy issue, especially for users who are activists, journalists, dissidents, and operate in countries under repressive regimes. There can be very real safety issues to having social media data out publicly. But then also, as always, identity theft, harassment, any personal details that cybercriminals can get about people can fuel digital crime and scams, so all the data that would be in a massive Twitter breach has implications in that sense. But then there's a lot of other types of things to think about if we really want to get into worst-case scenario, and we're not saying that this has happened or there's evidence that this is happening. But if we view Twitter as being very much in chaos or in crisis and that we're just thinking here about things that could emerge out of that, the Twitter app is a trusted app on users' phones if they've downloaded it. A rogue entity that compromises Twitter's infrastructure could, at least for a brief period, potentially weaponize the Twitter app to do bad things. As you said, verification gets into these questions about account takeovers. That's already been a problem for Twitter in the past. So I think it's just conceptually the idea that there's both the data and there's the trusted infrastructure, and either could be compromised. What's interesting about doing this thought experiment is that this isn't just true of Twitter, this is true of any entity that has centralized a lot of our data and where we trust their software on our devices, things like that. This type of digital infrastructure can be weaponized. It's not uniquely a Twitter thing.Michael Calore: All right. Well, let's take a break and we'll come right back.\nLauren Goode: On that uplifting note.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right. Lily, as you've mentioned, Twitter is in this vulnerable position right now. So as users of Twitter, how worried should we be about our accounts getting taken over or getting locked out or our DMs being exposed?\nLily Hay Newman: Well, I really don't want to flip anyone out because there's no special knowledge here, we're all just hanging out, chatting. I don't know that there is a totally looming, tomorrow-type threat, but I think the big concern and the reason we're doing this thought experiment is, again, the chaos and confusion of this moment within the company definitely has the potential to create even more vulnerability and expose things even more.\nLauren Goode: So I'm really curious about DMs, in particular. When you go to delete a DM on Twitter, you get a pretty clear message that says it's been deleted for you but it hasn't been deleted for the person or people on the other end of that message thread. Twitter also notoriously doesn't have end-to-end encrypted messaging. It seems like it's pretty insecure as far as those things go. Lily, how exactly does that work? Is there any way to actually delete your Twitter DMs?\nLily Hay Newman: So it's a very good question. I do not know the answer, and I don't think the answer is really known, partly because of the comms department breakdown in this current moment, but partly, it's been unclear for a long time. I think people have been asking this for a long time. I also have been trying to ask Twitter about this for a while. Your best shot is to get yourself and the other party or parties that were in the chat to all delete the messages in question so it's deleted on all the ends, as we call it. Whether or not that actually results in Twitter on its own servers permanently deleting the data after a period of time we just don't know, and I don't think anyone has been able to find out.\nLauren Goode: Mm-hmm.\nMichael Calore: Right.\nLauren Goode: That's incredibly reassuring. Yeah. I think 70 percent of my DMs are probably, \"Hi! It was really nice to meet you at fill-in-the-blank conference. Let's stay in touch,\" and then that was seven years ago.\nMichael Calore: And they never wrote back.\nLauren Goode: Or they did and then we were like, \"Yeah. Let's stay in touch,\" and then maybe, I don't know, you see them in another conference three years later. I don't think I have a lot of stuff in DMs, but Elon Musk owns our DMs now, folks.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It is sobering to think about. I know that when you delete your account, when you say, \"I would like to not have a Twitter account anymore\" and you delete everything, if you don't log in for 30 days, the company says that it's going to erase all of your information, which includes your DMs, all your tweets, all your profile information, all your location information, and your social graph, like who your friends were on Twitter. But that's what they say, we don't really know what their actual data retention practices are. We just know what their data retention policies are.Lauren Goode: Oh, that's interesting.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. That's a really important thing to point out because Twitter's policy on account deactivation says, \"If you do not log back into your account for the 30 days following the deactivation, your account will be permanently deactivated. Once permanently deactivated, all information associated with your account is no longer available in our production tools.\"\nLauren Goode: What does that mean?\nLily Hay Newman: So the word delete never once is there.\nMichael Calore: Right.\nLauren Goode: It's no longer available\u2014\nMichael Calore: In our production tools.\nLauren Goode: Wow. I'm going to say that next time I delete somebody's number, \"They are no longer available in my contact tools.\"\nLily Hay Newman: In my production tool. Someone also pointed out to me that 30 days is actually not enough time to comply with all the data retention requirements that companies like Twitter would be under. They're not required to keep data forever, but Twitter may have data retention obligations that go beyond 30 days, which would also make that whole thing confusing or indicate that deactivation is not the same as deletion.\nLauren Goode: Separate but related to my question about deleting DMs. In the past, both Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk have talked about creating some kind of end-to-end encryption messaging system for Twitter, what's the status of that?\nLily Hay Newman: Yes. I don't know the current status of that.\nLauren Goode: Once again, Elon has not responded to your tweet.\nLily Hay Newman: Right. Though to be fair, I did not specifically tweet at him about that in the recent past. But yeah, I mean, people have said for a while that it might be coming. I support it any time. It's great. I think as many apps and services as possible as can roll out end-to-end encryption should. It feels to me like right now would not be the moment when Twitter could actually deploy that even if there's already been a bunch of work on it. But like I said, would love to be wrong and for them to release it at any time, it is possible. It's just like Twitter, in this moment of crisis, probably wouldn't be trusted as much.\nMichael Calore: So for the people with their finger on the pulse of what's going on at Twitter, a lot of them are just adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Some people are leaving, they're going to Mastodon. Most Twitter users are just continuing to use Twitter as normal, which is to be expected and is fine. It's what happens whenever there's big upheaval. Political intrigue inside of a company doesn't necessarily trickle down to everybody who is a customer of that company. But what are you doing, Lily? Are you panicking? Are you leaving? Are you hanging out to watch what happens?\nLily Hay Newman: When you said finger on the pulse, I thought you were going to say finger on the trigger. OK. Yes, I have not left Twitter. So my first thought is that I haven't changed a ton about how I'm using Twitter yet. Definitely, don't leak things that are damaging to Elon Musk to journalists on Twitter DM. Do leak things that are going to be illustrative of what's going on inside the company to journalists on more secure platforms, such as Signal, but don't create new problems for yourself. What's done is done. What you were DMing about that's embarrassing in 2013 or whatever, it is what it is, but I would be extra vigilant now about not generating new privacy issues for yourself in Twitter DMs or private tweets and things like that. Personally, I would not have signed up for Twitter Blue in recent weeks, or in the past week, whenever that briefly happened. First of all, because I personally didn't want to or see benefits doing it, but second, because I wouldn't have wanted to provide more data to Twitter in order to do it, so that's one thing. Something I haven't personally done but that you could do if you want to be more paranoid or more aggressive about insulating yourself from risk of potential fallout would be to delete the app from your phone and only use Twitter in a web browser, which would potentially mitigate or would mitigate that potential rogue app situation. But as I said, I haven't done that yet. I'm not necessarily saying you should, just trying to give people some ideas about the parameters of how to think about these things.Michael Calore: That's great advice. Thanks.\nLauren Goode: Your productivity will shoot through the roof too, not having Twitter on your phone.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. Benefits all around.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nLily Hay Newman: I don't know. What are you both thinking? Has it been bugging you?\nLauren Goode: I mean, I've been on Twitter since 2009, I think? Maybe 2008. And so I do have a long history on Twitter, but I don't really feel like going through all of my old DMs and figuring out what's what. It seems like there should be an opportunity to batch-delete your DMs but maintain other elements of your Twitter account or go through and delete all the media you've ever attached to tweets in case there's metadata baked into the media but not delete other things, but you can't. It's like you have to either just delete Twitter or live with it.\nMichael Calore: You should submit that request to the features team and see how long it takes for them to implement it.\nLauren Goode: That's great. Do you have their email?\nLily Hay Newman: I was going to say, meanwhile, we don't even know if we can delete any data off of Twitter at all.\nLauren Goode: Right. So it just feels like a moot point. It feels like there's a lot of onus being put on the user right now for what is becoming an increasingly user-hostile experience.\nMichael Calore: Right.\nLauren Goode: What are your thoughts, Mike?\nMichael Calore: I'm going to wait and see if the time comes when it feels like the right thing to do is to delete everything and bail, I will have no problems doing that.\nLauren Goode: When the time comes to let it go, let it go.\nMichael Calore: Let it go. Life is too short to worry about a Twitter account, that's what I always say.\nLauren Goode: It is.\nMichael Calore: Always. I say that all the time.\nLily Hay Newman: I've heard you say it.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, Lily, thanks to this invigorating conversation about where this is all headed. Even if we don't have a lot of detail, it was great to get some good advice, so thanks.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah. I'm always happy to spread the joy.\nMichael Calore: Let's take a break, and when we come back, we'll do our recommendations.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: All right. Lily, you are our guest, so you get to go first. What is your recommendation for the people?\nLily Hay Newman: My recommendation this week is a type of protein bar. It's called Wicked protein bar and\u2014\nLauren Goode: Is it from Massachusetts?\nLily Hay Newman: I don't know. I've only tried one flavor, and I'm recommending that flavor, but I can't speak to any of the other flavors, so maybe this is of limited use. But the flavor I want to recommend is maple, and my reason for recommending this is that, I don't know if anyone else feels this way, it's very hard to find a protein bar that's low sugar, has a good amount of protein, doesn't taste gross but also that I actively like and can eat again and again. Do you all know what I'm talking about?Michael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nLily Hay Newman: I usually ... I'll eat a protein bar, and I'm like, \"Yeah. Oh, OK. Great. This is good,\" and then I go to eat it again, and I'm like, \"No, I'm sick of it. I don't want another one.\"\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Or you eat one and you just think like, \"OK, that was sustenance. Now, I can live for another hour.\"\nLily Hay Newman: Even the Wicked maple protein bars, that's pretty much all we're getting to. I wouldn't say it's a favorite food, but I can eat them multiple times in whatever, a month or a week or whatever it is, and get through it and not be just like, I don't know, throwing it out or so fed up with myself for placing myself in the situation. But similar to the last time I was on the show, when I recommended a type of N95 mask and provided the disclosure that the masks are very unattractive, I do feel the need to provide a disclosure this time that other people who have tried the protein bars did not like them. So when I've given them to friends or been like, \"Oh yeah, these protein bars are so good.\" They said they thought the flavor was gross and they don't understand \u2026 because it's not sweet, that's the thing. I don't like when protein bars are super sweet so\u2014\nMichael Calore: Neither do I.\nLily Hay Newman: This is what you get when you have me on the show. My recommendations are a real mixed bag, but for my palate, Wicked Protein Bars in maple, 15 grams of protein, 2 grams of sugar, and I'm seeing here, it says, \"Certified clean.\"\nMichael Calore: Well, that's something I always look for in foods that I'm eating.\nLily Hay Newman: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Certified clean? What? Like it's PG? I don't know.\nLily Hay Newman: Right, exactly. I need a G rating for my protein bars. Anyway, that's my recommendation.\nLauren Goode: That's a pretty good one.\nMichael Calore: That sounds both delicious and nutritious. Thank you for the recommendation. Lauren, what is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: I just have to say, while Lily was giving her excellent recommendation, I was going through my Twitter inbox and I went all the way back to my very first DM on Twitter. My very first DMs were in 2009, June 2009, and it was just a series of people saying, \"Hey, thanks for the follow,\" like there's a\u2014\nMichael Calore: Old school.\nLauren Goode: It's what people did then. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Old school.\nLauren Goode: There's someone with the handle @citizenfreepress and it's, \"Thanks for the follow.\" And then, @runnersworld, which I followed, \"Thanks for the follow.\" That's it. That's it, that's the excitement.\nMichael Calore: OK, Lauren. What is your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation this week is Andy Greenberg's new book, Tracers in the Dark. Andy is a colleague of ours. He works closely with Lily on our security desk, and I have to admit, I have not yet read Andy's book. It just came out, and I'm hoping that we will have the opportunity to have Andy on the show at some point to talk about it because he's doing the press circuit for it now. But his book, Tracers in the Dark, is about the investigators chasing criminals through the very dark crypto underworld. He interviews prosecutors, industry analysts, even some criminals themselves. He writes about how there are these clues in the pseudo-anonymous, decentralized blockchain that are tipping off investigators to these crimes, and it has a lot of bigger implications, I think, for our concepts of privacy and anonymity on the web. Andy is just a really powerful, masterful writer and excellent reporter. And so I look forward to reading it, but I recommend it for everyone else right now, Tracers in the Dark.Michael Calore: Nice.\nLily Hay Newman: Since you were scrolling during my recommendation, I was reading during your recommendation. No, I'm just kidding, but I have read Tracers in the Dark so I just want to provide a testimonial, a reader testimonial, that it is really great and it is not ... If you are super into investing and the business of cryptocurrency or something, it's not about that. But for me, that was a big plus, like what I really wanted to learn about was the technology that underlies the blockchain and why there was this misconception that particularly Bitcoin transactions are untraceable. Why did people think that? Why did criminals think that? And why is it untrue? How can you trace these transactions? That has meant a lot of good things for law enforcement in terms of their ability to track cyber criminals, which Andy details in the book, but he also talks about the potential privacy implications of being able to trace transactions and historically back through time because the blockchain is this indelible record of everything that's ever happened. So yeah, just wanted to piggyback on just a quick reader recommendation.\nLauren Goode: Thanks, Lily. That's awesome.\nMichael Calore: I think curious readers can also check out an excerpt of Andy's book that is currently running on WIRED.com. I think it's a four-part excerpt?\nLauren Goode: Oh, that's exciting.\nLily Hay Newman: It's so many parts, and it's so good and so exciting. So it'll be in the show notes, right?\nMichael Calore: Yes, it will.\nLauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation this week?\nMichael Calore: My recommendation is a Netflix show called The Sandman, and it is an adaptation of a comic book from the late '80s\/early '90s written by Neil Gaiman. A very famous comic book. It is a really well-done comic book adaptation, and if you know me at all, then you know that's not something I say that often, but it's a great show. I'm really enjoying it. My wife is really enjoying it. It's a story of these folks who are immortals and they live in the sort of ether realm in and out of reality, and one of them gets trapped by this person who's an occultist who casts spells to try and trap immortals and is held hostage for 100 years and then escapes and has to reclaim all of the things that he lost, that were stolen from him, that were raided from him. And that sets him off on this series of adventures. I don't want to say anything more than that. I don't want to give it away. But it is fun, it's very emo, it's very dark, it's very adult, all the things that you want from a good comic book adaptation on Netflix. So that's my recommendation, The Sandman.\nLauren Goode: Who stars in it?\nMichael Calore: Nobody that you know. It's all British people. Although I will say, David Thewlis is in it. David Thewlis, the famous actor? Yeah, you're shaking your head no. You'll recognize him if you see him.Lauren Goode: OK.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. He's a dramatist, a really great actor, and he's quite good in this. He plays a villain.\nLauren Goode: So the protagonist is the Sandman?\nMichael Calore: Yeah. He's an anti-hero because he's somebody who's not really nice to people. He's kind of a jerk, but he has a crow, and his crow is funny. I think Patton Oswalt does the voice of the crow, so there are two famous people in it.\nLauren Goode: Nice.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Anyway, that's my rec. It's a good one.\nLauren Goode: Thank you for that.\nMichael Calore: Thank you, Lily, for joining us.\nLily Hay Newman: Thank you so much for having me. I just scrolled back in my Twitter DMs, and it looks like my first one ever is from The Baltimore Sun welcoming me to Twitter.\nMichael Calore: Wow.\nLauren Goode: Oh. Those were the days.\nMichael Calore: Wow, The Baltimore Sun. Did David Simon send it?\nLily Hay Newman: I hope so. Probably not, but I was living in Baltimore at the time, so I guess that's the tie-in. But yes, thank you for having me. And everyone, stay safe out there.\nMichael Calore: Thank you all for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on Twitter, still. Just check the show notes. Our producer is Boone Ashworth. We'll be back next week. Goodbye.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/63759c9007aaf5e4eb27d0a6\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Twitter_sec_GettyImages-1244419524.jpg","author":"BY WIRED STAFF","title":"What Happens If Twitter Gets Hacked?","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/gadget-lab-podcast-575\/","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","TWITTER","ELON MUSK","SECURITY"]},{"date":"11.15.2022","summary":"The team uses a secret technique to locate AlphaBay\u2019s server. But just as the operation heats up, the agents have an unexpected run-in with their target.","post_content":"CHAPTER 8\nTAKEOVER\nIN JUNE 2017, a team of Royal Thai Police officers arrived at the Courtyard Marriott in Sacramento, California. Jen Sanchez, a veteran Drug Enforcement Administration agent, had been assigned to bring the delegation on a flight from Bangkok to California to coordinate with the US team\u2014to iron out any intercontinental wrinkles on the Bangkok end of what had come to be known as Operation Bayonet.\nThe Thai cops met the American agents, analysts, and prosecutors at the US attorney\u2019s office, with more than two dozen people arrayed around the room. The two countries traded PowerPoint briefings. Ali and Erin, expert cryptocurrency-tracing FBI analysts from Washington, DC, walked the Thais through a \u201CBitcoin 101\u201D presentation and detailed how they had tracked Cazes\u2019 hidden cash flows. The Thais shared everything they\u2019d learned from following Cazes\u2019 physical movements for months. The police then explained the particulars of the Thai legal system\u2014what US agents would and wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do with Cazes after, if all went well, they laid hands on him.\nBetween meetings, Sanchez took the Thai group on field trips: to a golfing range, to a shopping mall\u2014where the officers descended ravenously on a Coach outlet\u2014and on an outing to San Francisco in rented vans. The Thais, accustomed to the tropics, nearly froze on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf; they were so jet-lagged and exhausted from their sightseeing frenzy that they slept through the drive over the Golden Gate Bridge in both directions. On another day, the FBI gave the Thais a tour of the explosives lab at the bureau\u2019s Sacramento field office, showing off the agency\u2019s bomb-defusing robots. Paul Hemesath, the prosecutor, later brought out his HTC Vive VR headset, and the two countries\u2019 agents took turns walking a plank over a digital abyss and swinging virtual swords at zombies.\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nWhen they weren\u2019t busy with tourism and team-building exercises, the agents were grappling with the practical details of raiding a dark-web kingpin. At one point, the case\u2019s lead FBI agent presented the looming problem of Cazes\u2019 laptop encryption. Sanchez and the Thais explained that based on their surveillance, Cazes almost never opened his machine outside his own home. The agents agreed: They\u2019d have to catch him in his house, logged in to AlphaBay and yet somehow off guard so that he wouldn\u2019t shut the laptop before his arrest.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nA Timeline of Russian Cyberattacks on Ukraine\nAlmost as important as the computer was Cazes\u2019 iPhone. The FBI told the Thais they\u2019d need to grab it unlocked, or it too would be irretrievably encrypted. That phone, after all, might hold keys to Cazes\u2019 cryptocurrency wallets or other crucial data. The question of how to thread the needle of capturing these two devices and their information hung in the air, unanswered.\nThen Sanchez spoke: She asked the lead FBI agent if it would be helpful to know more about how Cazes spent his days, hour by hour. After all, she explained, he had laid it all out on Roosh V, the online forum for \u201Calpha males\u201D where Cazes practically liveblogged his daily life and sexual escapades under the handle Rawmeo. The FBI agent invited her to go ahead.\nSo Sanchez walked the group through Cazes\u2019 daily schedule as he had, himself, described it in exacting detail: Wake up at dawn and check his email and social media, including the Roosh V forum. Work out at home until the late morning. Have sex with his wife. Then go to his laptop and take care of business until the evening, with only a short break in the afternoon for a light lunch. At seven, he\u2019d quit work for the day to go out for dinner and cruise for girls in his Lamborghini Aventador. Almost without fail he\u2019d be back home and asleep by 11.Then Sanchez offered another observation from her Roosh V trawling: She could see on the forum exactly when Cazes was online. The little green light next to Rawmeo\u2019s name wasn\u2019t merely a reminder that they were seeing into Cazes\u2019 thoughts in real time. It might also serve as an indicator of when his laptop was open\u2014and when Alpha02 was vulnerable.\nJUST DAYS LATER, on the morning of June 20, 2017, in the small central Netherlands city of Driebergen, half a dozen Dutch police officers were huddled around a conference room where they\u2019d been anxiously waiting since early that day. Finally, one of the investigators\u2019 phones rang with a call from the German Federal Police. The Germans had just arrested the two administrators of Hansa, the dark web\u2019s second-biggest black market for drugs, in their homes. Both men were in custody. The first phase of Operation Bayonet\u2019s one-two punch\u2014an unprecedented attempt to take down one market while secretly taking over another\u2014could now begin.\nFor weeks, the Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit had been preparing for this moment. They\u2019d used the source code for Hansa that they\u2019d pulled from the German servers to reconstruct their own, offline, practice version of the market, to familiarize themselves with how it was built and administered. They\u2019d even gone so far as to create their own play-money version of Bitcoin, with its very own blockchain\u2014what cryptocurrency developers call a testnet\u2014to privately experiment with how the site handled its monetary transactions.\nNow, with the real admins arrested, they had to take over and run the actual, live version of Hansa, with millions of dollars moving between tens of thousands of users. And they had to do it seamlessly, without knocking the site offline or, worse, giving its users or staff any clue that the two administrators had been replaced by a team of undercover Dutch police.\nAt the Germans\u2019 signal, the Dutch team immediately called a pair of agents they\u2019d sent to a data center in Lithuania, where the server actively running Hansa was hosted. Those agents physically pulled out a hard drive from the rack that held the machine so they could access a backup copy of its data. The teams in Driebergen and Lithuania then began feverishly duplicating every digital component of the market, piece by piece, on their own computers and then on a server in a Netherlands data center, reconstructing an exact copy of the site that was now under their control.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay companion newsletter. \nFor the next two days, the Dutch investigators sat at their keyboards from morning until well after midnight, fueled by pizza and Red Bull. At one point early on, someone spilled a soda onto the conference table, nearly soaking a laptop that stored the entire collection of the Hansa data; only a desperate lunge by one of the investigators managed to save it. At another point, a typo in a single command caused the site to go down for several panicky minutes before it could be restored.\nAround 3 am on the third night after the arrests, a Dutch investigator, Marinus Boekelo, was troubleshooting another bug that was causing error messages to cascade across the screen whenever someone used the search bar at the top of the page. \u201CFuck, fuck, fuck!\u201D Boekelo muttered, bent over his laptop, his hands on either side of his face as he attempted one fix after another.Then, after a moment, he leaned back with a look of relief. The error messages were gone. The last serious bug had been ironed out.\nAfter nearly 72 hours, they had the reconstructed site running smoothly, fully under their command. The skeleton crew still working in the conference room exploded with jubilation. Aside from the one brief period of downtime, the migration of the site to a Dutch data center had been nearly invisible to its users.\nThe most conspicuous sign of the takeover, the Dutch police worried, was that for almost three days there had been complete radio silence from the two Hansa administrators. The site\u2019s staff of four moderators looked to the two admins for orders and to resolve any disputes between buyers and dealers that they couldn\u2019t handle themselves. The police could see that the admins communicated with Hansa\u2019s staff using an encrypted messaging system called Tox Chat\u2014the server they\u2019d seized contained some limited logs of their past communications\u2014but they didn\u2019t have the password to log in to their chat accounts.\nSo they tried a simple solution: They asked the real admins for help. The two German men quickly agreed to cooperate in hopes of a lighter sentence. They handed over their Tox Chat passwords to the German police, who passed them on to the Dutch. The team in Driebergen then resumed day-to-day chatter between the bustling black market\u2019s bosses and staff. With the cooperation of the real admins and their Tox Chat logs, they were able to pick up the business of the site without a hitch. Their only initial error was paying one moderator the incorrect amount for his Bitcoin salary, pegged to the wrong non-digital currency. The undercover police fixed their mistake, paid the staffer the difference, and all was forgiven.\nThe Dutch team had come up with a cover story for the admins\u2019 three days offline: They\u2019d tell anyone who asked that they were heads-down, coding an upgrade to the market. But no one asked. The hierarchy of the marketplace\u2019s org chart and the secrecy of dark-web operations, where no one on staff knew their coworkers beyond a username and a shared chat history, meant the cops in admin clothing were spared any curious questions about their absence.\nNor, they were relieved to discover, did there seem to be any inside jokes or watercooler gossip to catch up on. \u201CIt actually turned out that they did not discuss anything personal with each other,\u201D one investigator remembers. \u201CIt was pure business.\u201D\nThe cover story about an upgrade wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. In reconstructing the site, the Dutch police had actually ironed out some of its bugs and rewritten parts of its code to be more efficient. And because they now had a team of half a dozen rotating agents acting as the administrators, instead of two overworked individuals, they found that the site\u2019s customers considered the day-to-day operations of the market to be significantly improved.\nOne of the younger Dutch agents had been an IT help-desk admin years earlier. He found his new job helping run Hansa to be remarkably similar. He got to work efficiently resolving disputes over the site\u2019s drug deals, assisted by a collection of answers the administrators had helpfully prepared in an online control panel. The undercover agent even came to the rescue of one grateful, sight-impaired drug dealer, helping him figure out how to get his screen reader software properly integrated with his Tor browser.Ethical quandaries aside, the team couldn\u2019t help but take pride in the professionalism of their work. \u201CThe quality really went up,\u201D said Gert Ras, the head of the Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit. \u201CEveryone was very satisfied with the level of service they got.\u201D\nFOR THEIR FIRST day acting as Hansa\u2019s bosses, the team had cautiously watched the site\u2019s internal clockwork, barely believing that they\u2019d gotten away with their takeover. But when it became clear they could control Hansa seemingly indefinitely, they settled in, working in shifts to run the site 24\/7 from the small conference room in Driebergen.\nOn one wall, they set up a 65-inch screen where someone started a stopwatch, measuring exactly how long they\u2019d been in control of the market. Then slowly, silently, they began to spring the trap they\u2019d assembled.\nHansa, like any good dark-web market, had been designed to learn as little as possible about its users beyond what was necessary to facilitate reliable drug transactions. The passwords for users\u2019 accounts were stored only as cryptographic \u201Chashes,\u201D indecipherable strings of characters that let the site avoid having to protect a collection of those sensitive login credentials. Hansa also offered to let users automatically encrypt all their messages using the privacy program PGP\u2014including, most importantly, the mailing addresses buyers would share with sellers when they made an order. All of this meant that, in theory, the site itself would never have full access to its users\u2019 accounts or know their most personal data, such as the location of their homes.\nNow the police began to invisibly sabotage those safeguards. They started recording all of Hansa\u2019s usernames and passwords when buyers and sellers logged in. They also began secretly archiving the full text of every message that users sent on the site before the text was encrypted. Soon they were collecting hundreds, then thousands, of buyers\u2019 addresses from orders, turning the business of the entire market into a glass aquarium under their real-time surveillance.\nAccording to Dutch law, the police had to record and attempt to intercept every drug order made on the market while they controlled it. So the half-dozen undercover agents in their small conference room were soon joined by dozens of others, working on the same floor, who were tasked with manually cataloging every single purchase. They forwarded the data from sales destined for the Netherlands to Dutch police, who could seize the packages of heroin, cocaine, and meth shipped through domestic mail. Non-Dutch orders would be sent to Europol, which was charged with distributing the ever-growing pile of drug-deal data to their respective nations\u2019 law enforcement agencies.\nAlready, the Dutch police had accomplished something law enforcement had never attempted before: hunting, capturing, and vivisecting a dark-web drug market in real time, unbeknownst to the site\u2019s users. But Operation Bayonet was only getting started. The Dutch\u2014and their collaborators from Sacramento to Bangkok\u2014had other, bigger game in their crosshairs.\nCHAPTER 9\n\u2018Advanced Analysis\u2019\nON JUNE 22, 2017, two days after the Hansa takeover and less than two weeks before the date of the planned AlphaBay takedown, Michael Gronager and Jonathan Levin, cofounders of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency tracing firm, Chainalysis, happened to be in the Netherlands. So was an Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations agent named Tigran Gambaryan. They had all flown to The Hague, halfway across the small country from the Driebergen office where the Dutch were pulling Hansa\u2019s puppet strings, for a Europol conference focused on virtual currency investigations.\nAs contractors with no security clearance, Levin and Gronager were unaware of what Gambaryan knew: that by this time, all the interlocking pieces of Operation Bayonet were falling into place. The Dutch Hansa takeover was underway. A team of Americans targeting AlphaBay planned to set up surveillance of that market\u2019s Dutch servers early on July 5, taking a snapshot of its contents while Cazes was logged in to it. They would pull it offline only after the Thais arrested Cazes in Bangkok; touching it any sooner might spook him and cause him to destroy evidence or flee. US prosecutors would then interrogate Cazes and swiftly extradite him. Even the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been roped in to simultaneously search Cazes\u2019 mother\u2019s home in Quebec.Gambaryan was only on the periphery of this international whirlwind of detective work. A compact former forensic accountant with a gruff demeanor, he had gained a reputation as a highly capable dark-web investigator and the IRS\u2019s top Bitcoin whisperer. A few years earlier, he\u2019d pioneered the first real cryptocurrency-tracing criminal case, following Bitcoin trails to prove that two federal agents assigned to investigate the Silk Road dark-web market had in fact pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of the market\u2019s bitcoins through theft, extortion, and sales of insider information.\nGambaryan worked as part of IRS Criminal Investigations\u2019 cybercrime unit in DC, but he had learned about the AlphaBay case early on from a friendly IRS agent in Fresno, California, his hometown, where he often went to visit his parents. He\u2019d followed the investigation\u2019s progress, but he\u2019d never been assigned to the case.\nStill, he couldn\u2019t help but take an occasional, curious poke at the biggest dark-web market in history. For months, Gambaryan had followed AlphaBay\u2019s tracks through the blockchain, obsessively pestering Chainalysis\u2019 Jonathan Levin with new ideas about how to circumscribe the edges of the AlphaBay \u201Ccluster\u201D\u2014the millions of Bitcoin addresses the site and its users had generated\u2014or trace its most incriminating money trails. He was, as Levin put it, \u201Ccompletely relentless.\u201D\nThat spring, Gambaryan and Levin had together come up with an idea\u2014a new, experimental method to examine AlphaBay\u2019s use of cryptocurrency. Prosecutors in the AlphaBay case have referred to it using only the hideously vague term \u201Cadvanced analysis.\u201D But Gambaryan and Levin hoped they could use it to unearth a major finding: the IP address of the server that hosted AlphaBay\u2019s Bitcoin wallet. With that IP in hand, they should be able to pinpoint the server\u2019s physical location and seize it, gaining key evidence in their case against Cazes and assuring that no one else on AlphaBay\u2019s staff would be able to take control of the site after Cazes\u2019 arrest.\nBy all conventional wisdom, it shouldn\u2019t have been possible to learn that IP address through blockchain surveillance. The blockchain, after all, is a ledger of transactions between Bitcoin addresses. It doesn\u2019t record IP addresses, the strings of numbers that identify individual computers on the internet and can often help investigators locate them. But Levin and Gambaryan\u2019s method could somehow obtain those identifiers. Neither has revealed a word of how this technique works. In fact, in our conversations, they never treated any piece of cryptocurrency-tracing tradecraft with more secrecy.\nUnbeknownst to Levin, by the spring of 2017 the Operation Bayonet team believed they already knew an AlphaBay IP address: the one in the Netherlands that had once been leaked in the welcome email for the site\u2019s forums and then in November 2016 passed on by a tipster to Fresno DEA agent Robert Miller. But Gambaryan figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to independently verify this critical piece of evidence. Levin had been doing his own hands-on research into AlphaBay for years, and he was eager to try out a new investigative technique that Chainalysis could potentially sell to other customers.On that June morning in The Hague, Levin sat at a desk in an apartment in the coastal city\u2019s quiet western periphery, a few blocks from the beach, next to a fishing harbor that fed into the wind-churned North Sea. Levin and Gronager had rented the Airbnb and were sharing it\u2014more out of habit than financial necessity, given Chainalysis\u2019 recent multimillion-dollar funding rounds and swelling cash flow\u2014with one staying in the bedroom and the other on the couch.\nLevin and Gronager were both up early, before the Europol conference began. So Levin used this spare moment to check the results of his and Gambaryan\u2019s advanced analysis experiment.\nThe answer appeared, without fanfare, on Levin\u2019s screen: an AlphaBay IP address. Or rather, a handful of IP addresses that were likely to belong to the site\u2019s wallet server. A quick search revealed that the likeliest of them wasn\u2019t, in fact, in the Netherlands, but in a data center in Lithuania.\nLevin remembers his reaction in the moment as less of an epiphany than a brief flash of recognition. \u201CHuh,\u201D he thought to himself. He had no clue that the coordinated global raid of AlphaBay was planned for just over 10 days later and that, according to the digits he now saw on his screen, it was targeting a server in the wrong country. He made a mental note to tell Gambaryan about the Lithuanian IP the next time he saw him.\nThe opportunity arrived that evening. After a day spent at the Europol conference, the two sat side by side at dinner with a dozen other agents, analysts, prosecutors, and contractors around a long table at Flavor\u2019s, a ribs-and-steak restaurant a few blocks from Europol headquarters, its walls covered in paintings of a medieval feast. They had just ordered drinks when Levin thought to mention to Gambaryan that their experimental idea had apparently worked. He showed Gambaryan the three IP addresses on his phone, pointing out the Lithuanian one that seemed most likely.\nThe IRS agent went silent. He pulled out his own phone and took a picture of Levin\u2019s screen. Then he stood up, blank-faced, and quickly walked out of the restaurant without explanation.\nLevin watched him go, dumbfounded. Gambaryan hadn\u2019t even paid for his beer.\nGAMBARYAN RAN THE eight blocks through the streets of the residential neighborhood, past The Hague\u2019s art museum, to the Marriott next to Europol headquarters, where he and most of the other international agents at the conference were staying. He went directly to the building\u2019s top floor, overlooking the darkened forest of Park Sorghvliet, ringed by international government buildings. At a table in an empty conference room, he opened his laptop, confirmed that the IP address Levin had found was indeed in a Lithuanian data center, and then began calling Operation Bayonet\u2019s prosecutors\u2014Grant Rabenn and Paul Hemesath in California, as well as Alden Pelker, the DC-based cybercrime attorney on the case, and Erin, the FBI Bitcoin-tracing analyst who was in The Hague attending the Europol conference\u2014to tell them that he and Chainalysis had found what appeared to be the true location of AlphaBay\u2019s central server, and it wasn\u2019t in the Netherlands but a thousand miles to the east.Soon Erin joined Gambaryan in the hotel conference room, with Hemesath and Rabenn on speakerphone from California, where it was still early in the day. Chainalysis\u2019 Levin arrived not long after, followed by Gronager, who\u2019d been attending a different business dinner; both men were pulled into the night\u2019s meeting on a need-to-know basis. Until the early hours of the morning, the group worked frantically to sort out the logistics of seizing AlphaBay\u2019s infrastructure not from the Netherlands, as they\u2019d intended, but from Lithuania, with their July 5 deadline just days away. At one point, a Dutch hotel worker came into the lounge to try to tell the group the room was closed. Gambaryan, who technically wasn\u2019t even part of the AlphaBay operation, flashed his badge at the man instinctively\u2014a badge that had no actual authority outside the United States\u2014and the startled Dutchman retreated, leaving them to their work.\nJust as they were on the cusp of victory, it seemed their plan had failed. \n\u201COh, shit,\u201D Rabenn silently concluded, in a state of blank panic. \u201CThis thing\u2019s over.\u201D\nUltimately, Gambaryan and Chainalysis\u2019 advanced analysis trick spared Operation Bayonet, at nearly the last minute, from what could have been a major error. The investigators would later learn that the Netherlands IP address they\u2019d been focused on for months pointed to a data center that held only an older server for the site, rather than the holy grail they were looking for. Just like Hansa, AlphaBay had apparently moved at some point from a Dutch hosting provider to the Baltics. Without the Lithuanian IP address, passed from Levin\u2019s phone to Gambaryan\u2019s in a steak restaurant, the investigators would have been raiding the equivalent of an abandoned hideout, leaving AlphaBay\u2019s actual criminal headquarters untouched.\nNone of the investigators in Operation Bayonet has ever explained the mechanics of that Hail Mary advanced-analysis technique publicly\u2014nor would they explain it to me in the years that followed. That\u2019s in part because the secrecy of the technique, agents and prosecutors suggested, had allowed it to be used again and again, identifying the IP addresses of dark-web services\u2019 Bitcoin wallets in a series of major cases. Law enforcement agencies wanted to make sure the method wasn\u2019t \u201Cburned\u201D\u2014exposed to dark-web administrators or Bitcoin developers who might be able to fix the vulnerabilities it exploited.\nFor anyone who followed the early days of Chainalysis, though, it would be hard not to take one particular educated guess at how the company\u2019s mysterious tool worked. In 2015, just months after its founding, the startup had caused a brief, very public blowup in the Bitcoin community with a technique capable of identifying Bitcoin users\u2019 IP addresses. The company had set up its own secret collection of Bitcoin nodes, the computers that serve as the communications backbone of the Bitcoin network. Unlike typical Bitcoin nodes, Chainalysis\u2019 nodes were designed to silently record the IP addresses Bitcoin users broadcast with every transaction. By quietly intercepting every IP that passed through the nodes, Chainalysis aimed to create a global map of Bitcoin users\u2019 physical locations.\nThe IP eavesdropping was meant as a demonstration of the young startup\u2019s capabilities. When it was discovered, however, the result was a long, venom-filled thread on the cryptocurrency forum BitcoinTalk, where Chainalysis was excoriated as a purveyor of \u201Cmass surveillance\u201D tools. Gronager, the company\u2019s CEO, apologized and shut down the experiment.\nYet, years later, could that technique somehow have been adapted to secretly target\u2014and locate\u2014the Bitcoin wallets of very specific users? Even when the transactions were sent from a computer running on the Tor anonymity network?For Operation Bayonet, all that mattered was that the IRS\u2019s Gambaryan and Chainalysis\u2019 Levin had, together, corrected the course of a massive, coordinated, international investigation at a critical moment, deploying a secret weapon with hardly a day to spare. But secret weapons don\u2019t tend to stay secret forever.\nCHAPTER 10\nThe Athenee\nIN THE LAST days of June, the Americans descended upon Bangkok like a tropical law enforcement convention.\nThey included nearly 20 agents, analysts, computer forensic experts, and prosecutors from the FBI, DEA, IRS, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Canada\u2019s Royal Canadian Mounted Police. More than a dozen members of the group checked in at the Athenee, a five-star hotel a few blocks from the US embassy, which advertised that it was built on grounds once owned by a 19th-century Siamese princess and featured eight restaurants and a rooftop complete with a garden and swimming pool. It was, the prosecutor Grant Rabenn noted, certainly the nicest hotel he\u2019d ever managed to book on the government\u2019s per diem.\nWith just days until their planned bust, Rabenn, Hemesath, and the DC prosecutor Louisa Marion remained swamped by the bureaucracy of coordinating law enforcement agencies in five countries\u2014the United States, Thailand, Canada, the Netherlands, and now Lithuania, where they had a fresh plan to seize the central AlphaBay server. The team also met repeatedly with the Thais at the headquarters of their Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB) across town, gathering in a conference room on the building\u2019s eighth floor to talk through the details of Cazes\u2019 arrest.\nThe central problem remained unsolved: how to distract Cazes and lure him out of his house with his phone unlocked and his laptop open and unencrypted. Set fire to a dumpster outside the house? Too dangerous, they decided. Have a female undercover agent begin screaming and crying outside his house? Cazes might simply ignore her, or else close the laptop before checking out the noise.What if they dressed an undercover agent as a postal worker who knocked on the door and asked Cazes to come sign for a package? That, they concluded, might work.\nAmid all this frantic eleventh-hour planning, a core group still managed to cap off each day at the Athenee\u2019s lounge for its all-you-can-eat sushi happy hours. It was during one of those evening gatherings that something surprising appeared in the group chat the Thai police had set up on a messaging app called Line, popular in Thailand. The Thais used the group chat to post constant updates to one another and to the DEA on their physical surveillance of Cazes. That day, the Thai team assigned to Operation Bayonet had been following their target on an early evening outing, tracking him in his Porsche Panamera as he approached central Bangkok. Jen Sanchez, who lived near both the Athenee and her workplace at the US embassy building down the street, had just returned home when she saw a photo, taken by one of the Thai officers, pop up. It showed a white Porsche, parked at a swanky-looking hotel entrance.\n\u201CWhat the fuck?\u201D she thought, with a sudden rush of adrenaline. Wasn\u2019t that the Athenee, where much of the US team was staying?\nAt that moment, in the Athenee lounge, Rabenn recalls seeing the same Porsche out of the corner of his peripheral vision and instantly remembering that a white Panamera was in Cazes\u2019 stable of pricey vehicles. He pointed it out to Hemesath, as well as the DEA\u2019s Miller and an FBI agent, all of them sitting together at a table in the lobby. They half-jokingly suggested that the FBI agent go check it out.\nThe agent gamely strolled across the lounge as a figure walked through the front door of the Athenee. A spasm of shock went through Rabenn\u2019s mind.\nIt was him. Alexandre Cazes. And he was walking directly toward Rabenn, Miller, and Hemesath\u2019s table.\nRabenn froze. \u201CIt was like seeing a ghost,\u201D he remembers. He glanced over at Hemesath, who seemed equally paralyzed, in disbelief.\nThe image of that first in-person encounter with Cazes, after nine months of obsessively tracking Alpha02, remains burned into Rabenn\u2019s memory. Cazes was dressed, Rabenn remembers, in a slim, expensive-looking blue suit, his white shirt unbuttoned underneath in the style of someone too rich to wear a tie. Yet Rabenn also observed that Cazes moved with a certain nerdy awkwardness\u2014that, under his costume, he looked \u201Cmore like a pudgy programmer pretending to be a rock star than an actual rock star.\u201D\nThe FBI agent, thinking quickly, avoided eye contact with Cazes and walked directly past him to the door. In the seconds it took for Cazes to cross the room, seemingly in slow motion, thoughts raced through Rabenn\u2019s mind: How did Cazes know who they were? Or that they were on his trail? Or which hotel they were staying at in Bangkok? Had there been a leak? Had they been meeting too conspicuously, blowing their opsec? Had this criminal mastermind outsmarted them?In mere moments, Rabenn expected Cazes to sit down next to them at their table, smug expression on his face, and say, as he imagined it, \u201CFuck you guys, I know you\u2019re here, and you\u2019re not going to get anything.\u201D\nRabenn realized he had no idea how he would respond. They could arrest Cazes on the spot, but they\u2019d lose all hope of getting access to his laptop or any smoking-gun evidence of his control of AlphaBay. Just as they were on the cusp of victory, it seemed their plan had failed.\n\u201COh, shit,\u201D Rabenn silently concluded, in a state of blank panic. \u201CThis thing\u2019s over.\u201D\nThen, when Cazes was about 5 feet away from their table, he turned and sat down at the table next to them, across from a pair of Israeli businessmen wearing suits and yarmulkes.\nThe Americans looked at each other in confusion. After a moment, the FBI agent returned and sat down casually. He and Miller began silently signaling to the rest of the table that everyone else should leave.\nRabenn, recovering his composure, allowed the thought to cross his mind that perhaps all was not lost\u2014that this was simply the most stunning coincidence of his life.\nDoing their best to act naturally, the prosecutors cleared out and walked up the curved staircase to the mezzanine floor of the hotel, while the FBI agent and Miller hung back to eavesdrop on Cazes\u2019 conversation at the neighboring table. On the floor above, Rabenn and Hemesath shared a moment of wide-eyed relief. Text messages from the FBI and DEA agents still at the table began to roll in, reporting on Cazes\u2019 meeting: He was talking with the Israelis about one of his real estate investment deals in the Caribbean.\nAs their panic subsided, they now saw that a group of Thai undercover police\u2014including the team leader, Colonel Pisal Erb-Arb, in plain clothes\u2014had stationed themselves around another table across the hotel lounge from Cazes and were discreetly watching him, even stealthily taking photos of each other that captured Cazes in the background. The AlphaBay founder gave no sign of having spotted them.\nAs Rabenn and Hemesath silently rejoiced, the FBI agent joined them on the mezzanine floor and pulled out his phone. He started Googling, trying to calculate the odds of what had just happened. How many hotels were there in Bangkok, anyway? He quickly showed them the answer: There were thousands.\nIn a euphoric daze, the two prosecutors marveled at their bizarre near-collision\u2014but not for long. In two days, they knew their team would be encountering Cazes face-to-face again, this time in the most elaborate arrest they had ever attempted.\nContinued next week: The day of the takedown arrives. Operation Bayonet reaches its kinetic climax. And then the case takes a tragic twist.\nThis story is excerpted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available now from Doubleday.\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

The $25,000 in assets he keeps with the crypto exchange, equivalent to a decade\u2019s worth of savings, was suddenly out of his reach.\nSamuel, who asked to be referred to only by first name to preserve his anonymity, says he lives somewhere in Southeast Asia and is currently between jobs, which means money is tight. The cryptocurrency in his FTX account was his nest egg.\nSamuel first caught wind of a problem at FTX on November 6, but dismissed the reports as simple \u201CFUD\u201D\u2014a term used in crypto circles to describe baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt. He says he thought that FTX, until now one of the world\u2019s most reputable exchanges, was \u201Cbulletproof\u201D and there was no way his funds could be in danger. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried helped contribute to this misconception, tweeting on November 7 that \u201CFTX is fine. Assets are fine.\u201D (The tweet has now been deleted.)\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow this Guy Makes the World\u2019s Smallest Handmade Sculptures\nThis week, it became clear that FTX was on the brink of collapse. Today it voluntarily started bankruptcy proceedings in the US, joining the ranks of Mt. Gox, Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, and others in the crypto hall of shame. The troubled exchange was briefly handed a lifeline on Tuesday when Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance (who goes by the name CZ), announced on Twitter that a rescue deal had been reached. But less than 48 hours later, Binance backed out, citing the results of corporate due diligence and news reports of mishandling of customer funds at FTX.\nSamuel\u2019s portfolio is made up predominantly of a cryptocurrency called XRP, the price of which is thought to have been depressed by an ongoing lawsuit between its issuer, Ripple Labs, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Recently, there have been signs the two-year legal battle may be coming to a close\u2014and Samuel had been sitting tight in the hope that a favorable ruling might send the price of XRP skyward. But now, with his tokens locked up in FTX, he won\u2019t be able to reap the rewards for his patience. \u201CI could see the finish line, but this latest drama has me hanged by the balls,\u201D he says. \u201CIt\u2019s just so much hardship.\u201D\nThere are many FTX customers with stories like this one. One FTX trader, who asked to remain anonymous, was in the US when they first heard of trouble at the exchange, which meant it was not possible to immediately withdraw their funds (FTX International, not to be confused with FTX US, is unavailable in the country.) When the FTX trader eventually used a VPN service to bypass the geo-restrictions, they found their withdrawal password needed to be reset, a process that for security reasons prevents money from being taken out of an account for 24 hours. By that time, it was already too late.\nThe FTX trader has the equivalent of $350,000 locked up in FTX, which they say amounts to 97 percent of their liquid net worth and represents 15 years\u2019 worth of savings and investment gains. Unable to access the funds, they are now \u201Cin a highly vulnerable position due to debt and other liabilities that I may now be unable to service.\u201D The fall of FTX, they say, \u201Chas changed my previously conditional trust in centralized exchanges\u2014no matter how large and reputable\u2014into an unconditional distrust.\u201DAaron Kaplan, a securities attorney and co-CEO of trading platform Prometheum, says that although the final outcome for FTX and its customers is not yet crystal clear, there is precedent in scenarios such as this for people never to recover their funds. Unfortunately, those caught up in the collapse are left with little in the way of legal recourse, says Kaplan. \u201CThe facts will come out in time. What is clear at this present moment is that FTX was taking advantage of a gray area at the heart of which was the expectation of profit, irrespective of the best interest of customers.\u201D\nIn a Twitter thread announcing the bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried implied he still hopes to help customers recover their funds. But thinking this unlikely, some FTX customers are attempting to flog their account balances at a steep discount. As reported by CoinDesk on November 9, buyers on messaging platform Telegram are bidding $0.10 to $0.15 cents on the dollar for funds tied up in FTX, gambling on the chance they may eventually be released.\nThe financial impact of the collapse extends far beyond the immediate FTX customer base, too. The week\u2019s events have sent other crypto coins into a downward spiral, with the price of both bitcoin and ether falling by more than 10 percent, wiping upward of $60 billion from the market. Large sums of SOL, the native token of the Solana network, are owned by FTX and its subsidiaries, and therefore has been hit even harder. Between November 7 and November 9, the value of SOL fell from $32 per coin to $13.\nA crypto trader who goes by the name Mando CT had at one point yesterday lost $637,000 on his SOL holdings and various Solana-based NFTs. (A slight recovery in the price of SOL, combined with other bets, has since helped him recoup some of these losses.) He says he remains confident in Solana\u2019s core value proposition and quality of the technology, and has even purchased more SOL in an attempt to \u201Cbuy the dip\u201D, but concedes the fall of FTX will have \u201Ca huge impact on the whole market.\u201D\nAlthough developers whose apps sit atop Solana claim it\u2019s still the best network for building services at scale\u2014the CEOs of both Audium and Irreverent Labs, two such development studios, say they are unconcerned about price of SOL\u2014others predict the knock-on effects of the FTX crash will have a detrimental effect on the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\u201CDevelopers in the blockchain space tend to put their efforts where the most money is located,\u201D says Francesco Melpignano, CEO at Kadena Eco, which helps to incubate new projects tied to the Kadena blockchain. \u201CIf we see funds leaking away from Solana, developers will certainly be more incentivized to build elsewhere.\u201D\nElsewhere, BlockFi says it was forced to cease operations, citing \u201Ca lack of clarity\u201D over the situation at FTX. The crypto lender had itself been bailed out by FTX US earlier this year after it was caught up in the Three Arrows Capital collapse, but its future is now uncertain, illustrating the contagion effect described by CZ earlier today. \u201CWith FTX going down, we will see cascading effects,\u201D he said. \u201CEspecially for those close to the FTX ecosystem.\u201D\nIn the days since the crisis began, FTX\u2019s Bankman-Fried, who is usually a prolific tweeter, has been uncharacteristically quiet. In a manic Twitter thread posted yesterday afternoon, he broke his silence: \u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D he tweeted. \u201CI fucked up, and should have done better.\u201D\nThe FTX founder gave a puzzling explanation of the events that led up to the fall (something to do with \u201Ca poor labeling of bank-related accounts,\u201D apparently) and set out a plan to do right by customers. \u201CWe\u2019re spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity,\u201D he wrote. \u201CEvery penny of that\u2014and of the existing collateral\u2014will go straight to users, unless or until we\u2019ve done right by them.\u201D\nAlthough it will be cold comfort to those whose funds are stranded in the exchange, Bankman-Fried has himself suffered extraordinary losses.

Alongside projects like Shops, Meta\u2019s ambitious plan to turn Instagram and Facebook into e-ommerce giants; its podcast plans; Facebook Portal and a Meta smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch, they all failed.\nIn pursuit of becoming the everything platform, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has thrown a lot of stuff at the wall. Precious little of it has stuck, except for the headcount brought to work on these projects.\nYesterday, Zuckerberg announced mammoth layoffs at Meta: 11,000 people in all\u2014some 13 percent of the company and nearly three times the number let go by Twitter, which fired 50 percent of its workforce on November 4. He blamed his own decision to increase investments and an ad revenue crunch caused by Apple\u2019s decision to give users more control over how their personal information is used for advertising purposes.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nThis Heart is Not Human\nBut that only tells part of the story, according to company insiders and people tracking the company\u2019s business from the outside. \u201CToday\u2019s news isn\u2019t only a correction of the pandemic years,\u201D says one former Meta employee with knowledge of the company\u2019s operations, who left shortly before the layoffs were announced and spoke anonymously because his current employer would not grant him the right to speak on the record to WIRED. \u201CI would say it\u2019s probably the last five to 10 years\u201D\u2014originating even before Zuckerberg\u2019s Metaverse obsession. Some of the losses can be attributed to the sheer range of risky and failed experiments the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram parent company has conducted over the years, the former employee says. \u201CI just can\u2019t think in the last five years of a successful Meta app or feature that wasn\u2019t acquired,\u201D the ex-employee says\u2014before suggesting Stories, perhaps, which itself was borrowed from Snapchat.\nThose distractions from Meta\u2019s core business are what the former employee says are harming the company\u2014and are why the layoffs this week were quite so significant. Had there been natural attrition as each attempt to innovate failed and fell by the wayside, the reduction in staff numbers would have been stretched out over time. \u201CWe just launched this huge blockchain initiative that required hundreds of people\u2014or maybe even more,\u201D says the former employee. \u201CWhen that thing went away, what happened to those people? They just kind of stayed and worked on other experiments and research.\u201D The former employee cites issues with internal communication that suggested people drifted off into obscurity within the massive Meta machine. \u201CIt seemed like we were doing all these things that went nowhere, but we never got an update of: \u2018It went nowhere, but here\u2019s the actions we\u2019re taking\u2019,\u201D he says.\nNew projects helped Facebook to accumulate employees rapidly. Flush with cash as one of the world\u2019s biggest companies, and with big plans for dominating all aspects of consumers\u2019 lives, the company formerly known as Facebook hired plentifully. In 2017, Meta employed 25,000 staff. And before it sliced 11,000 from its payroll, it had 87,000 employees. The company has grown headcount by an average of 28 percent in each of the last five years. Even after these latest cuts, the newly slimmed-down Meta is still three times as large as it was in 2017.\u201CThey\u2019ve overhired and are trying a lot of different things,\u201D says Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School. \u201CMark Zuckerberg right now is not clear about what he wants from his company.\u201D George points to the rebranding of Facebook as Meta as an example of the uncertainty around the future direction of the company: \u201CIt sent signals that maybe he felt that Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp had tapered off, and that he wanted to move to VR. But that obviously has not paid off yet.\u201D Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA former Meta engineer, who left before this week\u2019s cull, tells WIRED they were brought into the company to work on a project that months later was canned. The engineer was left to float within the company.\n\u201CMeta layoffs are an ominous sign of dark days ahead for Zuckerberg,\u201D says Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. Both he and George of Harvard question Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to go all in on the metaverse.\n\u201CI believe that Mark needs to be chairman and give up the CEO job and bring in a professional CEO,\u201D George says. Other tech companies have successfully divided the roles of founder and CEO, he says, including Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Oracle. \u201CI think Mark could concentrate on his dream for Meta, but at the same time, somebody's got to run the business and many of his advertisers are pulling out,\u201D he says. \u201CAnd that's where the revenue comes from.\u201D\nThat bloat, and the ghosts in the machine that it left, has been Meta\u2019s fatal flaw, the former employee suggests. \u201CThe company just kept growing and growing,\u201D he says. \u201CNo one seriously thought: \u2018Why are we growing? Do we actually need the people we\u2019re hiring, or are we just hiring because we like to hire?\u2019\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/636d260c3bb084d7eff58797\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Meta-Layoffs-Business-1178141612.jpeg","author":"BY CHRIS STOKEL-WALKER","title":"The Reason for Meta's Massive Layoffs?

Mastodon is a loosely connected network of individually run servers, which all play by their own rules and answer to their own moderators. It's a very different environment than Twitter.

If there's a server for Swedish psych pop.\nLauren Goode: You are never going to live down Swedish psych pop. I think you mentioned that at a conference, in like a mixed crowd a few years ago, and now you're just Swedish psych pop guy.\nMichael Calore: I am perfectly happy with that.\nLauren Goode: I don't know if there's a Mastodon server for Swedish psych pop, but I am curious whether or not you think we could technically set one up in the time it takes to record this podcast.\nMichael Calore: Maybe.\nLauren Goode: Probably not.\nMichael Calore: I don't really know much about it.\nLauren Goode: Well, on the upside, someone is going to demystify Mastodon for us today.\nMichael Calore: Sweet. Let's do it.\n[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]\nLauren Goode: Hi everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: And I'm Michael Calore. I'm a senior editor at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: We're also joined this week by WIRED senior editor Andrew Couts, who is coming to us from a hamlet in upstate New York.\nAndrew Couts: Hi, everybody.\nLauren Goode: I just wanted to say hamlet. Hey, Andrew. How many people live in this hamlet?\nAndrew Couts: 188.\nLauren Goode: Seriously?\nAndrew Couts: Yes.\nLauren Goode: That's incredible. Are you like mayor there?\nAndrew Couts: Nope, but I probably could be if I wanted to. I don't know if we even have a mayor. We have a board, but it's very small. It's quaint. It's nice.\nLauren Goode: I'm willing to bet that of everyone who lives in your hamlet, you have the most followers on Mastodon.\nAndrew Couts: That is probably true. I kind of hope it's true, because if it's not, then that means my neighbors are weirder than I think they are.\nLauren Goode: And you need to go friend them immediately. All right, well, we've definitely tipped off what we're talking about today. Right now, if you're active on any popular social media platform like Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, you're using a centralized social media app. What does this even mean? Basically, it means that one body or one corporation holds all the power over that network. It might also mean that you really experience one primary feed when you log on to the app, but in the first two extremely chaotic weeks of Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter, another narrative has emerged, one about decentralized social media apps. And one in particular, it's called Mastodon. Now Mastodon looks and feels a little like Twitter, but it's pretty different at its core, so we've invited Andrew on to talk about it\u2014because Andrew, I think you, like me, spent all weekend banging your head against the keyboard trying to figure out Mastodon. Is that correct?Andrew Couts: Yes. I have spent far too much time on Mastodon. I think my weekly screen report said I was up 16 percent over the past week, and almost all of that was spent on Mastodon, and definitely the most increase was on Mastodon. I am a little bit obsessed with it.\nLauren Goode: OK, so what is it?\nAndrew Couts: So Mastodon is, like you said, a decentralized social network. It looks very similar to Twitter in a lot of ways. It has some different vocabularies, it has some different rules or at least social norms than Twitter does, but overall, it's a very similar experience. The big difference is the decentralized bit, which means that my account might exist on a different server than your account, but they can talk to each other, and there's no reason to be too concerned about that. It's just a little bit different in the way it's set up, and it can have big implications for content moderation and all types of different aspects that make up our overall social experience there.\nMichael Calore: So the thing that people often talk about when they talk about Twitter, and the thing that I would argue makes Twitter special, is its role as the great public square of the internet. It's the place where everybody is hanging out in the same spot talking about whatever they want to talk about with their individual communities inside that public square, but there's no fence that you have to hop over to go from one community to another. It's just one big community. So how is Mastodon different in that way? How much of a public square can it be?\nAndrew Couts: I think it could be the same kind of public square as Twitter. There's very little friction between the different servers, and really you don't recognize when you're talking to somebody on a different server than the one you're on. It all looks the same, and you can follow people from different servers. There is the option for a server to not be connected to the network, so you could have your own little social network with only people who know your server and it never communicates with another server. That's something somebody could do. However, it's really easy to connect a server to another one. For example, if I boosted a post from Lauren's server, and a boost is very similar to a retweet, that would automatically connect her Mastodon instance or Mastodon server to the rest of the Mastodon network. And so just as little as a retweet or a boost is something that can introduce your server to the rest of the Mastodon ecosystem, which is then part of a bigger, they call it a Fediverse, that are other applications that are on top of this thing. All these terms are what make this all a big barrier to entry for people, and it makes it really confusing, but it's not really that complicated once you're actually using it.Lauren Goode: So take us through some of these wonky terms. You mentioned boosts. They are also something called toots. There's the Fediverse. What do we need to know?\nAndrew Couts: Toots is the, I would say, unfortunate word for tweet. And honestly, I think it's going out of favor. People are just saying post, and it's kind of normalizing it, but Mastodon's been around since I believe 2017.\n[Correction, 11:23 am on 11\/10\/22: Mastodon has been around since 2016, actually.]\nAndrew Couts: And so it developed its own little culture. And until we all invaded that space over the past two weeks, they had their own little ways and norms that were, I think, really smart and wise in some ways to keep it a good community. But other things, like \u201Ctoot.\u201D might go out of favor. The Fediverse is the name for everything that is connected that's using the same protocol as Mastodon. And so you can have a video-sharing platform or a photo-sharing platform, and those exist on the Fediverse, and you can connect your Mastodon account to those accounts and use the internet a little bit differently with these decentralized social media apps.\nLauren Goode: And that's short for Federated Universe, is that correct?\nAndrew Couts: Yes, that's correct. Sorry, I should explain that. \u201CFederated\u201D is what it means when \u2026 I'm going to botch this, and someone's going to yell at me. But basically, it just means that it's a bunch of networks that are connected together where you can see everything that's on all the connected networks.\nMichael Calore: So when I log to Mastodon and I land on my server, what do I see? Do I just see the people's posts on my server, or do I see people's posts from the Fediverse? Is there a way to select what I see? Because when you show up on Twitter, there's this algorithmically generated stream that shows me all of the tweets of all the people that I'm following. Or if I'm not following a lot of people, it suggests a bunch of people for me to follow. What's the login experience like on Mastodon? What do I see when I show up?\nAndrew Couts: So when you first log in, you will only be able to see posts from everyone on your server. So for example, I'm on the mastodon.socialserver. I believe that's the first one that was set up, and it's one of the largest, if not the largest server. So everybody who is on there, I can see it on my local tab, so \u201Clocal\u201D is everybody on your server. There's also the Federated tab that will show you everybody within all of Mastodon. And then there's your home tab, which is the one that I use most frequently now that I have a good number of people I'm following. And so the home tab is just people you follow regardless of what server they're on, so it's going to be the most similar to what you see on your Twitter feed based on who you follow. So the home tab is where it's at.Lauren Goode: So even though this is a decentralized network, I'm curious about who runs it and who funds it. Is there any kind of leadership or chief executive or, as Elon Musk is now describing himself, like the chief hotline? What is a chief complaint hotline operator? Is there someone you can basically ring up or drop a line to and say like, \u201CHey, I want to talk to you about this,\u201D and who is funding Mastodon?\nAndrew Couts: So nobody owns Mastodon overall. It's basically a protocol, and then whoever runs your server owns that instance of Mastodon. And so that's one of the things that makes it a lot different than Twitter. There's no one person to complain to. Probably if you were going to say, \"Hey, I'm getting harassed by a bunch of trolls,\" you would go to the admins of your server. There is somebody who founded Mastodon and kind of is in charge. His name's Eugen Rochko,  and he's the main developer and the main person behind Mastodon. But only in the, I believe, the Mastodon.social instance or any other one that he's involved in would you want to complain directly to him. He's really active on Mastodon. I think he seems pretty accessible. But in general, you're going to want to talk to whoever the admins are of your instance, or you could start your own instance and you could complain to yourself.\nLauren Goode: And what about funding?\nAndrew Couts: I don't actually know the answer to that. It's a nonprofit, so I believe it's mostly crowdsourced funding. I know they have a Patreon page, and so that's who you would be giving to. You would be giving to the main Mastodon nonprofit. But besides that, I'm sure that there are Patreon pages for individual servers, individual instances, and it's mostly just a crowdfunded thing. Nobody owns it, so there's nobody to pay or anything of that nature. You're not going to be charged $8 for using Mastodon. And if you were, you could move to another Mastodon server and ignore that.\nLauren Goode: All right. Well, we have to take a quick break, but when we come back, we're going to talk more about this whole concept of a decentralized social network.\n[Break]\nLauren Goode: Mike, do you have a better idea now of what Mastodon is?\nMichael Calore: Yes, it's all becoming clear to me.\nLauren Goode: Are you ready to join your Swedish psych pop server? Maybe you can start one.\nMichael Calore: I could start one, yes. It would be like me and four other turbo nerds.\nLauren Goode: All right. Well, I want to talk to Andrew more about what it means to be on a decentralized social network, and if it's self-governed, how secure that all is. Andrew, what would you say are the biggest considerations that people should have when they join something that is decentralized?Andrew Couts: The biggest thing to consider when joining a decentralized network is to recognize that the person who runs your instance or server or the people who run it have access to everything you do there. This is also true with Twitter, and it's one of the big reasons why everyone is fleeing now that Elon Musk is the person who controls that on Twitter. But on Mastodon, you have any number of people who can control that depending on what instance you're on, so it's really you need to trust who your instance admins are, and that's a big reason why a lot of people are starting their own instances, because they don't want somebody else to be in control of their direct messages, things like that. Another thing I would say about \u2026 This isn't about decentralized networks in general, but one thing about Mastodon is that direct messages work a lot differently. DMs are posts, but you just control who can see those posts, and you can set it to be only the people who are mentioned within those posts. If you happen to mention another user, you put their at handle in there, they will automatically be included in those DMs. So you don't want to go talking behind somebody's back and mention them in a DM, because they're going to get access to that DM, as an example. Again, as a security editor, I'm always recommending that if you really want to say something private, don't say it on a social network regardless. Take it to Signal. You could take it to WhatsApp or even Telegram, where things are, to one degree or another, end-to-end encrypted. That's where you want to keep your private messages. But just one thing to know about Mastodon is that DMs work a little bit differently, and they might surprise you how they work if you do it a little bit wrong.\nLauren Goode: In this case, is decentralization tied in any way to the blockchain? Is this a bigger part of the whole pitch around Web3?\nAndrew Couts: As far as I know, there's no direct connection between Mastodon and Web3 or the blockchain at this point. Decentralization is definitely something that is talked about as part of Web3, but it's decentralized in a slightly different way. We're not talking about blockchain-based technology, we're talking about a different protocol essentially.\nMichael Calore: How does moderation work on these servers? Because in a centralized model, if somebody is being a jerk on the platform, they get booted from the platform. So if somebody's being a jerk on my instance or on my server, and I boot him from my server, can he just go be a jerk somewhere else on somebody else's server?\nAndrew Couts: Moderation works a little bit differently on Mastodon. So to answer your question, yes, that person could go and sign up for another server. However, you also have the option to block entire servers. So for example, if some neo-Nazis created a Mastodon server where it's just a bunch of neo-Nazis, you could block that entire server and a lot of other people could block them too, and so they essentially get cut out from the main conversations, and they're not able to wage these campaigns, so there is some democratized moderation that happens. Moderation also happens at the server level. So whoever runs your instance or your server can create the rules that they want to create and enforce those rules how they say fit. They're the masters of their domain. I kind of think of instant admins as benevolent dictators and we are all in these little fiefdoms of Mastodon, and so they can enforce the rules how they want. You also have the ability as a user to block whoever you want to block, including blocking entire servers.Michael Calore: I want to play devil's advocate a little bit here and say that we've tried in the past to build social environments on open-sourced, decentralized systems before on the internet. And some of them will survive if they're very well maintained and the community has a definite long-view purpose, like a list serve or a newsgroup that is still going. But for social media at a really large scale, it seems like the centralized platforms have always won. Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Hacker News. They all have owners. They all have rules. Those rules could change. We're sort of at their mercy. So I mean, I understand the vision, but practically, this can never be as big as Twitter.\nAndrew Couts: I would say practically speaking, it's going to be difficult for it to get to that scale. However, we've already seen the network deal with a massive influx of people. I think they're up to over 6 million users at this point, which is far more than they had before Musk bought Twitter and everybody started fleeing, so it remains to be seen. It depends on how invested people get. If there are enough people willing to run servers, if there are enough people willing to pay to maintain those servers, then yeah, we could see it grow to be as large as Twitter, which is much smaller itself than Facebook or TikTok or a lot of other social networks, but it just remains to be seen. I'm cautiously optimistic about Mastodon's potential. I think it really just depends on whether people stay interested when we're outside of this whirlwind of news and Musk seemingly doing some drastic shift every 10 seconds. We'll see how it goes, but so far so good. They've survived this influx of people, and they've been around for years now, so I don't think it's going anywhere. Whether everybody wants to keep using it, that remains to be seen.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, that's a good point.\nLauren Goode: I will say, despite the fact that Mastodon has been around since 2017, right now, it does have that chaotic, but good chaotic, energy right now. That early web, let's-fuck-around-and-find-out, let's tinker with things, look at this new feature, who else is here for the hang? It's kind of fun to spend time on once you get over that initial hurdle of finding a server and actually signing up, which took an entire weekend for me.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: I was just waiting and waiting for a verification email and it finally came through. Twitter feels chaotic right now, but it's a very dark timeline. We're taping this on election day, and so it's like, how is Twitter going to disrupt democracy yet again, and it's not a good chaotic energy, and Mastodon still feels new.\nMichael Calore: It's going to be a wild two years. I do think that a lot of that onboarding experience that you're talking about, Lauren, that is something that could be solved by a good user experience. And the barrier of the server, you need to find a server to hook up to, just the concept of that is very difficult for a lot of people to understand. So some of that can be solved with changing the name or creating a very clear signup flow. I haven't seen one yet. I'm also curious about the apps, if there are good mobile apps for posting to Mastodon and browsing Mastodon, and how do those fit into the Federated environment and the decentralized environment?Andrew Couts: So just to go back to the user experience part for a moment, I think one of the things that makes \u2026 I agree with Lauren, one of the things that's really exciting about Mastodon is that it doesn't feel new, it feels old. It feels like the internet that I grew up with, and I think part of that is that there's not just passive consumption or even passive content creation. You can also build things for it. You can maintain your own server, but you can also create tools. And you see a lot of people doing that. There's a real creator energy to the space right now, and I think that having some greater control than you do over a centralized network and your experience there has really invigorated people to want to invest in a different way. And so I think that that's really exciting. And I think one of the ways we can see that evolving is people creating a better onboarding experience and not just being a few overworked engineers who work for the mass nonprofit there, it could be somebody else entirely who's completely independent, who just creates something that makes the users experience a lot better. I do think we'll see an evolution of the terms and people either getting familiar with things like instance and Fediverse and all that kind of stuff, or just people stopping using those terms and explaining it a little bit better. So we'll see how that goes. As far as the apps are concerned, there's a bunch of different apps. There's the main Mastodon app, which I don't actually like that much. I found it to be a little bit glitchy at this point. I'm currently using one called Metatext, and it kind of has all the features that I would want on Twitter, to the extent that Mastodon mirrors those same experiences, and it's been really stable. I did have some lag last night. My personal take on it is that having to be patient a little bit with your tech isn't a bad thing. I've kind of found it to be like, OK, it's not working right now. I'm going to go do something else. And it kind of stops the cycle of doomscrolling. And it's like the glitch is the same as that random person on TikTok who jumps up and says, \"Hey, you've been on TikTok for way too long, you dirt bag. Maybe go do something else and spend time with your family,\" or whatever they say. I always scroll past it too fast to know actually what the whole message is, but I think that there's \u2026 I found it to be more relaxing to have kind of a built-in pause button on my consumption of i,t because I did go a little bit overboard this weekend, so we'll see how it evolves. There's a bunch of other apps too, though. There's Toot, which is a paid app. I believe it's available on both iOS and Android, that a lot of people like. There's five or six of them on iOS. I think there's a few others. If you search the app stores, you'll be able to find them. I recommend Metatext. It's worked really well for me, and it's free. No in-app purchases or anything like that.Lauren Goode: Andrew, can I tell you something? Mike actually pays attention to those warnings when they pop up on his phone, where they're like, \u201COh, you've spent 15 minutes on this app. It's time to go do something else.\u201D He actually heeds the warnings.\nMichael Calore: I do.\nLauren Goode: I don't know anyone else who does. It's amazingly disciplined. I admire it.\nMichael Calore: Well, thank you.\nLauren Goode: But to me, it's just hitting snooze. It's like \u2026\nMichael Calore: It's just a good habit that I've developed over the last three or four years. I don't know what it is. I just kind of trained my brain to do it. I know that not everybody can do it, but \u2026 The thing you're talking about, Andrew, reminds me of the fail whale. The early days of Twitter, when Twitter used to crash all the time, and then you sort of had to take a break from Twitter. And like you were saying, Lauren, it had that chaotic-in-a-good-way energy, because the fail whale could pop up at any time.\nLauren Goode: It's big whale energy.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. People were joining. People were like, \u201CHey, what's going on this side?\u201D That kind of curiosity, not really knowing what to post. So it's been kind of fun to watch that happen elsewhere, even if I'm doing it from afar.\nAndrew Couts: One of the things I've liked about the Mastodon experience is people are willing to be earnest in a way that they were not on Twitter. People are just being a little bit more vulnerable or just being themselves or just saying things that they actually mean. It's not all just either yelling at each other or jokes or just people posting news or announcements or whatever it is that non-journalists do on Twitter. I found it to be just kind of refreshing in that way. One of the things I've learned is that the way that the community has arisen is by being very much about communication and conversation, in a way that Twitter evolved to not be that, and evolved to be the worst place possible for that. And I think we're going to see changes there, and they're probably not going to be good ones. But at the moment, the DNA of the Mastodon community is trying to dictate it being a, not a friendly place necessarily, but a respectful place and a good place to have conversations. And I've had the best interactions I've had with people online on Mastodon over the past couple of weeks. I have to say, I hope that stays the same.\nLauren Goode: It really does feel like right now is the best of the internet and the worst of the internet all happening at once. All right, let's take another quick break. And when we come back, we're going to do our favorite segment: recommendations.[Break]\nLauren Goode: Andrew, you're up first. What is your recommendation this week?\nAndrew Couts: My recommendation, I'm going to go with a classic gadget recommendation, is the Fi dog collars. The privacy side of my brain hates them because it tracks the location of my dogs and my phone constantly, so I'm sure that there's good reasons to not want to use this device, but all my dogs got really fat, and this has made them get less fat. And I really like it. It tracks all their steps and everything. It makes it much easier to be a good, responsible dog owner and keep your dogs healthy, because you push them a little bit farther than you really want to on their walks and things like that, and it really helps your dogs stay trim. And it can also track them if they get lost, which mine have. Fortunately, knock on wood. But yeah, Fi dog collars.\nLauren Goode: We're going to need to know everything about your dogs quickly, their names. You can rattle them off Matt Damon-style and their ages and their breeds, please.\nAndrew Couts: Sure. I have three dogs. My first dog is Sajo. He's a 12-year-old German shepherd. We also have Lucho who is a 3-year-old German shepherd, and Truffle who is an 11-month-old yellow lab. Lucho and Truffle are both dropouts from Guiding Eyes for the Blind, which is a guide dog school where my wife runs the adoption program, so both of them had some slightly not guide dog traits, and so we got to adopt them when they were little puppies, and they're good.\nLauren Goode: That's amazing. So Truffle, you said?\nAndrew Couts: Truffle, yes.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, It sounds like he was just being set on the path to be a wee bit pudgy.\nAndrew Couts: Yeah, and she came in after we got the Fi call for Lucho, who was the main fat one. Truffle is actually jacked. She's like a jacked little puppy because of Lucho. she weighs around 60 pounds. Lucho is a little over a 100 pounds, not fat, and so she thinks she's a 100-pound German shepherd and plays like one. She's the fittest of the bunch.\nLauren Goode: Oh, so she's going to stand on the podium with you when you accept your bid for mayor.\nAndrew Couts: Exactly.\nLauren Goode: How much do these collars cost?\nAndrew Couts: I think they're around $80, but there seems to be a perpetual sale, so I'm not sure. And I think they just came out with a new one, the Series Three, which I have deemed not worth my money yet. So we'll see.\nLauren Goode: A series-three dog collar. Like they're Apple. This is the next generation. Good morning, this is our new dog collar.\nMichael Calore: We're all past the point now where it does not feel weird to do things like charge our dog collars or charge our basketball shoes or charge our surfboards.Lauren Goode: No, I do not charge a surfboard. All right, thanks again for that awesome recommendation. More dogs on Gadget Lab.\nMichael Calore: More dogs.\nLauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation this week?\nMichael Calore: I'm going to recommend a book. It's a book that I just finished. It's called So Much Things to Say: The Oral History of Bob Marley, and it's written by Roger Steffens. It's an oral history, so it's a book of interviews, but our guide through the history of Bob Marley's life is Roger Steffens, who is a longtime broadcaster, reggae scholar, and one of the world experts on Bob Marley and that world of Jamaican music known as reggae music, which I'm a big fan of. And I've read a lot of Bob Marley books. There are a ton of Bob Marley books, and I've read most of them, and this one is by far the best one I have ever read. It's excellent. Roger Steffens has about 40 years worth of interviews with all of the people around Bob, his family members, his band members, former band members, business associates, lovers, children, and he's assembled this book that takes us through Bob's very early years, right up until his death at 36 from melanoma. And it is just really interesting because it's the only book that I've read about Bob that paints him as a real complex, three-dimensional individual. A lot of times when there's a figure who is a really big, important figure for a lot of people ... In many parts of the world, Bob Marley is considered like a prophet. He's considered a saint. He's above human. And a lot of the books about him sort of take that stance where his life is viewed through the lens of somebody who is destined for immortality. This book really presents him as a real human being, a man with problems and joys and sadness and setbacks and successes. It's just phenomenal. The best part about it, of course, is hearing all of the voices of his friends and family talk about him and all of his complexity. So I could definitely recommend it to anybody who is a lover of reggae music or has read Bob Marley books or is just interested in hearing more about his life because he was such a big figure in music. And even if you're jaded, because I'm jaded, like I said, I've read all these books, I did not need another one in my life until this one came along, and then I realized that this is the only one that you really need to read. So, So Much Things to Say, by Roger Steffens. That's my recommendation.\nLauren Goode: Awesome. Thanks Mike.\nMichael Calore: Sure. Always happy to squeeze in these obscure musical references about some of the best-selling artists in history for you.\nLauren Goode: That's not obscure though. I know last week, was it last week or the week before, I said something about an obscure artist and you said, \"She's not obscure.\" Bob Marley is not obscure.Michael Calore: Right. What's your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: My recommendation is White Lotus, season 2 on HBO Max.\nMichael Calore: Never heard of it.\nLauren Goode: You've never ... Really?\nMichael Calore: No, I'm kidding.\nLauren Goode: I was going to say, we've got to get you up to speed. I have not watched the whole season yet. HBO is trickling them out week by week, so you can't really binge-watch it unless you wait several weeks to watch it all at once. I have watched five episodes, because that's what was available to the press when HBO handed out their digital screeners. There are only two that are available to broader audiences right now, but it's great. It's brilliant. It's created by Mike White. It revolves around a murder. Again, the very first episode you learn that multiple someones have been murdered, and you sort of just see a body floating by, but it's hard to tell who it is, and so then all of these characters are introduced. And White Lotus is the name of a resort chain. Last season was in Hawaii. This season is in Sicily, so a bunch of incredibly wealthy people are at the White Lotus Resort again. And it's an ensemble cast. It's like a handful of different couples, and they don't all know each other, but then they sort of interact in different ways throughout the season. And yeah, I would say this so far, this season doesn't feel quite as masterful as the first one. I think the first one was new and the concept was great. The writing was great. You sort of felt very invested in characters, whether they were the resort guests or people who actually worked at the resort, but the second season does maintain the element of escapism. That's makes it really fun to watch, and it's kind of like a soap opera, and there's all this sexual tension and total weirdness and this underlying darkness that you're just waiting to rear its ugly head. And I'm really enjoying it so far. I can't wait to watch the final two episodes.\nMichael Calore: You'll have to live toot them.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I will indeed have to live-toot them or boost others who are live-tooting about it. Are we going to start doing that for live events? Are we going to go cover a big event and be like, \"Are we doing a live toot?\"\nMichael Calore: I look forward to all of your toots, live or not, about the finale of White Lotus season 2. I should be caught up by then.\nLauren Goode: I look forward to your toots about Swedish psych pop. And Andrew, thanks again for joining us.\nAndrew Couts: Thanks so much for having me.\nLauren Goode: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find most of us on Mastodon and all of us on Twitter, because we're still there. Just check the show notes. We'll put our handles in. I guess we should probably start putting our Mastodon handles in.\nMichael Calore: We absolutely should.\nLauren Goode: Why not? Our producer is the excellent Boone Ashworth, who's sitting here wearing a wooly mammoth costume in the studio.\nMichael Calore: It's a Mastodon costume.\nLauren Goode: Oh, all right. We'll be back next week. Thanks for listening.\n[Gadget Lab outro theme music plays]","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/636c4a7a5323b9770a54b0e7\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/Demystifying-Mastodon-Gear-GettyImages-1424869787.jpg","author":"BY WIRED STAFF","title":"What You Should Know About Switching to Mastodon","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/gadget-lab-podcast-574\/","tags":["","GADGET LAB PODCAST","PODCASTS","TWITTER","SOCIAL MEDIA"]},{"date":"11.10.2022","summary":"One of the world\u2019s biggest crypto groups just voted to back its enigmatic founder. The only problem is, no one understands his plan.","post_content":"IT WAS A sense of disappointment that pushed Danish entrepreneur Rune Christensen to start his own crypto project. In the years after Bitcoin was created in 2009, he quickly became convinced of the \u201Cimmense potential of blockchain\u201D but was unimpressed by early projects: Most people were only out to turn a quick buck.\nIn 2014, Christensen set about trying to build \u201Csomething useful,\u201D he says, something that \u201Cmattered for the real world.\u201D The result was DAI, a stablecoin whose value doesn\u2019t fluctuate from hour to hour like a regular cryptocurrency but instead is pegged to the US dollar, giving people a way to make purchases safely.\nTo help govern the stablecoin, Christensen and cofounder Nikolai Mushegian (who is recently deceased) established MakerDAO, one of the earliest examples of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)\u2014a new type of entity with no central leadership. Unlike a traditional business, MakerDAO puts every important decision to a community vote, open to anyone who buys a special kind of token called MKR. It\u2019s a niche concept, but there are roughly 6,000 DAOs in operation\u2014and MakerDAO is one of the biggest, worth almost $6 billion at the height of the value of the MKR token.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nIn the spirit of decentralization\u2014a guiding principle of almost all blockchain-based projects\u2014Christensen says he always planned to step aside once the DAO had become self-sufficient, but when he tried, it was always rudderless in his absence. \u201CI went through this process over and over again,\u201D he says, \u201Calways thinking we just needed to get over the next hurdle.\u201D But eventually, Christensen realized that without someone to guide the ship, a power vacuum forms and the community begins to fracture.\nIn May, after an absence of at least three months, Christensen returned with a radical plan to set MakerDAO once and for all \u201Con a path toward a truly decentralized equilibrium.\u201D Known as Endgame, Christensen says it\u2019s his \u201Clast attempt to fix\u201D MakerDAO and a \u201Cmake or break moment.\u201D\nSo he asked DAO members to vote for a proposal that will mean existing departments will be disbanded and replaced with \u201CMetaDAOs\u201D\u2014mini-DAOs housed within the MakerDAO mothership\u2014and the project will reconfigure its finances. The goal is to \u201Cunbundle bureaucracy\u201D and protect the DAO from forces outside its control, says Christensen, setting the stage for long-term growth.\nA Rigged Vote and an Unintelligible Plan\nThe vote on the restructuring of MakerDAO took place over two weeks, between October 10 and October 24. The community faced a difficult choice: support the plan of MakerDAO\u2019s enigmatic cofounder, which few really understood, or embrace the imperfections of the status quo. They chose Christensen.\nGreg Di Prisco, who previously worked at the Maker Foundation (the entity responsible for kickstarting MakerDAO), goes as far as to say that Christensen is the only person to understand Endgame. \u201CI didn't vote, mainly because I find it incomprehensible and therefore couldn't go so far as to extend my explicit support,\u201D Di Prisco says. \u201CI can't even tell you what a MetaDAO is from a mechanical [or] practical perspective.\u201DThe success or failure of Endgame will say a lot about whether DAOs can ever function as intended: without leadership. Christensen hopes it will \u201Cshatter all expectations\u201D and bring about \u201Ca renaissance\u201D in the crypto industry by setting an example for others to follow.\nIronically, however, the vote itself called attention to the imbalance of power inside MakerDAO\u2014specifically, the outsize influence of Christensen. The proposal sailed through its poll with what looked like majority support (80 percent), but in reality \u201Cthere were only two voters that mattered,\u201D says Sébastien Derivaux, who handles asset and liability management for MakerDAO. That\u2019s Christensen, who is said to own roughly 10 percent of the total MKR supply, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which acquired a 6 percent share in 2018.\nOn paper, the system is decentralized, but low turnout means only 10 to 15 percent of voting power is typically recorded in any given poll, putting the power in the hands of whales like Christensen (and to a lesser extent Andreessen Horowitz). In a Twitter thread, Derivaux explained that the MakerDAO cofounder had a hand in almost three-quarters of the votes on the historic Endgame proposal.\n\u201CMakerDAO is very political. [Endgame] was pretty much forced through by one man\u2019s economic power,\u201D says Danny, a veteran community member and MakerDAO contributor, whose name has been changed to protect his anonymity. He claims Christensen\u2019s return has \u201Crecentralized\u201D the project and that it can no longer be described as a functioning DAO.\nKianga Daverington, founder of ACREinvest, a MakerDAO delegate (someone to whom people entrust their voting tokens), also believes the return of Christensen has damaged the DAO. She has written previously that MakerDAO \u201Cappears to be captured and entirely controlled\u201D by Christensen, whose return marks the end of a \u201Cbrief dynamic period of flourishing openness and organic decentralization of decisionmaking.\u201D\nDaverington also contests the characterization of VCs in some portions of the MakerDAO community as a detrimental force for centralization and of Christensen as the only person able to counteract their \u201Cevil\u201D designs, which she says \u201Ccouldn\u2019t be further from the truth on either count.\u201D\nAndreessen Horowitz, which delegates some of its voting tokens to ACREInvest, was against the redesign of MakerDAO. The firm declined to elaborate further on the \u201Corganizational risk\u201D described in its forum post but has suggested that Endgame will do little to address the DAO\u2019s structural problems.\nChristensen, for his part, is willing to admit he holds too much power, something he \u201Cwanted to avoid.\u201D \u201CBut I have no choice but to try to make it work \u2026 because I simply don\u2019t believe the community will come up with a solution that will last,\u201D he says. The only alternative would be to give up on MakerDAO entirely.\nA Cult of Personality\nEven ignoring the size of his MKR holdings, Christensen is quite able to whip up support for his designs from the wider MakerDAO community. Although he has his critics, Christensen is revered as one of the earliest pioneers of the decentralized finance movement and is well-respected for his capacity for abstract thought.\nSpeaking to Christensen, it\u2019s easy to understand why people are willing to gather in his corner, whether or not they understand his thinking. The unkempt hair and soft voice have a disarming effect and, even though we didn\u2019t follow everything he was saying, his enthusiasm and earnestness lends him credibility.Something on which everyone can agree, whether fans of Christensen or not, is that the existing governance system is in need of reform. \u201CThere are a lot of teams, and it is not always easy to get a sense of the value they are providing,\u201D says Derivaux, and MakerDAO is paralyzed by an inability to reach decisions quickly. Less clear is whether Endgame will resolve these problems.\n\u201CThe impact Endgame will have is really difficult to say,\u201D says Johnny_TVL, senior research analyst at Messari, a specialist crypto research firm. \u201CCertainly, if fully executed, it seems like it would adeptly decentralize the protocol. But given the complexity, it is unlikely to work exactly as advertised.\u201D\nTo characterize Endgame as complex is perhaps to put it too lightly. In a Substack post, Luca Prosperi, who works in lending oversight for MakerDAO, described Christensen\u2019s Endgame posts as \u201Cvery detailed, extremely articulated, unforgivingly frequent, and excruciatingly long.\u201D To comprehend the latest version of the plan, he says, a \u201CTolkien-esque glossary\u201D is required.\nDespite his doubts during the voting process, Di Prisco is willing to put faith in the MakerDAO founder, who he describes as \u201Csmart and honest.\u201D He says he has come to terms with the fact that, often, \u201Cthe founder is the only one who can really picture things end to end.\u201D\nChristensen admits he is probably the only one to grasp the Endgame proposal and its implications. \u201CIn some ways, I don\u2019t even understand it fully,\u201D he says. \u201CI can\u2019t predict all possible future paths.\u201D\n\u201CBut the current status quo is infinitely more complex; you can\u2019t see the wood for the trees. But with Endgame, things start to crystallize to a point where you can at least count the things you need to understand,\u201D says Christensen.\nA Reckoning for DAOs Everywhere\nAt the center of the conflict within the MakerDAO community are questions around whether complete decentralization can ever be achieved\u2014and if it\u2019s even a good idea.\nSome believe decentralization should be the DAO\u2019s single priority, as the only protection against the overreach of governments and corporations, while others are willing to compromise on decentralization to make DAI accessible to the largest possible audience.\nBut Danny says the debate has been hindered by \u201Ca real lack of intellectual rigor and consistency\u201D around the concept of decentralization, which has become a cliché used to signpost a general philosophy rather than a clearly defined objective.\nIn spite of their admiration for the spirit of the MakerDAO project, none of the community members that spoke to WIRED (with the exception of Daverington) claimed to be optimistic about the long-term viability of DAOs as a model for organizing human effort. Even Christensen says he had almost given up on the concept, until Endgame reignited his belief.\n\u201CI think DAOs, up to this point, are pretty much a failure,\u201D says Di Prisco, who suggests that the problem has to do with \u201Cthe architecture of the protocols and expectations people have of governance.\u201D\nDanny, who is equally pessimistic, says the biggest problem is the failure to get enough people to vote\u2014and asking them to vote on highly complex proposals. The result is a system that pushes people to fall in line behind a figurehead, like Christensen, and therefore begins to resemble a traditional business ever more closely.\nThe fundamental question is whether DAOs can be organized in such a way that the best ideas rise to the top, but Danny says that\u2019s simply not the case here. \u201CMakerDAO is as far from a meritocracy of ideas as you can get.\u201D","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/636c3adf32968364ac1a7b4c\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/MakerDAO-Founder-Ensnared-By-His-Own-Creation-Business-1227074485.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"This Billion-Dollar Crypto Collective Is Tearing Itself Apart","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/makerdao-rune-christensen-decentralize\/","tags":["","CRYPTOCURRENCY","BLOCKCHAIN","FINANCE"]},{"date":"11.09.2022","summary":"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX opens opportunities for rival exchange Binance\u2014and raises questions about the sector\u2019s sustainability.","post_content":"THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST crypto exchange, Binance, has walked away from a deal to acquire its troubled archrival, FTX, leaving the smaller company on the brink of collapse after a surge of withdrawals.\nLed by Sam Bankman-Fried, one of the crypto industry\u2019s most well-regarded figures, FTX was until recently thought to be in fine shape. In January, the company raised $400 million from Softbank and others to reach a $32 billion valuation, and only last month it was talking about ambitious acquisition plans of its own.\nBut yesterday FTX suddenly suspended customer withdrawals (a precursor to many a crypto collapse), and the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, announced on Twitter that FTX had \u201Casked for our help\u201D and a rescue deal had been reached.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nFinancial Advisor Answers Money Questions From Twitter\nIn his own thread, Bankman-Fried said that customers\u2019 money was now safe and withdrawals would be processed in time. \u201CA *huge* thank you to CZ, Binance, and all of our supporters,\u201D he wrote. \u201CCZ has done, and will continue to do, an incredible job of building out the global crypto ecosystem, and creating a freer economic world.\u201D\nAfter a year in which trust in crypto companies has already been torn to shreds by the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, lender Celsius, and the Terra-Luna stablecoin, another high-profile failure was the last thing the industry needed. FTX seemed to have squeaked through its own crisis.\nBut today Binance tweeted that the deal was off, citing the results of corporate due diligence and news reports of mishandling of customer funds at FTX.\nX content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nEt Tu, Binance\nThe starting point of FTX\u2019s troubles was July of last year, when Binance, an early investor in the exchange, sold its stake in its rival for $2.1 billion worth of FTT, a token launched by FTX. At the time, the move was seen as a logical parting of ways; a rift had formed between Bankman-Fried and CZ, who had differing views on the approach to regulating crypto.\nThe problems for FTX only bubbled to the surface last week with a report from CoinDesk, which appeared to show that the balance sheet of Alameda Research, FTX\u2019s sister company, was choked up with billions of dollars in FTT.\nThe discovery raised questions about FTX and Alameda\u2019s financial exposure to FTT, which cannot be readily turned back into cash. (The specifics of the relationship between Alameda and FTX have long been unclear.)In response, CZ dropped a bombshell on Twitter: Binance would sell off its entire FTT holding. He claimed the intention was to sell \u201Cin a way that minimizes market impact,\u201D but the announcement led to a steep drop in the price of FTT (the token has lost almost 90 percent of its value) and a surge in withdrawals at FTX as customers began to panic about the safety of their crypto.\nBankman-Fried initially denied rumors of insolvency on November 7, claiming that \u201Ca competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors\u201D and that \u201CFTX is fine.\u201D (These tweets have since been deleted.) It later became clear the company was scrambling to secure a bailout.\nCZ has denied that he deliberately created a liquidity crisis at FTX\u2014\u201CI spend my energy building, not fighting,\u201D he tweeted on November 7\u2014but Tim Mangnall, whose company Capital Block has consulted for both Binance and FTX, says this was a \u201Cshrewd\u201D business maneuver by CZ, one that allowed him to \u201Cbuy one of his biggest competitors for pennies on the dollar.\u201D\nAll Hail CZ, King of Crypto\nBinance has now rejected that deal. The crisis at FTX likely reinforces its rival\u2019s position as the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance is already larger, by trading volume, than a clutch of its nearest competitors (Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bitfinex, Huobi, and FTX) combined.\nBinance will now likely hold greater control over the kinds of coins that are widely listed for purchase. By the same token, the influence of CZ, already one of the most prominent figures in the crypto world, will also be magnified in debates around policy and regulation.\nFor the portion of the community that believes crypto should stand for decentralization, the merging of two of the world\u2019s largest exchanges will also be cause for concern. Decentralization is all about the even distribution of power and eliminating single points of failure, but the fall of FTX supports neither ambition.\nAfter Binance's rescue plan was first announced, the prices of bitcoin and ether fell by more than 10 percent, wiping out more than $60 billion from the market. They may now fall further.\nThe implosion of FTX will also raise questions about what should be done to protect crypto owners in the future. One proposal from CZ is that all exchanges should provide transparent \u201Cproof of reserves\u201D\u2014in other words, clearly demonstrate they have enough cash on hand to fund customer withdrawals. In a tweet, he promised that Binance will take up this policy \u201Csoon.\u201D\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, expressed sympathy for FTX but also pointed to \u201Crisky business practices\u201D and \u201Cconflicts of interest\u201D that left the company exposed\u2014something that, presumably, transparency requirements would also remedy. Separately, Armstrong moved to dismiss concerns that Coinbase might find itself in a similar liquidity crunch: \u201CWe hold all assets dollar for dollar,\u201D he wrote on Twitter.\nBut others say this latest dance with disaster is evidence that people should not store their wealth with exchanges. \u201CWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a reminder of the importance of crypto custody,\u201D says Pascal Gauthier, CEO at Ledger, which makes wallets to allow people to manage their own crypto. \u201CYou don\u2019t own your crypto unless you use self-custody.\u201D\nUpdated 11-9-2022, 5:30 pm EST: This article has been updated to reflect Binance\u2019s statement that it would not acquire FTX after all.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/636bf17fab9086067e9f2685\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/FTX-Is-Dead-And-This-Is-Only-The-Beginning-Business-1053427234.jpg","author":"BY JOEL KHALILI","title":"What the Hell Happened to FTX?","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ftx-collapse-binance-crypto-deal\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","BLOCKCHAIN","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]},{"date":"11.09.2022","summary":"Hunting down crypto criminals is a dying art as law enforcement officers jump in-house.","post_content":"IN THE COURSE of a decade as a special agent with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Tigran Gambaryan\u2069 has seen them all.

Instead, years after it was torn offline, it's proven to be the IRS\u2019s gift that keeps on giving.\nOn Monday, the US Department of Justice announced that a Georgia man named James Zhong has pleaded guilty to wire fraud nine years after stealing more than 50,000 bitcoins from the Silk Road. As part of his plea agreement, Zhong has forfeited that massive stash of bitcoins to the DOJ\u2014a sum that, at the time of the coins' seizure in late 2021, would have been the biggest-ever Justice Department seizure not only of cryptocurrency but of currency of any kind. The bitcoins were ultimately found stored on what\u2019s described in court records as a \u201Csingle-board computer\u201D hidden in a popcorn can, along with more than $600,000 in cash and precious metals, all held in a safe under the floorboards of a bathroom closet in Zhong\u2019s home.\nThe newly revealed case represents yet another notch in the belt for IRS Criminal Investigations, or IRS-CI, which over the past several years has used\u2014very often in partnership with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis\u2014cryptocurrency tracing techniques that have led to record-breaking troves of ill-gotten bitcoins and to the alleged hackers and money launderers who amassed them. In fact, Zhong is the second Silk Road hacker to turn over a billion-dollar cache of coins to the IRS-CI, after another unnamed individual agreed the previous year to forfeit nearly 70,000 bitcoins he'd stolen from the drug market\u2014a record-breaking, even larger collection of coins that was worth $1 billion at Bitcoin's lower exchange rate at the time. Both those records were again broken earlier this year by IRS-CI's case against two alleged money launderers in New York accused of pocketing $4.5 billion in cryptocurrency stolen from the Bitfinex exchange.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\n\"Thanks to state-of-the-art cryptocurrency tracing and good old-fashioned police work, law enforcement located and recovered this impressive cache of crime proceeds,\" wrote US Attorney Damian Williams, a prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, in a statement about the latest indictment and 10-figure seizure. \"This case shows that we won\u2019t stop following the money, no matter how expertly hidden, even to a circuit board in the bottom of a popcorn tin.\u201D\nThe hidden safe where investigators found a popcorn tin containing a storage device with Zhong\u2019s $3.36 billion in Bitcoin.\nPHOTOGRAPH: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEAccording to an IRS-CI affidavit detailing Zhong's theft of the 50,000-plus bitcoins from the Silk Road, he appears to have found a vulnerability in that dark-web market that in 2012 allowed him to somehow pull more coins out of accounts he created there than he had deposited. The affidavit describes how he registered a succession of accounts on the site with names like \"thetormentor\" and \"dubba,\" deposited a sum of coins into the Bitcoin wallets for each account, and then made repeated withdrawals of the entire sums held there within a single second to multiply his money several times over. This apparently exploited a bug in the Silk Road that allowed those rapid-fire withdrawals without first confirming that the requested money still existed in a user's account. \"In this fashion, [Zhong], using each of the fraud accounts, moved at least approximately 50,000 Bitcoin out of Silk Road in just a few days,\" reads the affidavit, which was signed by IRS-CI special agent Trevor McAleenan.\nOver the nine years that followed, Zhong appears to have left that massive windfall almost entirely unspent\u2014perhaps for fear that cashing it out into traditional currency would attract the attention of law enforcement. But even that epic restraint appears to have been in vain, as IRS-CI investigators nonetheless traced Zhong's coins to his accounts on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange, which revealed his identity. Zhong's case closely mirrors the story of the earlier Silk Road hacker, referred to in court documents only as Individual X, who similarly exploited a vulnerability in the Silk Road to take nearly 70,000 bitcoins from the site and hold them for more than seven years. But, perhaps due to the vagaries of negotiations over massive cryptocurrency fortunes, no charges against Individual X have been publicly revealed. Zhong, by contrast, now faces a wire fraud conviction that carries as much as 20 years in prison.\nThe Silk Road was torn down by a massive law enforcement operation in late 2013, leading to the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the site's creator, who was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to pay $183 million in restitution. In yet another bizarre twist, however, a portion of the seized 70,000 bitcoins taken from the Silk Road by Individual X were applied toward Ulbricht's debt, paying it off in full in exchange for his agreement not to lay any claim to the remaining money.\nUsing bitcoins stolen from the Silk Road to pay off the restitution of that site's creator may seem like a strange turn of events. But in an era when IRS-CI cryptocurrency seizures regularly pours billions of dollars into the US Treasury, there seems to be plenty to go around.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/636958c63505151fbc0b01cb\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/New-Silk-Road-Bitcoin-Bust-Security-GettyImages-653852096.jpg","author":"BY ANDY GREENBERG","title":"IRS Seizes Another Silk Road Hacker\u2019s $3.36 Billion Bitcoin Stash","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/silk-road-bitcoin-seizure-james-zhong\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","CRIME","SILK ROAD","DARK WEB","CRYPTOCURRENCY"]},{"date":"11.04.2022","summary":"The region is called \u2018Silicon Gorge\u2019 for good reason \u2013 and that reputation didn\u2019t emerge by chance\u2026","post_content":"WHEN A SILICON Valley giant expanded to the UK forty years ago, it sparked a quiet revolution. It chose Bristol for its home-from-home, and in the coming decades, a huge influx of tech companies decided to follow suit. So much so that the Bristol-Swindon-Gloucester triangle acquired a new moniker: \u2018Silicon Gorge.'\nIt all started in 1972, when the top team at Fairchild Semiconductor International \u2013 a San Jose-based microchip pioneer whose founders later created Intel \u2013 found themselves attracted to Bristol for its reputation as a place of innovation. Not microchip innovation, admittedly, but aeronautical innovation \u2013 an industry that stretched back to 1910. There was a certain poetry at play: the organisation to which Fairchild Semiconductor belonged had started life as Fairchild Aircraft.\nIn 1978, as a direct result of Fairchild\u2019s move to the city, the pioneering silicon chip developer Inmos launched in Bristol. It went on to attract over £200m of investment from the UK government over the following six years, and shone a light on the region as a serious, up-and-coming tech player. Today, the South West\u2019s tech scene is in rude health \u2013 for \u201Cdeep tech\u201D in particular. Take XMOS, a semiconductor company specialising in intelligent processor solutions for the Internet of Things. \u201CInmos was to Bristol what Intel was to Silicon Valley,\u201D reflects XMOS\u2019 chief executive, Mark Lippett. \u201CThe creation of that company sparked a long running ecosystem that now feeds off itself. It is always looking ahead and moving forward.\u201D\nAs defined by Boston Consulting Group, deep tech focuses on \u201Clarge and fundamental issues,\u201D that often tackle scientific or engineering challenges requiring lengthy periods of research and development plus large sums of capital. Chip design is archetypal \u201Cdeep tech\u201D because of the huge impact these products have on our everyday lives. But the sector is far broader than that. It spans advanced materials and manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, blockchain, robotics and electronics.\nThe tech credentials of Bristol and the surrounding region are clear from the participants in WIRED\u2019s Trailblazer programme. In partnership with HSBC UK, this initiative focuses on medium-sized companies making an impact across the globe. And it\u2019s no surprise that tech-driven firms are well represented. Alongside XMOS, you\u2019ll find Rovco, for example, which provides underwater surveying for science and industry, and Immersive Labs, which trains organisations to take on cybersecurity threats.\nCentral to the South West\u2019s innovation scene are the universities that feed it and the hubs and incubators that sustain it. In many cases the two are intrinsically linked. Science Creates, for example, is a deep tech incubator partnered with the University of Bristol. With a physical footprint of 45,000 sq ft, it supports more than 100 companies that collectively raised £18.4m in 2021 alone. Or take SETsquared, a start-up accelerator run collectively by the universities of Bristol, Bath, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey which has supported over 4,000 entrepreneurs. TechCrunch reports that since 2002 it has raised a funding total of £1.8bn.\nFive of WIRED\u2019s Trailblazers \u2013 Rovco, XMOS, aerospace company Space Forge, touchless tech pioneer Ultraleap and data intelligence firm RipJar \u2013 were founded by University of Bristol and Bath alumni. XMOS\u2019 Mark Lippett sees this as an important trend. \u201CThe deep tech scene fuelled by the universities here has become a catalyst for business growth,\u201D he says. \u201CThere is a legacy of interesting and successful companies set up by alumni from local universities. This, among other things, means that people want to stick around the area after they have finished their degrees, resulting in a lot of talent retention and recycling.\u201D\nLippett also highlights the city\u2019s other major talent draw: its parallel reputation as a creative hub. \u201CThere is so much untapped potential at the intersection of creativity and science here,\u201D he says. \u201CBringing some of the region\u2019s creativity into the tech side of things and vice versa will result in a cross-fertilisation of ideas and an opportunity to think more creatively when it comes to using and applying technology.\u201D\nIndeed, Bristol and the South West is an epicentre of creativity. As HSBC UK\u2019s Deputy Regional Director for the South, Matt Wesley, points out: \u2018\u2018Beyond its entrenched artistic spirit \u2013 famously it\u2019s the region that produced Massive Attack and Banksy \u2013 it is the chosen location for some of the best-known creative brands and businesses in the UK. This makes it a hugely exciting region to find some of the UK\u2019s most pioneering firms.\u2019\u2019\nThis creative legacy stems in large part from the BBC\u2019s Natural History Unit having based itself in Bristol since its formation in 1957. It kickstarted a surge of digital, branding and design enterprises putting down roots in the region. One of the best known is Aardman, the award-winning animation studio famed for hit films, series, advertising, and now games and interactive entertainment. Its roster includes much-loved productions such as Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and Morph, all made using clay models and stop-motion. The studio continues to innovate with digital projects such as its first in-house CGI series, Lloyd of the Flies, and The Grand Getaway; a new Wallace & Gromit VR adventure for Meta Quest launching in 2023. \u201CThere is a great culture here of tapping into local ideas and innovation,\u201D says Aardman managing director, Sean Clarke. \u201CBut when you talk to founders in this space about Bristol, there are additional factors attracting them here. It has long been an appealing location for the film and TV community thanks to the BBC\u2019s Natural History Unit. And the transport links are very good. We are close to London and Bristol airport connects us to Europe. We are also seeing a lot of artistic people relocating to areas like Bristol from London to get more bang for their buck, so it is an increasingly good location in terms of access to a creative and diverse workforce. And as a values-led organisation, attracting and nurturing talent from all backgrounds is incredibly important to us.\u201D\nThe maturation of Bristol\u2019s creative sector, bolstered by the deep tech scene it has been cultivating for the past four decades, has furnished the city with a bright outlook. It\u2019s now the fifth-fastest growing tech city in the UK according to the Digital Economy Council\u2019s Levelling Up Power Tech League report. A 2021 government forecast named three companies in the area that are likely to achieve unicorn valuations. One of them was the ecommerce fulfilment business Huboo, which says that it only sees the region going from strength to strength. \u201CThis area has always been a success story, but until recently certain industries tended to dominate,\u201D says its CEO Martin Bysh. \u201CNow, it has a diverse tech scene that spans multiple sectors and has an incredible sense of momentum. But what hasn\u2019t changed is something that has served the area well for decades: it\u2019s simply a great place to live.\u201DThe WIRED Trailblazer programme was created by WIRED Consulting and sponsored by HSBC UK.\nTo discuss your business ambitions with HSBC UK, click here \nTo find out more about WIRED Consulting, click hereThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","post_cover":null,"author":null,"title":"How The UK\u2019s South West Became A \u2018Deep Tech\u2019 Powerhouse","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/how-the-uks-south-west-became-a-deep-tech-powerhouse-hsbc-uk\/","tags":["","PROMOTION","WIRED TRAILBLAZERS","WIRED CONSULTING"]},{"date":"11.02.2022","summary":"For years, the platform has funded a project that's meant to create a better, decentralized online experience.

A friend recommended that during his stay he meet up with a contact from their hometown who now lived in Bangkok. The man's name was Alexandre Cazes. Desjardins decided to pay him a visit.\nCazes, he found, lived in an unremarkable, midsize house in a gated community in the Thai capital, but the baby-faced Canadian in his early twenties seemed to be doing well for himself. He had invested early in Bitcoin, he told Desjardins, and it had paid off.\nHis biggest financial problem seemed to be that he now had more cash than he could deal with. He alluded to having sold bitcoins to Russian mafia contacts in Bangkok. A foreigner depositing the resulting voluminous bundles of Thai baht at a bank would raise red flags with local regulators, he worried. So instead he had piles of bills accumulating around his home, even hidden in recesses in the walls.\nFEATURED VIDEO\n \u201CThere was money everywhere,\u201D Desjardins remembers. \u201CYou open a drawer, and you find money.\u201D\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nDespite Cazes' liquidity issues and his somewhat alarming mention of the Russian mob, Desjardins couldn't see any evidence that his strange new acquaintance was involved in anything overtly criminal. He didn't use any drugs; he seemed to barely drink beer. Cazes was friendly and intelligent, if socially strange and emotionally \u201Cvery cold,\u201D like someone going through the motions of human interaction rather than doing so naturally. \u201CIt was all logic,\u201D Desjardins says, \u201Cones and zeros.\u201D He did note that his new friend, while otherwise generous and good-natured, had ideas about women and sex that struck him as very conservative, bordering on misogynistic.\nDuring that first visit, the two men discussed Desjardins' idea for a new ecommerce website. Cazes appeared interested, and Desjardins suggested they work on it together.\nBack in Quebec around Christmas of that year, Cazes met with Desjardins again, this time to hear a full business pitch. After no more than 15 minutes of discussion, Cazes was in. He impressed Desjardins by spending $150,000 without hesitation on a web domain for their business, not even bothering to haggle with the seller.In another pleasant surprise, Cazes also paid a six-figure legal bill that Desjardins had racked up in a dispute with another business. He turned out to be a coding savant too; Desjardins had planned to hire a team of coders, but Cazes quickly did most of the initial programming for their fledgling site single-handedly.\nAs they worked to get their business off the ground, Desjardins could see that Cazes was richer than he had first estimated. Desjardins learned that his partner was in the process of buying a villa in Cyprus and making some sort of real estate investment in Antigua. When Desjardins next visited Bangkok, Cazes picked him up at the airport in a dark gray Lamborghini Aventador.\nDesjardins pointed out that there was nowhere in the supercar to fit his large suitcase. Cazes told him to get in anyway and gamely struggled with the luggage until it fit onto his guest's lap. Desjardins remembers seeing the suitcase scratch parts of the Lamborghini's interior, but Cazes didn't seem to care. In fact, he didn't seem to have much emotional connection to the car at all; he didn't even know how to use its radio. Desjardins thought Cazes appeared to own it out of a sense that it was the socially correct way to display his wealth.\nAs they left the airport, Cazes asked Desjardins whether he'd ever been in a Lamborghini before. He responded that he had not. Within seconds, Desjardins was flattened against the Aventador's passenger seat as his eccentric friend rocketed them down the Bangkok highway at more than 150 miles per hour.\nIN LATE NOVEMBER 2016, just before Thanksgiving, Grant Rabenn was wrapping up his caseload in his office and preparing for the holiday when he got a call from Miller. \u201CHey, Grant,\u201D Miller said. \u201CI think I\u2019ve got something big that we should talk about.\u201D\nThey met at the Starbucks a block from Fresno's courthouse. Miller explained what his tipster had told him: In AlphaBay's earliest days online, long before it gained its hundreds of thousands of users or came under the microscope of law enforcement, the market's creator had made a critical, almost laughable security mistake. Everyone who registered on the site's forums at the time had received a welcome email, sent via the site's Tor-protected server. But due to a misconfiguration in the server's setup, the message's metadata plainly revealed the email address of the person who sent it\u2014Pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com\u2014along with the IP address of the server, which placed it in the Netherlands.\nThe error had quickly been fixed, but only after the tipster had registered and received the welcome email. The source had kept it archived for two years as AlphaBay grew into the biggest dark-web market in history.\nAnd now they had given it to Miller. It seemed that even the figure Rabenn once thought of as \u201Cthe Michael Jordan of the dark web\u201D was capable of elementary security errors\u2014with permanent consequences.\nRabenn received Miller's revelation coolly. He'd heard before from overexcited agents whose incredible leads led to dead ends or hoaxes. Surely, he thought, if his little team in Fresno had these clues, someone else in the US government must be miles ahead of them. But they nonetheless decided to drop everything and follow the tip.There was, in fact, more to the source's lead, all of which could be corroborated with a few Google searches. The Pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com address also appeared on a French-language social media site, Skyrock.com. There, someone named \u201CAlex\u201D had posted photos of himself from 2008 and 2009, dressed in baggy shirts covered in images of dollar bills and jewels and wearing crisp new baseball caps with a silver pendant hanging from his neck. In one picture he'd written his hip hop handle, \u201CRAG MIND,\u201D at the top of the image in the style of a debut rap album. The words on his shirt read \u201CHUSTLE KING.\u201D\nA dating profile the man had posted to the site identified his hometown, Trois-Rivières in the French-Canadian province of Quebec, and his age at the time, 17. So the \u201C91\u201D in his email address was his birth year. If this was indeed AlphaBay's founder, he would have been 23 at the time of the market's creation.\nNothing about this young French-Canadian hip hop wannabe matched Rabenn and Miller's sense of the kingpin known as Alpha02. Had all of the allusions to Russia and Russian-language snippets been a ruse? Based on the IP address included in the tipster's email, the site's forums, at least, seemed to be based in Western Europe.\nTo Miller and Rabenn, the theory that \u201CAlex\u201D was Alpha02 seemed outlandish at first. But the deeper they looked, the more plausible it became. The young Quebecer had used his Pimp_alex_91 email address years earlier on a French-language technology forum called Comment Ça Marche\u2014\u201CHow It Works.\u201D He had signed his messages with his full name: Alexandre Cazes.\nSearching for that name, the investigators came upon a more recent LinkedIn profile for a decidedly more adult Alex, sans hip hop outfit, advertising himself as a web programmer and the founder of a Quebec-based hosting and web design company called EBX Technologies. His photo showed an unremarkable-looking businessman in a gray suit and white shirt with no tie. He had a round face with a cleft chin, slightly thinning hair in the front, and an innocent openness to his expression.\nCazes listed his location as Quebec, Canada, but they could see from his social media connections that he seemed to actually be based in Thailand. Further digging on social media revealed Facebook accounts for Cazes' fiancée, a pretty Thai woman named Sunisa Thapsuwan. A telling photo on a relative's profile showed Cazes in a suit and sunglasses, standing next to a dark gray Lamborghini Aventador.\nDigging deeper still, they found the most telling clues of all. On Comment Ça Marche and another programming forum called Dream in Code were older profiles for Cazes that had been deleted, but they were preserved on the Internet Archive. Years earlier, it seemed, he had written on those forums under another username: Alpha02.\nWITHIN DAYS, RABENN and Miller knew their lead was solid. They also knew the case was too big for them to take on alone. They decided to bring their findings to the FBI field office in Sacramento, a much larger outpost just a few hours' drive north with significantly more cybercrime expertise and resources than their small Fresno office. It turned out that the agents in Sacramento had been tracking AlphaBay from its inception. Nonetheless, Miller's tip was new information to them.Rabenn brought on the office's assistant US attorney, Paul Hemesath, as an investigative partner. The two had been friendly for years; Hemesath, an older and more deliberate prosecutor, had the air of a college professor, and he balanced out Rabenn's aggressive run-and-gun approach. Hemesath in turn asked for help from the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section at Justice Department headquarters\u2014the office in Washington, DC, where a small army of cybercrime-focused agents and computer forensics analysts was based.\nAs they assembled their team, Miller and Rabenn began the delicate process of \u201Cdeconfliction,\u201D figuring out whether other agencies and task forces around the country had their own open cases on Alpha02. Again and again, Rabenn heard that another team in another city was investigating AlphaBay but had made no real headway. None appeared to recognize the name Alexandre Cazes.\nAgainst all odds, Rabenn began to realize, his little office in the Central Valley was perhaps closer than anyone in the world to cracking the dark web's deepest mystery. Soon they would find themselves at the vanguard of its biggest global manhunt.\nCHAPTER 4\nTHAILAND\nIF CAZES HAD moved halfway around the world to Bangkok to run AlphaBay beyond the reach of Western law enforcement, he'd chosen, by some measures, exactly the wrong destination.\nFor more than half a century, the US government has had an enormous presence in Thailand. Even before the DEA was founded in 1973, a US agency called the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs had stationed a field office in Bangkok. American agents had long been sent there to disrupt the flow of so-called China White heroin from the opium-growing Golden Triangle region that covers parts of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. In the late 1950s that triangle produced half of the world's heroin supply and fed an epidemic of addicted US soldiers in Vietnam in the '60s and '70s\u2014a problem that made quashing the Thai drug trade one of the DEA's earliest and highest priorities. Fifty years later, Bangkok remains one of the largest and most active DEA offices in the world, the regional headquarters for the entire East Asia operations of the US law enforcement agency that has more overseas agents than any other.For Jen Sanchez, it was also a plum assignment: beautiful weather, low cost of living, incredible food, and not particularly dangerous\u2014relative to other DEA hot spots, anyway.\nSanchez, a 26-year veteran of the DEA in her mid-fifties with white hair cut to her shoulders and a zero-bullshit, profanity-laden approach to conversation, felt she'd earned her coveted Bangkok job. She'd spent years in Mexico City investigating money laundering followed by a stint in Texas, where her work led to the arrest of three Mexican governors for taking bribes from the Zetas drug cartel and embezzling from their own state governments. In that case, dubbed Operation Politico Junction, she'd tracked the governors' dirty money into the businesses they'd bought to launder it, along with mansions, luxury cars, and private aircraft. In total, Sanchez had signed affidavits for seized assets worth more than $90 million. She'd come to relish the righteous thrill of bankrupting criminals who had spent their lives amassing ill-gotten wealth. And since much of that money ended up in DEA coffers, it hadn't exactly hurt her career, either. As she modestly put it, \u201CI paid for myself.\u201D\nBy December 2016, Sanchez had been in Thailand for nine months, mostly helping to track the financing for violent Islamic movements in the country's south. Then one day, at the Bangkok DEA office\u2014situated in the US embassy, a white stone building with a canal surrounding its foundation and a grass lawn where 6-foot-long monitor lizards emerged from the foliage in the evening\u2014her boss told her they had a visitor: a DEA official who was set to give them a presentation on virtual currency.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay companion newsletter. \nSanchez didn't know anything about virtual currency. Nor, with just a few years left until retirement, did she particularly care to learn about it. But she listened politely throughout the presentation. Only at the end of the session did the visiting agent truly get her attention: He mentioned, almost in passing, that the DEA had recently found a lead on the administrator of the world's biggest dark-web market and that he seemed to be right there in Thailand.\nSanchez had heard of Silk Road. She asked whether this site was as big as that legendary black market. The agent responded that it was at least three or four times the size of Silk Road, and growing. \u201CHoly shit,\u201D Sanchez thought to herself. The biggest dark-web kingpin in history was in her backyard? The scale of the money laundering alone would be enormous.\n\u201CHe's going to have stuff,\u201D she remembers thinking. And she wanted to be the one to track down those assets and seize them.\nAnother group of agents in Bangkok had been assigned to handle the AlphaBay case. Sanchez's own supervisor, to her constant frustration, seemed more interested in busting small-time dealers on the tourist beaches of Pattaya than in big-game, long-term investigations. But Sanchez was not about to be left out of what she suspected might be one of the largest seizures of cash and property\u2014virtual or otherwise\u2014in the history of the DEA in Thailand. As soon as the presentation was over and the visiting agent left, Sanchez walked into her boss's office, pointed a finger at him, and told him she wanted AlphaBay.\nSANCHEZ GOT HER wish. She soon found herself on a series of sometimes bewildering conference calls among all the different agencies now hunting Cazes across a dozen time zones. Those calls included Rabenn, Miller, Hemesath, and the Sacramento FBI team, who laid out AlphaBay's basic mechanics and use of cryptocurrency.As Sanchez began to get a sense of the full extent of the massive commerce in hard drugs that AlphaBay now facilitated on a daily basis, she became incensed. The US opioid crisis was, by that time, in full swing; 42,000 Americans had died of opiate overdoses in 2016, more than in any year on record. That surge was due in part to an influx of fentanyl, the opium derivative as much as 100 times stronger than morphine. And here this 25-year-old French-Canadian was running a massive open-air heroin and fentanyl bazaar in public view? She was haunted by the thought that every day AlphaBay was left online, anyone, even children, could order fentanyl from the site, receive it in the mail, and die of an overdose in a matter of hours. \nIn one call with Miller in Fresno, she swore they would have AlphaBay offline and Cazes behind bars in less than six months. \u201CI'm going to take his shit, and he is going to go to jail, and we're going to get him in Florence supermax,\u201D she remembers telling Miller, referencing the prison where Ross Ulbricht was then serving his life sentence. \u201CI want this kid gone.\u201D\nNow that Sanchez had joined the AlphaBay investigation, she was working under a new boss in Bangkok: a 47-year-old, Puerto Rico\u2013born DEA agent named Wilfredo Guzman. Guzman had started his career hunting drug-laden speedboats off the coast of Puerto Rico and had risen through the agency's ranks following a series of massive Caribbean and South American cases. Now, as a supervisor in the Bangkok office, he prioritized, above all else, maintaining a hand-in-glove relationship with the Thai police's DEA equivalent, known as the Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB). Doing so required near-constant late-night business dinners of painfully spicy food, drunken banquets, and karaoke outings, belting out John Denver lyrics onstage with high-ranking Bangkok cops.\nThe Royal Thai Police have a far-from-sterling record when it comes to drug trafficking and corruption. For some in the agency, shakedowns of petty drug dealers are understood to be a perk of the job. One RTP official named Thitisan Utthanaphon had earned the nickname Joe Ferrari for his collection of sports cars of mysterious provenance. He would later be caught in a leaked video suffocating a suspected meth dealer to death alongside six fellow cops.\nSo when Robert Miller asked Guzman in the agency's Bangkok office for help in hunting Cazes, Guzman brought it to his most trusted contact at the NSB, Colonel Pisal Erb-Arb, who led the agency's Bangkok Intelligence Center. Pisal was a spry, fatherly officer in his mid-fifties who frequently used his unassuming look as a balding middle-aged dad to take on undercover assignments. He had assembled a small team known for its squeaky-clean, by-the-book investigative work, as well as for Pisal's rare practice of advancing female agents.\nAlmost immediately, Guzman, Pisal, and the NSB team got to work tracking down their new target. Starting with just Cazes' name and a telephone number, they began to map out his properties: one home in a quiet gated community that he visited intermittently\u2014what they came to call his \u201Cbachelor pad\u201D or \u201Csafe house\u201D\u2014and another in his wife's name in a gated neighborhood on the other side of town, where he seemed to work and sleep. He had bought and was remodeling a third home, a $3 million mansion, farther on the outskirts of Bangkok.Soon the investigators were shadowing Cazes' every move around the city. The Thais were particularly fascinated to discover his Lamborghini, a supercar that cost nearly $1 million, as well as his Porsche Panamera and BMW motorcycle, all of which he drove at speeds well above 100 miles an hour whenever Bangkok traffic allowed.\nFollowing Cazes proved to be a moderate challenge: He frequently zoomed away from the agents tailing his sports cars on stretches of unbroken highway or lost them while snaking between trucks and tuk-tuks on his motorcycle. Pisal used a bit of personal tradecraft to plant a GPS tracker on Cazes' Porsche, posing as a drunk and collapsing next to the car in a parking garage, then affixing the device to its undercarriage. The police tried attaching a similar tracking beacon to the Lamborghini but found that the car's chassis rode so low to the ground that their gadget wouldn't fit. They resorted to tracking Cazes' iPhone instead, triangulating its position from cellular towers.\nAs Pisal's team began to assemble a detailed picture of Cazes' daily life, they were struck by how aboveboard it all seemed. He was a \u201Chomebody,\u201D as one agent put it, spending entire days without stepping outside. When he did leave his home during the day, he would go to the bank or his Thai language classes downtown, or take his wife out to restaurants or the mall. He lived, as Pisal put it using an English phrase commonly adopted by Thais, a \u201Cchill-chill\u201D life of leisure.\nCould their too-good-to-be-true tip have been some sort of elaborate misdirection? Was someone just trying to frame Cazes, to use him as a patsy?\nIt soon became apparent to Guzman and the Thai police that Cazes did have one very significant secret in his nondigital life: He was a womanizer. He frequently ventured out in the evenings to pick up dates\u2014from a 7-Eleven, from the mall, from his language class\u2014and take them to his bachelor pad, or else to love motels. These encounters were businesslike and brief. By the end of the night, Cazes would be back at home with his wife.\nSo-called sexpats\u2014foreigners using their wealth to live out polyamorous fantasies\u2014were common in Thailand. And as scandalous as Cazes' affairs might have been, there was no law against philandering. Still, the Thais needed little convincing that Cazes must be some form of crime boss. At one point the surveillance team trailed him to a restaurant called Sirocco on the roof of Bangkok's Lebua hotel; 63 floors up, it claimed to offer the highest alfresco dining in the world, with two Michelin stars and $2,400 bottles of wine on the menu.\nWhen Cazes and a group of friends left the restaurant, the cops entered and spoke to Sirocco's management, demanding the entire day's receipts to obscure whose bill they were hunting for. Including wine and lavish tips, they found that Cazes had spent no less than 1.3 million baht\u2014nearly $40,000\u2014in a single meal for his entourage, an amount that flabbergasted even the agents accustomed to tracking high-rolling drug kingpins.\nDrug lords who never touched narcotics themselves or directly carried out crimes were nothing new to the NSB agents. They were used to the notion that the cleaner a suspect's hands were, the more senior the position they likely held in a drug trafficking syndicate. But those high-ranking bosses often met with associates who were connected to hands-on crimes or were at least a step or two removed from them.Cazes' criminality, by contrast, seemed to be channeled entirely through the opaque aperture of the dark web, safely behind the veil of Bitcoin's blockchain. In the physical world, his hands were cleaner than those of any kingpin they'd ever encountered.\nAt times, this perfect veneer led even the US investigators to doubt themselves. Sure, Cazes seemed to have slipped up once, years ago, when he left that Pimp_alex hotmail address in the metadata of a welcome email. But as their burgeoning investigative team followed up on that initial lead, Rabenn and Hemesath periodically asked each other whether they truly had the right guy. Could their too-good-to-be-true tip have been some sort of elaborate misdirection? Could someone have purposefully leaked the address\u2014and even chosen the handle Alpha02\u2014as a way to frame this Cazes, to use him as a patsy? \u201CThe nightmare scenario would be that the source was setting us up,\u201D Rabenn remembers thinking.\nThe only way to know for sure, they would soon find, lay in a different approach\u2014one that only a few years earlier would have seemed impossible. By early 2017, there was a new, growing class of investigators who saw Bitcoin's blockchain as something other than an impenetrable veil. They had come to realize that, far from a mysterious, anonymous currency, Bitcoin was, in fact, an almost entirely traceable financial system. And it was those tracers who would offer the next breakthrough in the race to take down Alpha02.\nCHAPTER 5\nTUNAFISH\nBY LATE 2016, a pair of FBI analysts, both based in Washington, DC, had gained a reputation as perhaps the very best team of cryptocurrency tracers in the US government. (Per their request, they are referred to here by only their first names, Ali and Erin.) The two shared a focus on digital money laundering, a fascination with cryptocurrency, and a yearslong friendship. Despite working for different investigative groups in different offices, they had come to form a two-person team of their own, practically mind-melding into two lobes of a single Bitcoin-obsessed brain. And they operated almost entirely under the radar, only ever producing leads that they quietly handed off to other investigators, clues that appeared in no criminal affidavits or courtroom evidence.\nAs it happened, on a winter morning just weeks after Robert Miller had received his Alpha02 tip\u2014and before almost anyone else in the US government knew about it\u2014Ali had come to Erin with an idea. She'd left the FBI satellite office where she worked, in a grim Beltway office park in Chantilly, Virginia, and driven for half an hour through DC traffic to ambush Erin at her desk at FBI headquarters. Ali, the more ebullient and ambitious of the two, wanted Erin to push aside all their other work so they could try something no one had ever pulled off before: tracking down a dark-web administrator\u2014perhaps even the admin of AlphaBay\u2014through the techniques of blockchain analysis alone.Before Erin had time to protest, Ali squeezed a chair into Erin's tiny cubicle and impatiently grabbed her mouse to start clicking through Bitcoin addresses on her computer screen.\nAli's ambition to expose a dark-web kingpin's finances had come to seem attainable only after years of advances in crypto-tracing techniques\u2014the latest of which had AlphaBay specifically in their crosshairs. Ali and Erin were both fluent users by that point of Reactor, a piece of software made by a New York startup called Chainalysis. Together with a handful of other companies like it, Chainalysis had, since 2014, pioneered and automated a set of powerful new methods for tracing cryptocurrency. Those efforts had quietly flipped the criminal promise of Bitcoin on its head, rendering the blockchain into a branching series of breadcrumb trails that allowed cybercrime investigators to follow the money as never before.\nSome of these techniques were relatively straightforward. For instance, a crypto tracer using Reactor could sometimes follow bitcoins as they moved from address to address until they reached one that could be tied to an account at an exchange, where they were cashed out for traditional currency. Then Chainalysis' customers in law enforcement could simply subpoena the exchange for the account holder's identity, since US law required exchanges to collect this information on American users.\nChainalysis' more powerful contribution to bitcoin tracing had been a collection of \u201Cclustering\u201D methods that allowed it to show when different Bitcoin addresses\u2014dozens to millions of them\u2014belonged to a single person or organization. If Reactor showed that coins from two or more addresses were spent in a single \u201Cmulti-input\u201D transaction, for example, that meant one entity must have control of all those addresses. This trick had made Silk Road users' money relatively easy to track: Just send a few test transactions to any Silk Road account, and the market's wallet system would soon bundle up your coins with others in multi-input transactions, leading to a cluster of other Silk Road addresses\u2014like a briefcase full of bills with a homing device inside, brought back to a criminal's hideout.\nBut Chainalysis had found that the same method didn't work on AlphaBay, which seemed to carefully avoid pooling users' payments, and kept them instead in many small, disconnected addresses. Indeed, by April 2016, AlphaBay had begun advertising to users that it functioned as a bitcoin tumbler: Put money into an AlphaBay account, and it purportedly severed any link that could be used to follow it from where it entered the market to where it left. \u201CNo level of blockchain analysis can prove your coins come from AlphaBay because we use our own obfuscation technology,\u201D read one 2016 post from AlphaBay's staff to users on the site. \u201CYou now have ironclad plausible deniability with your bitcoins.\u201D\nThose claims, Chainalysis found, turned out to be largely true. Because AlphaBay never gathered coins into large, easily identifiable purses, it was nearly impossible to look at any given transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and tell whether it involved a trade on AlphaBay.That layer of obfuscation represented a serious problem for Chainalysis' many customers in law enforcement. And so for much of 2016, mapping all the addresses on the blockchain that were associated with AlphaBay users\u2014the dark market\u2019s \u201Cwallet\u201D\u2014had become the most difficult and pressing challenge Chainalysis had ever taken on. Month after month, Chainalysis' staff performed hundreds of test transactions with AlphaBay\u2014never actually buying anything from the market, only moving money into and out of accounts\u2014and watched the patterns those transactions formed on the blockchain, in hopes of finding clues that they could use to spot patterns elsewhere in the vast expanse of Bitcoin's accounting ledger.\nGradually, the company's researchers found distinct tells in the way AlphaBay moved its users' money. These clues came from the highly specific choices made by Alpha02 and whoever else was writing the code of AlphaBay's wallet. Chainalysis refused to divulge most of them, but cofounder Jonathan Levin offered an example. According to the system of incentives devised by the currency's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, a Bitcoin wallet has to pay a fee for each transaction; the greater the fee, the more likely the thousands of servers known as Bitcoin nodes\u2014the backbone of the Bitcoin network\u2014are to quickly rebroadcast the transaction so that the entire network agrees that the transaction occurred. Most wallets allow users to set their own fees along a sliding scale of speed versus cost. Dark-web markets, however, typically set their own fees. On AlphaBay, Chainalysis discovered, larger transactions required larger fees according to a distinct sliding scale. This represented a small tell\u2014one of many, Levin says\u2014that would allow them to spot transactions likely happening on AlphaBay and so produce a new set of addresses that would then, in turn, lead to others.\nIt was painstaking work. Every time AlphaBay rewrote the software for its wallet, the telltale patterns changed. Yet by the end of 2016, Chainalysis had labeled more than 2.5 million addresses as part of AlphaBay's wallet.\nFor Chainalysis' law enforcement customers, however, that breakthrough was just a starting point. The task that still lay ahead would be to follow the money from somewhere in that vast pile of numbers out to the bank account of a real human being. And from a cubicle in Washington, DC, that's exactly what Ali and Erin set out to do.\nON THAT WINTER day in 2016 when Ali decided to conscript Erin into her unprecedented scheme, she hurriedly explained to Erin a realization she'd had. Dark-web markets, everyone knew by then, were notoriously vulnerable to \u201Cexit scams\u201D: schemes in which an administrator suddenly shuts down a market and then absconds with all its users' money. Every time this happened, dark-web forums were flooded with laments and reminders that no one should store any more cryptocurrency on a market than they planned to spend immediately.\nBut there was one person, Ali figured, who would never have to worry about an exit scam when considering where to keep their crypto savings: the dark-web site's administrator himself. \u201CWho would have the most faith to leave their money on the market?\u201D Ali asked Erin. \u201COf course it would be the guy in charge.\u201DSo what if they simply searched for the black market addresses that had held the largest sums of bitcoins for the longest time? The biggest, most stationary piles of money might just belong to the bosses.\nErin admitted it was a good idea. But after identifying a few addresses to look at, she shooed Ali out of her office to get on with her other work. After all, no one had asked them to track down Alpha02; they had intelligence reports to write and more realistic targets to hunt.\nThe next day, however, Ali began calling Erin every few minutes with breathless updates. She had started with the address of the biggest sum of bitcoins that had sat unmoved for the longest time among all the wallet addresses tied to the AlphaBay cluster. And, spotting the point where that money had finally changed addresses, she'd been able to track its movements from one hop to another, following its path in Reactor through the branching tendrils forking off from the market.\n\u201CIt's still going!\u201D she'd tell Erin excitedly on the phone as she followed it from one address to the next.\nSoon Erin, infected by Ali's enthusiasm, was digging through other unmoved piles of bitcoins that she now suspected might be an administrator's commissions. Talking constantly on the phone across the DC\u2013Virginia border, they began to devote hours to their Alpha02 hunt, scanning through hundreds of AlphaBay addresses in Reactor.\nWhoever owned these piles of presumably criminal money had, at least in some cases, taken pains to hide their footprints on the blockchain. The funds would sometimes flow into clusters of addresses created by services known as mixers, advertised on dark-web sites with names like Helix and Bitcoin Fog. These bitcoin-laundering services offered to take in coins, pool them with other users' funds, and then return all the coins in the pool to their senders at new addresses. In theory this would cut the forensic link for any tracer, like a bank robber who slips into a movie theater, takes off his ski mask, and walks out with the crowd, evading the police on his tail.\nAli and Erin did sometimes hit dead ends in their work to trace Alpha02's profits. But in other cases, they were able to defeat his efforts at obfuscation. Neither of the two FBI analysts would reveal how they overcame Alpha02's use of mixers, but crypto tracers like those at Chainalysis offered hints.\nA mixer, Jonathan Levin explained, is only as good as its \u201Canonymity set\u201D\u2014the crowd of users mixing their coins to render them untraceable. Despite whatever claims mixers made to their customers, examining their work on the blockchain revealed that many didn't actually offer an anonymity set large enough to truly flummox an investigator. The more money someone tried to launder, the harder it became to avoid those coins remaining recognizable when they reappeared on the mixer's other end.\nAny decent mixer splits large sums of coins into smaller, less conspicuous payments when returning the money to its owner. But with transaction fees for every payment, there's a limit to how much big sums of money will be broken up, Levin says.In truth, Chainalysis didn't need to offer its users proof of the path that money took on the blockchain, so much as probability. Grant Rabenn candidly explained that the bar for sending a subpoena to a cryptocurrency exchange for a user's identifying information was low enough that they could simply try multiple educated guesses.\nAll of this meant that, in spite of a criminal's best efforts, investigators were often left with suspicious outputs from mixers, ones that they could follow with enough likelihood\u2014if not certainty\u2014of staying on their target's trail. Even the crowded-movie-theater trick, it turns out, breaks down when the robber is carrying a large enough sack of loot and the cops are watching every exit.\nAS ALI AND Erin followed what they increasingly believed to be Alpha02's personal transactions, they gave nicknames to the most significant Bitcoin addresses they were scrutinizing, turning the strings of meaningless characters into pronounceable words. An address that started 1Lcyn4t would become, in their private language, \u201CLye sin fort.\u201D One that began with the characters 3MboAt would be pronounced \u201CEm boat.\u201D The two analysts spent so much time examining and discussing these names that the addresses began to take on \u201Cpersonalities\u201D in their minds. (\u201CIt\u2019s not exactly healthy,\u201D Erin said.)\nOf all of their named addresses, one loomed largest in the two analysts' conversations. They refused to reveal even its nickname for fear that someone might reverse engineer the actual address and learn their tricks. For the purposes of this story, let's call it \u201CTunafish.\u201D\nTunafish lay at the end of a long string of hops Ali and Erin had followed out from one of the initial addresses that they'd hypothesized might be Alpha02's. It held special significance, however: It connected directly to an exchange. For the first time, they realized with excitement, they had managed to trace what they suspected might be a collection of the AlphaBay admin's bitcoins all the way to a transaction in which Alpha02 had traded them for traditional currency. They knew it was at those cash-out points\u2014the blockchain's connections to the brick-and-mortar world of finance\u2014that they might be able to match the transactions to a real person.\nJust as they were on the verge of ferreting out a name behind all of Alpha02's transactions, Ali got wind of some news quietly floating among law enforcement agents across the country. As a longtime dark-web analyst, she'd kept in close contact for years with the Sacramento FBI agent who had first opened a file on AlphaBay. So when the Sacramento office joined forces with Grant Rabenn's Fresno team, Ali was among the first people the agent called. He told her that they had finally matched a real person to Alpha02's online persona. He gave her the name of a certain French-Canadian living in Bangkok.\nInvestigators started to recognize Cazes' identifying tells. In some cases, his attempts to obscure his ownership of bitcoins became, themselves, a kind of fingerprint.\nThe Sacramento agent knew Ali was already busy tracing AlphaBay's blockchain tentacles. He asked her to join their growing investigative team. Ali returned to Erin's office at FBI headquarters, cornered her in the hallway, and insisted she join the team, too. \u201CThis is going to be a massive case,\u201D Ali told her. \u201CWe need to do this together.\u201D Erin said yes.\nNow they were hunting Alpha02 no longer as an obsessive hobby, but as part of an official investigation. Ali and Erin explained their Tunafish discovery to an assistant US attorney based in DC who had also joined the team, a seasoned cybercrime prosecutor named Louisa Marion. She, Rabenn, and Hemesath immediately filed a subpoena for the identifying records on the exchange where the Tunafish address had been cashed out.That legal request took weeks to bear fruit. Finally, one evening in the early weeks of January 2017, Ali was in the middle of a law school night class when she got a call from the Sacramento-based FBI agent with the news: The subpoena results had come back.\nThe agent told her the name on the exchange account tied to the Tunafish address. It was Alexandre Cazes.\nOVER THE NEXT months, Ali and Erin continued to trace more high-value addresses out of the AlphaBay cluster into one cryptocurrency exchange after another. They came to recognize what seemed to be Cazes' identifying tells, even in his bitcoin-laundering habits; in some cases, his attempts to obscure his ownership of the bitcoins became, themselves, a kind of fingerprint.\nIn total, the two analysts traced Cazes' commissions to a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges. The prosecutors then subpoenaed these one by one, finding accounts registered in both Cazes' and his wife's names. And as those results came in, a yearslong pattern emerged: Cazes would open an account with an exchange and attempt to use it to cash out a chunk of AlphaBay's profits. At some point\u2014often within months of his cash-out transactions\u2014the exchange would grow suspicious about the origin of these massive cryptocurrency trades and ask for more know-your-customer information from him.\nCazes would send a note explaining that he was merely an early investor in Bitcoin. In some cases the AlphaBay founder claimed to have bought thousands of coins from the defunct exchange Mt. Gox in 2011 or 2012\u2014knowing it would be difficult to check the records, given that Mt. Gox had declared bankruptcy in 2014. In others, Cazes claimed to have bought them from a private seller at the exchange rate of a dollar each. \u201CSince then, I\u2019ve been pretty much juggling the coins like stocks, buying and selling, but never cashing out,\u201D he wrote in one emailed explanation to an exchange.\nBy 2017, however, legitimate Bitcoin businesses had learned to be wary of these unverifiable stories. In most cases they closed or froze Cazes' account, forcing him to move onto another exchange. Ali and Erin, meanwhile, could see the true source of Cazes' wealth traced out in strand after strand of the blockchain's connections.\nFor years to come, the investigators involved in the AlphaBay case would debate whether their cryptocurrency tracing alone would have cracked the case even if they had never gotten the Pimp_alex_91 tip. Would the appearance of Cazes' name on those exchange accounts have been enough to put them onto his trail, or would they have treated it as just another vague lead that they were too busy to chase down?\nComing as it did, however, in the immediate wake of the tip sent to Miller about Alpha02, the two FBI analysts' blockchain work nailed to the wall a theory that would have otherwise hung by only a few threads. Every exchange subpoena and its results drew another line between Cazes and AlphaBay's fortune.\n\u201CWhen we saw millions of dollars in crypto flowing to him from what appeared to be AlphaBay-associated wallets, I was fairly confident that we had the right person,\u201D Rabenn says. \u201CWhen you hit that point, you start gearing up to indict.\u201D\nContinued in part 3: When investigators find Cazes\u2019 online alter ego on a pickup artist forum, they also discover a new challenge to catching him red-handed\u2014and hatch a plan for the most ambitious sting in dark-web history.\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday. \nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

A slight, 46-year-old agent of the Royal Thai Police with a short, boyish haircut, she wore a white polo shirt and black pants rather than her usual military-style uniform. Both she and the female officer beside her in the passenger seat were working undercover.\nThis story is excerpted from the forthcoming book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nCOURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE\nNueng's heart pounded. For more than two years, law enforcement agents from around the world had been hunting the dark-web mastermind known as Alpha02, a shadowy figure who oversaw millions of dollars a day in narcotics sales and had built the largest digital drug and crime bazaar in history, known as AlphaBay. Now, a coordinated takedown and sting involving no fewer than six countries' agencies had tracked Alpha02 to Thailand. The operation had finally led to this quiet block in Bangkok, to the home of a 26-year-old Canadian named Alexandre Cazes. Nueng knew that the success of the plot to arrest Cazes and knock out this linchpin of the global underworld economy hinged on what she did in the next few moments.\nTrying to give the impression of an inexperienced driver, Nueng slowly rolled the car toward a model home and real estate office at the end of the cul-de-sac. She signaled to a security guard outside the house that she had taken a wrong turn and needed to pull a 180. She heard him shout at her to back directly out instead, that the street was too narrow for a three-point turn.\nNueng quickly muttered a nearly silent prayer\u2014an adapted, high-speed plea to the holy trinity of the Buddha, his teachings, and all the monks and nuns in his service. \u201CDear Buddha, please bless me with success,\u201D she whispered in Thai. \u201CDear Dhamma, please bless me with success. Dear Sangha, please bless me with success.\u201D\nThen she put the car in reverse, turned the wheel to the left, and ever so gently\u2014almost in slow motion\u2014slammed the Toyota's fender into Alexandre Cazes' front gate.\nCHAPTER 1\nALPHA02\nAROUND 18 MONTHS earlier, Robert Miller sat in the US Drug Enforcement Administration's wiretap room in Fresno, California, spending another painfully boring day listening in on the life of one of the DEA's endless supply of narcotics targets in California's Central Valley.\nAll Miller ever wanted was to be on a SWAT team. At the academy, instructors had praised him for his instinctive judgment and thoroughness\u2014how, in training raids on the academy's mock-ups of drug dens, he always meticulously cleared his corners and covered his blind spots. And when the young DEA agent was assigned to the agency's field office in Fresno right after graduation, he had high hopes it would put him where he wanted to be: making arrests, carrying out search warrants, \u201Chitting doors,\u201D as he put it. (Miller's name and some personal details have been changed, per his request.)The sunbaked agricultural city in the middle of California had long served as a corridor for cocaine, heroin, weed, and methamphetamine smugglers, as traffickers from the southern border made their way to buyers in the Northwest and on the East Coast. Agents spent their days carrying out undercover buy-and-busts, following trucks packed with dope along Highway 99 and tracking, raiding, and arresting cartel operators.\nBut not long after he moved to Fresno, Miller injured his foot and his shoulder while rock climbing. Both injuries required surgery. There would be no SWAT team, no \u201Chitting doors\u201D\u2014not, at least, for the two years it would take to recover.\nSo Miller was assigned to surveillance. He'd stake out targets from his car or sit in the office's wiretap room, listening to suspects' phone calls and reading their texts for weeks or sometimes months on end. The work was often mind-numbingly mundane. \u201CNinety-nine percent boredom and 1 percent excitement,\u201D as he remembers it.\nAt one point in 2013, Miller's partner on a surveillance assignment suggested they try to work on a new sort of case. She had heard about a booming drug market on the dark web called Silk Road\u2014a site where anyone could connect through the anonymity software Tor and spend bitcoins to buy any drug imaginable\u2014and its pseudonymous creator, the Dread Pirate Roberts. But when Miller asked his superiors about the site, he was told that teams in New York and Baltimore were already on it. Not long after, while Miller was on a surveillance stakeout in his car in a mall parking lot, his phone buzzed with an alert that the notorious market had been busted. The Dread Pirate Roberts turned out to be a 29-year-old Texan with no criminal record named Ross Ulbricht. He had been arrested in the science fiction section of San Francisco's Glen Park Public Library with his laptop open and logged in to Silk Road.\nTwo long years later, in early 2016, Miller's boss came into the wiretap room and asked whether Miller wanted to join a different team. Someone in the office had remembered Miller's inquiry into Silk Road. A local assistant US attorney had assembled a group to focus on dark-web crime, and he was looking for volunteers from all the federal agencies clustered around Courthouse Park in Fresno's downtown square: the Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The assignment, Miller knew, was pretty much the opposite of the SWAT team. But at least it would be something new. \u201COK,\u201D he said. \u201CI'll do it.\u201D\nGRANT RABENN, THE young prosecutor at the helm of Fresno's dark-web strike force, laid out a set of modest initial goals for the group: They would be going after individual money launderers and drug dealers, not kingpins and masterminds. \u201CWe are not the Southern District of New York. We are in a dusty town in the Central Valley of California,\u201D as Rabenn put it. \u201CLet's hit singles before we try to go for a home run.\u201DThat humble starting point was fine with Miller, who had little idea of how the dark-web drug trade even worked. When Rabenn asked Miller to start making undercover heroin buys, he couldn't figure out how to buy bitcoins, let alone the drugs themselves. He drove two and a half hours to San Jose to find a physical bitcoin ATM rather than simply use an online exchange. Even then, he discovered that after transaction fees he could purchase only half a gram of heroin instead of the 2 grams he'd planned on.\nBut slowly, as Miller poked around the dark web and perused the various markets, he got a feel for the post-Silk Road online drug economy. He soon came to see that it was dominated by a single entity: AlphaBay.\nSign Up Today\nGet exclusive commentary and behind-the-scenes notes from writer Andy Greenberg. Sign up for The Rise and Fall of AlphaBay companion newsletter. \nAlphaBay had first appeared in late 2014, just one in the broad scrum of markets vying for a share of the growing dark-web criminal trade. But the site's pseudonymous administrator, Alpha02, seemed cannier than those behind many of the competing markets. Alpha02 was a well known if not exceptionally talented \u201Ccarder,\u201D a cybercriminal hacker focused on credit card theft and fraud. He'd become a significant player on Tor Carding Forum, a dark-web site where hackers traded in stolen data. He'd even sold his own 16-page \u201CUniversity of Carding Guide,\u201D designed to teach beginners the tricks of the trade, like how to \u201Csocial-engineer\u201D customer service representatives at banks, calling from spoofed telephone numbers to deceive them into approving fraudulent transactions.\nIn its first months online, AlphaBay seemed destined to serve much the same hacker clientele. It was devoted almost exclusively to cybercriminal wares, such as stolen account logins and credit card data. But as Alpha02 bootstrapped the site from its carder origins, its portfolio of vendors quickly expanded to offer the dark web's more lucrative contraband: ecstasy, marijuana, meth, cocaine, and heroin, all shipped through the mail. Soon it became clear that Alpha02's grand vision was to unite two spheres of the dark web that had, until then, been somewhat distinct\u2014one devoted to cybercrime and the other to drugs\u2014to create a single mega-market. AlphaBay's goal, he declared, was \u201Cto become the largest eBay-style underworld marketplace.\u201D\nSilk Road's Dread Pirate Roberts had espoused a kind of anarcho-capitalist ideal, describing his site as a \u201Cmovement\u201D or a \u201Crevolution\u201D bent on liberating mankind from oppressive government control of commerce and limiting sellers, at least in theory, to offering only \u201Cvictimless\u201D products. Alpha02, by contrast, seemed to adopt a much less high-minded focus on the bottom line. Aside from a ban on child abuse materials and murder for hire, the only rule Alpha02 imposed on AlphaBay's vendors was that they not sell data or accounts stolen from Russia or other former Soviet states, or infect those countries' computers with malware. This prohibition, common among cybercriminals from that part of the world, was typically designed to avoid trouble from Russian law enforcement\u2014a kind of \u201Cdon't shit where you sleep\u201D principle. For Miller and other federal agents and prosecutors sniffing around the site, it also suggested that AlphaBay and its mysterious founder were likely based in Russia\u2014an impression cemented by Alpha02's signature in messages on the site's forums: \u201CБудьте в безопасности, братья,\u201D Russian for \u201CBe safe, brothers.\u201D\nIn an interview in April 2015 with the news site and dark-web directory DeepDotWeb, Alpha02 reassured his users that he and his site were beyond the reach of any Silk Road-style seizure. \u201CI am absolutely certain my opsec is secure,\u201D he wrote, using the shorthand for \u201Coperational security,\u201D and added, \u201CI live in an offshore country where I am safe.\u201DThroughout that interview, Alpha02 wrote in the style of a corporate press release: \u201CWe have made sure to have created a stable & fast marketplace web application which has been built with security in mind right from the start,\u201D he wrote, adding, \u201CWe would like to assure all of our users (both vendors & buyers) that their security, privacy and anonymity rank first place in our priorities list.\u201D\nWhat Alpha02 lacked in political inspiration he seemed to make up for in technological aspiration and coding competency. He boasted about features that included auction-style bidding, search tools that helped fraudsters comb through stolen data to carefully choose their victims, and a multi-signature transaction scheme designed to reassure users that it would be far harder for law enforcement or rogue staff to steal funds held in escrow.\nAmong digital crime investigators, Alpha02's notoriety was like that of Osama bin Laden. He and AlphaBay were invoked at every law enforcement conference on cybercrime, every interagency meeting, every training event.\n\u201CWe want to have every imaginable possible feature to be the #1 market,\u201D he wrote to DeepDotWeb. On each page of AlphaBay, he'd signed his work: \u201Cproudly designed by Alpha02.\u201D\nWhen a judge imposed a double life sentence on the Silk Road's Ross Ulbricht in May 2015, she told the court that the draconian sentence was partly meant to scare off future dark-web drug buyers, dealers, and administrators. By the time of AlphaBay's rise, that unprecedented punishment seemed to have had the opposite effect. A study in The British Journal of Criminology found that sales on what was then the top dark-web site, Agora, more than doubled in the days following the news of Ulbricht's sentencing, to more than $350,000 a day. The study's author, trying to interpret that unexpected increase, reasoned that by imposing such a shocking prison term, the judge had only generated new awareness of the dark-web drug trade. Rather than deterring users, the judge seemed to have created a massive advertisement for the world's burgeoning cryptocurrency black markets.\nAlpha02 was hardly fazed by the news. Following Ulbricht's sentencing, in an interview with Vice's tech news site, Motherboard, he momentarily affected a revolutionary posture, picking up the Dread Pirate Roberts' torch. \u201CCourts can stop a man, but they can't stop an ideology,\u201D he wrote. \u201CDarknet markets will always be around, until the war on drugs stops.\u201D\nBut in response to other questions, AlphaBay's boss seemed to ditch the torch and speak more plainly. \u201CWe have to carry on with business,\u201D he wrote. \u201CWe all need money to eat.\u201D\nBY THE FALL of 2015, AlphaBay was the biggest market on the dark web. Agora's administrators had taken their site offline that August, citing concerns that a vulnerability in Tor, the online anonymity system that powered the dark web, might be used to locate Agora's servers. AlphaBay appeared to have no such security flaw. As it absorbed Agora's tens of thousands of buyers and vendors, the growing crowd of law enforcement agents around the world surveilling the site could find no coding or opsec slipups to give them the slightest clue as to where they might find its servers, not to mention its founder.\nShortly before AlphaBay took over the dark web's top spot, Alpha02 had changed his username on the site to merely \u201Cadmin\u201D and announced that he would no longer accept any private messages sent to him by anyone other than AlphaBay's staff. Instead, he left much of the site's communications work to his second-in-command and head of security, a figure who went by the pseudonym DeSnake.The Alpha02 moniker had served its purpose, lending the site its initial credibility. Now the person behind it intended, like discreet criminal bosses the world over, to slip into the shadows, raking in his fortune as quietly and anonymously as possible.\nThat fortune was, by the time of Alpha02's name change, growing at an unprecedented rate: By October 2015, AlphaBay had more than 200,000 users and more than 21,000 product listings for drugs, compared to just 12,000 listings on Silk Road at its peak. Sometime around the middle of 2016, AlphaBay surpassed Agora's peak sales rate of $350,000 a day, according to researchers at Carnegie Mellon. It had become not only the biggest black market on the dark web, but the biggest cryptocurrency black market of all time. And it was still growing wildly.\nFor Grant Rabenn, the Fresno-based prosecutor, it was clear that Alpha02 was now the most wanted man on the dark web; Rabenn compared his notoriety among digital crime investigators to that of Osama bin Laden. AlphaBay and Alpha02 were invoked at every law enforcement conference on cybercrime, every interagency meeting, every training event, Rabenn says. And as the target on Alpha02's back loomed larger, so too did the unspoken fear that this mastermind might stay a step ahead of them indefinitely.\n\u201CIs this person just a pure genius who's figured out all of the possible mistakes?\u201D Rabenn remembers asking himself. \u201CHas this individual found the perfect country with the right IT infrastructure to run a marketplace, and he's able to bribe the officials there so we'll never touch him?\n\u201CAs every day passed there was, more and more, a sense that this might be the special one,\u201D Rabenn says. \u201CYou begin to wonder: Is this the Michael Jordan of the dark web?\u201D\nBut Rabenn followed these discussions of Alpha02 from a distance. The idea that his Fresno team might actually take on the Michael Jordan of the dark web had never occurred to him. \u201CIt's not expected for people like us,\u201D he says simply, \u201Cto go after a site like that.\u201D\nCHAPTER 2\nTHE TIP\nBEFORE GRANT RABENN became a federal prosecutor, his second job out of law school was at a boutique firm in Washington, DC, devoted to defending white-collar criminals. The young, olive-skinned lawyer with dark hair and a Hollywood smile ended up representing Russian oligarchs and corporate executives accused of bribing foreign governments. \u201CVery interesting, wealthy people trying to hide their assets and avoid scrutiny,\u201D as he described them, or alternatively, \u201CJames Bond characters who are jet-setting around the world with suitcases full of cash.\u201D\nRabenn was captivated by these glimpses into a world of billions of dollars moving in invisible transactions. But he also found that he admired and envied the prosecutors on the other side of the table\u2014the way they worked in the public interest and possessed a certain autonomy, choosing which cases they would pursue. So he began applying for Justice Department jobs, finally finding one in Fresno.Despite having grown up in Southern California, Rabenn couldn't place Fresno on a map. But when he arrived at its DOJ office in 2011, he found what he'd always wanted: a place with almost no hierarchy or bureaucracy, where he was simply told to focus on money laundering and was otherwise given free rein. For the next few years, he and the local agents tackled fraud and extortion, child exploitation, corrupt cops, and, of course, drug trafficking\u2014following illicit trails of money wherever they led. \u201CWe were just running and gunning,\u201D Rabenn says of those prolific years with a boyish enthusiasm.\nRabenn's money-laundering cases often began with the stream of suspicious activity reports that banks were required to file under the Bank Secrecy Act. By mid-2013, Rabenn found that more and more of those reports were being triggered by financial transfers out of crypto exchanges, platforms where users could trade digital currency for traditional money like dollars, euros, or yen. The banks often suspected that these currency swaps were cash-outs of dirty digital profits. So Rabenn immersed himself in dozens of hours of YouTube videos to understand this still new currency called Bitcoin, its mechanics, and how it seemed to be powering an anonymous underworld of online commerce.\nCriminals flocked to these dark markets because the cryptocurrency was widely believed to be anonymous and untraceable. Sure, every transaction was immortalized on Bitcoin's blockchain, an unforgeable, unchangeable, and altogether public ledger. But that ledger recorded only which bitcoins resided at which Bitcoin addresses\u2014long, unique strings of letters and numbers\u2014at any given moment. In theory, at least, that meant buyers and sellers of illicit goods on opposite sides of the globe could send one another cash payments from behind the mask of those cryptic addresses without revealing any hint of their real-world identities.\nBut just as cryptocurrency-based platforms like AlphaBay opened up vast new global markets to criminals, they also opened up huge new opportunities for law enforcement, as Rabenn quickly realized. The dark web presented him with the chance to work cases on a scale that would otherwise be impossible in Fresno: As long as a dark-web drug dealer could be coaxed into sending a package to the Eastern District of California, the crime officially occurred in his jurisdiction.\nRabenn had no real idea how to pierce the veil of the blockchain's anonymity. But he figured that even dark-web dealers must sometimes make mistakes that could be caught through traditional buy-and-bust police work. For an ambitious young prosecutor, the possibility was thrilling. \u201CI wasn't necessarily happy with just prosecuting drug mules driving meth up the 99 freeway,\u201D he says. If he could arrange an undercover buy online and somehow identify the seller, he could arrest dealers all over the country. \u201CAll I have to do is order dope from them, and then we can go get them. And that's what we did.\u201D\nIN 2014, RABENN began forming his dark-web strike force, inviting local investigators from Fresno's Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigations offices to join. It was a small team of \u201Codd ducks,\u201D as he describes them\u2014agents on the more cerebral side, content to work cases largely on a computer screen instead of kicking down doors like their Central Valley colleagues.By the time he recruited Robert Miller out of the DEA's wiretap room, Rabenn's team had already achieved some success with their undercover approach. They'd started by cracking down on a few so-called peer-to-peer exchangers\u2014individuals who bought and sold bitcoins in the real world and were often used by dark-web dealers to cash out their dirty cryptocurrency. In several cases, they'd mined those exchangers' Rolodexes for leads on the legal names of dealers who'd done business with them, tracked them down, and arrested them.\nBut Rabenn had also begun to suspect that his original hunch was correct: Many of the dealers they targeted were indeed sloppy enough that agents could simply purchase drugs and look for clues either in their packaging or the vendors' online profiles.\nMiller, starting his new assignment, assembled the usernames of AlphaBay's top dealers of heroin and the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, and he began to buy from them one by one. As the packages arrived, triple-sealed in silver Mylar and plastic, Miller and the team scrutinized both the shipments and their sellers' online presence. They found that one vendor had made an elementary mistake: He'd linked his PGP key\u2014the unique file that allowed him to exchange encrypted messages with customers\u2014with his email address on the PGP key server that stores a catalog of users' identities.\nMiller and Rabenn quickly tied that email to the dealer's social media accounts and real name. They learned that he was based in New York. Miller then found fingerprints on a package of heroin sent from one of his accounts, which matched those of another New York man. Finally, Miller worked with postal inspectors to get photos taken by a post office self-service kiosk. The photos showed the second New Yorker putting a dope shipment in the mail. Miller and a team of agents flew across the country, searched the two men's homes, and arrested them both.\nThe same simple PGP trick allowed Miller to find the real name of another dark-web opiates dealer\u2014which turned out to be part of his dark-web handle, written backward\u2014and caught him shipping dope, again using evidence from a post office kiosk camera. When agents raided the man's home in San Francisco, Miller says, they found piles of fentanyl and heroin powder sitting on tables and in open plastic containers.\nRabenn's team was now on a roll, building significant cases\u2014and even a reputation. When Miller ordered a package of opiates addressed to Fresno, he was amused when his San Francisco suspect warned him that a particularly aggressive group of feds operating out of the Central Valley seemed to be targeting players on the dark web and that he'd better watch his back.\nBut Miller and Rabenn didn't kid themselves: Busting a few of AlphaBay's sloppier dealers wasn't any more likely to topple that black market than the DEA was to defeat Mexican cartels by chasing yet another meth mule up Highway 99.\nBY NOVEMBER 2016, Miller was ready to try something new again. He'd achieved a couple of decent dark-web busts, but he didn't love the paperwork or the weeks spent in front of a screen. His shoulder and foot had finally recovered. Perhaps it wasn't too late to get onto the SWAT team after all.Then, one afternoon, Miller returned to the office after picking up lunch, his In-N-Out Burger bag still in hand, to find an email from an intriguing stranger.\nThe email explained that the sender had been googling dark-web arrests, looking for a law enforcement contact. They'd tried the FBI tip line, but no one had responded. They'd tried Homeland Security\u2014no luck there either. Finally, they'd found Miller's contact information in one of the Fresno team's criminal indictments of an AlphaBay drug dealer.\nSo the stranger had decided to try getting in touch with Miller. And now they were ready to share a tip about who Alpha02 might really be.\nContinued in part 2: On the trail of a mastermind, a tip leads detectives to a suspect in Bangkok\u2014and to the daunting task of tracing his millions in cryptocurrency.\nThis story is excerpted from the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, available November 15, 2022, from Doubleday.\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Last year, investors pumped $23.7bn into startups associated with the idea, while Google search traffic for the term jumped by almost 10,000 percent. To some, this supposed \u2018next version of the web\u2019 promises not only a new era of online life, but nothing less than a new stage in the evolution of capitalism. \u201CWe're witnessing the birth of a new economic system,\u201D wrote Artfunder founder Salvatore Delle Palme in his December blog post \u2018On The Promise Of Web3\u2019. \u201CIts features and tenets are just now being devised and refined in transparent ways by millions of people around the world. Everyone is welcome to participate.\u201D\nWIRED Consulting brings WIRED's network and knowledge to businesses and thought leaders. It is an independent entity separate from WIRED's newsroom. For more information visit consulting.wired.co.uk\nNot everyone has accepted the invitation. Some of the biggest names in technology have publicly poured scorn on Web3. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey dismissed it as a venture capitalist ploy. Elon Musk said it was just a marketing buzzword. Computer scientists and software developers have written eviscerating, widely shared essays with titles like \u2018The Web3 Fraud\u2019, \u2018Web3 Is Bullshit\u2019 and \u2018Web3 Is A Stupid Idea\u2019.\nSo what exactly is Web3, and is it the future? A January survey of 1,500 US consumers found that 54 percent had never even heard of it.\nWell, here\u2019s the pitch. Web 1.0 was the first phase of the World Wide Web. This was the age of GeoCities, Netscape and bright blue hyperlinks. Webpages were static, interaction was minimal, and the online world was effectively a giant digital library \u2013 with added GIFs. This lasted until the mid-2000s when Web 2.0 came along. Suddenly, to publish something on the internet, you no longer needed to make a website and find someone to host it \u2013 and thus the web\u2019s content consumers were now also its content creators. Blogs, comments, updates, posts, tweets and likes were everywhere. Where once you might have looked at Encarta online, you now searched Wikipedia \u2013 and perhaps also contributed to an entry. To quote Tim O\u2019Reilly, the influential technologist who popularised the term Web 2.0 in 2004, this was \u201Cthe web as platform\u201D.\nHowever, some spied a problem. While Web 1.0 felt open and community-driven, Web 2.0 \u2013 which remains the web we have today \u2013 is dominated by a small number of companies. To critics, these tech giants account for a troubling share of internet use and global computing that focusses undue power in their hands. What they see as an unsettling business model also prevails: a devil\u2019s bargain whereby users give up their data in exchange for free access to online services. Since the platforms control that data, you can\u2019t easily take it with you if you wish to use a competitor. Oh, and all the clever things you post on social media? They don\u2019t necessarily make a penny for you \u2013 but they make the platforms rich. In Web 2.0, we are the product.\nBut fear not, say the acolytes of Web3 (as they like to style it). In the next era we are going to fix all that. How? As if you needed to ask: blockchain.\nA QUICK OVERVIEW. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Simply put, it is an exhaustive record of all the transactions that happen within a network but it isn\u2019t held on one central computer. Instead, all of the computers in that network have a complete copy of the record. New transactions are only added to the blockchain when a set threshold of computers agree they\u2019re valid. That makes it theoretically tamper-proof and, if a government or hacker shuts down one computer, no bother: there are copies on countless other machines. A consequence of this model is that you don\u2019t need a trusted third party to facilitate an interaction or grant permission for it to occur. Contrast that to paying a bill from your regular current account \u2013 the banks, and the regulators that govern them, mediate the whole process. With blockchain, power is decentralised, spread among the users of the network.\nTo those who believe that tech is too centralised, blockchains seem ideally suited to remake it. This is because they aren\u2019t just about peer-to-peer currency. They can also run code. A blockchain like Ethereum, for instance, not only sustains the Ether cryptocurrency but also provides the means to run decentralised applications (known as dApps) or create decentralised business structures (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations, or DAOs). Unlike a regular app, a dApp doesn't require a central entity facilitating interactions (and typically taking a slice of the pie in return). Instead, users are connected directly with one another over a blockchain. Activities are automated by \u201Csmart contracts\u201D: decentralised computer programs that also run on the blockchain. Ideally, the whole thing would be open-source, although in practice many dApps don't yet meet this criterion. But anything from a game to a social network could theoretically be a dApp. \nAn array of dApps already exist. LooksRare, for example, is a marketplace for buying NFTs that was built on the Ethereum blockchain. Right now, however, most are financial applications such as currency exchanges or lending platforms. That\u2019s because \u201Cfinance is just the area where centralised technology sucks the most\u201D, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin told the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris last year. \u201CI can send you a centralised email, and you will get it within one second. And sure, maybe various intelligence agencies will read it, but\u2026 at least you can read it one second from now. International bank wires do not work that way.\u201D\nThe business models for dApps aren\u2019t about gathering and selling data. Instead, they are typically predicated on \u201Ccrypto tokens\u201D (effectively a form of cryptocurrency). People who contribute to the dApp \u2013 perhaps by creating popular content or adding to its code \u2013 could be rewarded in these tokens. Users might also be able to acquire tokens either through buying them or via \u201Cstaking\u201D or \u201Cyield farming\u201D \u2013 essentially, parking their tokens on the platform and earning interest on them. Ideally, these tokens would play into a governance model that furnishes holders with voting rights over the direction of the project. \nOf course, there has to be some other reason to consider these tokens valuable, so the dApp will come up with a way to create demand for them. If the dApp is a game, perhaps the tokens can buy you new weapons for your character, or if it\u2019s a social network maybe the tokens can be exchanged for advertising space. The dApp\u2019s value is thus distributed among its users rather than channelled towards a CEO. Theory goes, the desire to accumulate tokens and see them improve in value means that everyone is working in each others\u2019 best interests.\nCrucially, because all user data sits on a blockchain \u2013 and individual users own and control their own data \u2013 they can take it with them if they wish to migrate from one dApp to another. In Web3, say proponents, we are no longer exploited.\nIn the case of a DAO, the business takes the form of a cooperative, owned by its members. There is no executive board wielding power, as all of the entity\u2019s operations and transactions are managed by software: everything happens automatically according to predefined rules. dApps that aim to be truly decentralised are therefore usually managed by DAOs.\nThe DAO's software yet again takes the form of smart contracts. The only way their rules can be changed is by a vote \u2013 voting being the mechanism through which all human decision-making takes place. Again, crypto tokens are key. Typically, those who invest in the DAO receive tokens specific to the project, and those who carry out work for the DAO are also rewarded in these tokens. Those with more tokens have greater voting power. \u201CA DAO is a group of people that come together around a shared community and a shared resource,\u201D is how the software engineer Jonah Erlich explained it to The Verge in December. \u201CThe most fun description I\u2019ve heard is that a DAO is a group chat with a bank account.\u201D In November 2021, a DAO called ConstitutionDAO \u2013 in which Erlich had a key role \u2013 raised $47m to buy an original copy of the US Constitution at Sotheby\u2019s. It failed, but only because it was outbid. \n\u201CI think this is as big as it gets,\u201D Nitin Sharma, general partner and global Web3 lead at the venture capital firm Antler, tells WIRED Consulting. \u201CWe're talking about essentially a completely new internet. It's not a sector. It's not a segment. It's really a layer. So it's essentially talking about how in five, 10, 20 years, everything we know about the internet could be different.\u201D\nTHE IDEA OF WEB3 ISN'T NEW. The first person to use the term in the current sense was Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood back in 2014. Writing on his blog, Wood argued the Edward Snowden leaks made clear that \u201Centrusting our information to organisations in general is a fundamentally broken model\u201D. He came up with the notion of Web3 as a possible solution, although \u2013 in light of Snowden \u2013 his vision for it also put an anonymous messaging system front and centre.\nIn late 2021 the term was rediscovered by Silicon Valley and became its buzzword of the moment, thanks in large part to the influential venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. In October 2021, Chris Dixon, who runs its crypto investments, wrote a Twitter thread that went viral. \u201CWeb 3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens,\u201D he tweeted. \u201CBefore Web 3, users and builders had to choose between the limited functionality of Web 1 or the corporate, centralized model of Web 2. Web 3 offers a new way that combines the best aspects of the previous eras. It\u2019s very early in this movement and a great time to get involved.\u201D And get involved they did. Now you can\u2019t move for \u201CWeb3 startups\u201D \u2013 and seemingly any crypto-oriented idea or any new vision of how we\u2019ll use the internet of tomorrow gets labelled \u201CWeb3\u201D. Case in point: the so-called metaverse. \u201CThe metaverse\u201D typically refers to a hypothetical network of virtual worlds \u2013 these don\u2019t necessarily have to be built on a blockchain. But in some quarters the word \u201Cmetaverse\u201D has become almost interchangeable with \u201CWeb3\u201D.\nCan you say bubble? Many have. More cynical commentators see the whole thing as a ruse to create demand for cryptocurrency \u2013 a way of bringing more people into the great crypto Ponzi scheme. Others have a more sober take: for all the excitement, Web3 does not actually exist. As Elon Musk put it in a tweet: \u201CHas anyone seen web3? I can\u2019t find it.\u201D Sure, we have plenty of cryptocurrencies and NFTs; we even a multitude of dApps and DAOs \u2013 but the Web3 promise is that these will attract such overwhelming numbers of users that they will usher in a new phase of digital life. The term \u201CWeb 2.0\u201D described a shift that had already happened, but Web3 is merely a forecast \u2013 and a bullish one at that. In 2021, Meta, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet reported combined annual revenues of $876bn, up 29 percent year-on-year. With the resources and expertise at these companies\u2019 disposal, what are the chances that a new wave of community-driven projects will gain such force they will displace the old guard? The open source movement has shown the limitations of rule-by-crowd \u2013 progress tends to be sluggish, and the user experience often not up to muster.There\u2019s also a good reason that centralised platforms emerged in the first place, as articulated forcefully by Moxie Marlinspike, founder of the messaging app Signal, in a January blog post. \u201CIn my mind the explanation is pretty simple: people don\u2019t want to run their own servers, and never will\u2026I don\u2019t think this can be emphasized enough.\u201D In other words, truly distributed infrastructure \u2013 which is what an ideal Web3 would depend on \u2013 may be a non-starter. And that\u2019s before we get to the debates around the environmental costs and computational inefficiencies of such a setup. As the software engineer Stephen Diehl put it on his blog: \u201CThe Ethereum virtual machine has the equivalent computational power of an Atari 2600 from the 1970s except it runs on casino chips that cost $500 a pop and every few minutes we have to reload it like a slot machine to buy a few more cycles. That anyone could consider this to be the computational backbone to the new global internet is beyond laughable.\u201D We asked him: does he not think the natural course of technological advance will ultimately address these shortcomings? After all, anyone living in the 1960s would have been wrong to write off a personal computing revolution simply because of the size and cost of existing computers. \u201CI don't think this is just like the early internet or somehow the march of progress will somehow fix it,\u201D he tells WIRED Consulting. \u201CYou solve this problem by doing one thing \u2013 by centralising it \u2013 at which point you've destroyed the entire premise of Web3.\u201D\nBut let\u2019s put those issues to one side for a moment. Let\u2019s imagine that Web3 materialises and the blockchain becomes the online master spirit. Would it actually cure the web\u2019s ills \u2013 or, as many fear, would the lack of central governance lead to a rise in hate speech, inappropriate content and criminal activity? There\u2019s a site called Web3IsGoingJustGreat.com which chronicles the crises and follies of the crypto world. At the bottom is a counter that shows \u201Ca running total of the amount of money lost so far to grifts and scams\u201D. When we last visited, the number was $10.896bn. Lavinia Osbourne, founder of Women In Blockchain Talks and creator of the Crypto Kweens NFT marketplace, tells WIRED Consulting that the answer will be legislation. \u201CYou don't have the same moderating element, but this is why regulation and compliance come into place,\u201D she says. \u201CDecentralisation is not the devil \u2013 it is how people choose to use it, just like the internet, just like the Bible.\u201D Right now, how those laws would work is a matter of conjecture. \u201CThey don\u2019t exist yet because the infrastructure\u2019s not there yet. Until you have the problem, you can't create a solution to it. If you try and preempt it, then that means sometimes you can be a little bit too heavy handed.\u201D\nDetractors also question the premise that the Web3 model would necessarily lead to decentralisation. Why shouldn\u2019t it merely lead to concentrations of power elsewhere? The Wall Street Journal reports that 0.01 percent of Bitcoin users control 27 percent of all Bitcoin in circulation \u2013 would ownership of a DAO necessarily be any different? And when organisations such as cryptocurrency exchanges are so important in the crypto ecosystem, wouldn\u2019t they just become the new tech giants? Certainly the billions of dollars in venture capital flows driving the current Web3 mania seem incompatible with the idealism: VCs tend to want the enterprises they back to end up making a lot of money. Hence Twitter founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s broadside in December. \u201CYou don\u2019t own \u2018web3.\u2019 The VCs and their LPs do,\u201D he tweeted. \u201CIt will never escape their incentives. It\u2019s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label. Know what you\u2019re getting into\u2026\u201DChris Dixon, the Andreessen Horowitz VC who popularised the term, responded:\n\u201Cfirst they ignore you\nthen they laugh at you\nthen they fight you 👈 we are here\nthen you win\u201D\nIT'S TELLING HOW VIGOROUS the debates about Web3 can get. Partly that\u2019s because to talk about it is a discussion about politics as much as technology.\nThe early web was wrapped up in a profound conviction that it could mend humanity. The zeitgeist was captured neatly by the digital-rights activist John Perry Barlow in his 1996 paper \u201CA Declaration Of The Independence Of Cyberspace\u201D:\n\u201CWe are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity\u2026We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.\u201D\nIn the years that followed, the prevailing tone of the tech world shifted away from that kind of utopianism. But Web3 has spurred a revival; to true believers, the web once again holds the promise of salvation. And that element of faith \u2013 faith that Web3 will happen, faith that it will restore digital life to its prelapsarian state \u2013 perhaps offers a useful way to consider our original question: is Web3 the future?\nLike most doctrines, it surely contains a kernel of truth. Whatever your views on it, this Web3 moment at the very least signals widespread discontent with the current state of the internet \u2013 and brings home how pressing it is that this must be tackled. \u201CBut these are not technical problems, these are problems of business design and policy,\u201D the futurist Gerd Leonhard tells WIRED Consulting. In his view, the aims of Web3 \u2013 privacy, encryption, bringing power back to users \u2013 are therefore not going to be achieved by introducing \u201Csome miraculous technology\u201D. He expects that meaningful solutions will come in more conventional form than blockchains. These might be new regulations that insist on making user data portable, say, or simply the proliferation of business models that don\u2019t incentivise companies to watch and track our behaviour online. \u201CWe're going to start paying for things like search engines and social media sites,\u201D he says. \u201CThis payment-based approach is going to really make a very big difference. The model of surveillance is dying, because we are moving into a world where in 2030, we're going to have roughly nine billion people on the internet. Today it\u2019s 4.6 [billion]. So you can only imagine that if we perfect surveillance and tracking, then we're gonna live in a total panopticon. That's just not going to be good for anybody.\u201D\nWe would venture that another truth of Web3 is that blockchains aren\u2019t going away. So, might \u201CWeb3\u201D ideas \u2013 digital currencies, NFTs, dApps \u2013 gain further traction while centralised internet businesses continue to exist? That doesn\u2019t seem like a stretch. Clearly, the notion that the internet has distinct \u201Cversions\u201D is an artificial construct.Perhaps, then, a more useful question than whether Web3 is the future is: which blockchain-based projects are the ones that really matter? In his 2005 essay \u201CWhat Is Web 2.0\u201D Tim O\u2019Reilly reflected on the dotcom bust, and how it sifted the wheat from the chaff among early internet companies. When bubbles burst, he argued, \u201Cthe pretenders are given the bum's rush, the real success stories show their strength, and there begins to be an understanding of what separates one from the other.\u201D If the crypto economy weathered a similar shakeout, which \u201CWeb3\u201D ideas would live on?\nChances are, the survivors would offer something that wouldn\u2019t be as effective in non-blockchain form, and which would present the user with an overwhelmingly good reason to use them instead of more traditional alternatives. The successful projects are also likely to be the ones where the technicalities fade into the background, and notions of blockchains are as far from the user's mind as HTML or DNS. The user doesn't care if an app's \u2018decentralised\u2019 \u2013 they just want it to work.\nIf such apps do materialise, they may do things we can't conceive of yet, in the same way as somebody using a home computer in the 1980s could not have imagined what problems that tool would end up solving. We might think we know what Web3 or Web 2.5 or Web 10 \u2013 or whatever you want to call it \u2013 will look like. But nothing ages as fast as the future.\nFor more information about WIRED Consulting, visit consulting.wired.co.uk\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","post_cover":null,"author":"BY CHARLIE BURTON","title":"Is Web3 Really the Future of the Internet?","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/web3-future-internet\/","tags":["","WIRED CONSULTING"]},{"date":"10.17.2022","summary":"Valentin Broeksmit tried to exploit crypto vulnerabilities to squeeze money out of thin air. The catch is, he couldn\u2019t cash out.","post_content":"FEW THINGS CAN turn around a boring winter afternoon like receiving a billion dollars. The amount is there, in its 10-figure glory, glaring from my phone screen in white characters against a charcoal background: $1,112,172,834.\nVisions of WIRED\u2019s gift and hospitality policy float before my eyes: Staff may not accept \u201Cgifts, meals, discounts, travel expenses\u201D over $30. I\u2019d had no plans to become a billionaire. And yet the man messaging me on Signal has decided that sending me a billion dollars in cryptocurrency is the best way of proving his point about the legitimacy of a crypto app. His plan is to exploit a possible vulnerability in a cryptocurrency wallet app to squeeze money out of thin air, and in the process, expose the app as either shoddy or fraudulent. A few minutes earlier, he had written that he wanted to become an \u201Calchemist.\u201D\nHis name is Valentin Broeksmit. His own balance exceeds five trillion dollars.\nI\u2019ve heard of Broeksmit before: A musician and founder of a band called Bikini Robot Army, in press shots he affected the indie-singer look as a lanky man in his forties wearing shades and a fedora. His real claim to fame, however, was as a financial whistleblower. In 2014, after the death of his father, Deutsche Bank executive William Broeksmit, Broeksmit Jr. began to leak a trove of documents on the bank\u2019s inner workings to journalists and FBI agents. While the value of his material has rarely been questioned, his sometimes erratic behavior is notorious. He\u2019s tweeted documents (which he retrieved on Reddit) that had been stolen in North Korea\u2019s 2014 Sony Pictures hack, eliciting the company\u2019s ire; The New York Times reported that he met with US congressmember Adam Schiff to help him investigate Donald Trump\u2019s finances in 2019; he was reported missing by his girlfriend in 2021, and was technically still a missing person when we spoke.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nHow Meme Detectives Stop NFT Fraud\nEarly in the day after he makes me a theoretical billionaire, Broeksmit calls me from his loft in downtown Los Angeles. The three-hour conversation is one of the oddest in my life: Broeksmit spins a story of financial derring-do, spiced with fast-paced tangents about his favorite pub in London and the org chart of the KGB. His live-in partner, visual artist Marie Peter-Toltz, occasionally chimes in\u2014sometimes in Spanish\u2014to dispute the sequence of events. The call ends and restarts several times, once because Broeksmit\u2019s cigarette has burned a hole in his pillow, filling his loft with down feathers. Broeksmit comes across as a skilled raconteur, but also erratic and impulsive. The pooled balance of several different crypto coins, amounting to a billion dollars, is still in my wallet. How did he do it?\nBroeksmit tells me he and Peter-Toltz had started looking into crypto in the winter of 2021 because they were \u201Cbroke as shit.\u201D During his research, Broeksmit chanced upon Incognito Wallet, which developed a blockchain where people can exchange and trade cryptocurrencies via peer-to-peer payments or through a decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows cryptocurrencies to be swapped directly without going through intermediaries. Run by an anonymous team mostly based in Vietnam, Incognito styles itself as privacy-conscious, open source, and decentralized.\nIncognito also lets users mint their own cryptocurrencies, Broeksmit says. One just has to pick a name and ticker symbol and provide information about the purpose of the coin in order to launch it as an asset tradable within Incognito\u2019s ecosystem. Incognito suggests that businesses can create these coins to drum up publicity or dole out promotional rewards to customers. Normally, these coins appear to have a value of zero dollars, as no one is seeking to trade them for pricey mainstream cryptocurrency on Incognito\u2019s exchange. But Broeksmit says he thought he could create new coins and then manipulate the market to make them valuable\u2014in his view, a version of the true ethos of cryptocurrency. \u201CEvery time you read someone with a philosophy about a coin, it\u2019s bullshit,\u201D he says. \u201CIt\u2019s like you\u2019re saving the world or your token means something, but it\u2019s just to make money.\u201D So he set out to follow, wide-eyed, in the footsteps of many in crypto before him who had bragged that their wit had made them a fortune.\nSo Broeksmit minted a series of coins inside Incognito. One is called parsec\u2014a unit of astronomical distance infamously misused in Star Wars\u2014and another BRA, after his band. A third is called \u201Cdrone algo red 41 coin.\u201D Then, he says, he set out to increase the value of his coins by trading them back and forth, creating \u201Cliquidity pools\u201D so that Incognito\u2019s algorithms adjusted the custom coins\u2019 prices accordingly. Finally, he linked his tokens into \u201Cdaisy chains\u201D connecting to Incognito\u2019s native token PRV, and then to mainstream cryptocurrencies. The tangled result, he claims, was similar to structures seen in conventional financial markets. \u201CBasically what we had here was a derivative. That was my father\u2019s thing\u2014derivatives,\u201D he says.\nBroeksmit spent four days building his financial matryoshka, locked in the only room with a door in his open-space loft: the bathroom. He claims to have invested a sizable amount in mainstream cryptocurrency\u2014including bitcoin, ether, monero, doge, tether, and BNB\u2014to prop up the prices of his own coins, but refuses to say how much.\nDespite all his pumping, by December none of Broeksmit\u2019s tokens had taken off, and their prices remained low. He wrote off the project as a waste of time. But on the morning of January 9, 2022, Broeksmit opened his Incognito wallet, and everything changed. \u201CI was a trillionaire,\u201D he says. He thought his magic had finally worked: All the tokens he had traded boasted multibillion valuations. He says he leaped off the bed and started banging on the bathroom door, shrieking \u201CEmergency!\u201D to alert Peter-Toltz, who was inside, that a portentous event had happened.\n\u201CI was very scared, because I thought that would obviously draw a lot of attention,\u201D Broeksmit says. Then reality set in: This number could not be right. \u201CI know I didn\u2019t put in a trillion. I don\u2019t have anything close to that in my liquidity pools.\u201D Yet, the app kept showing an astronomical valuation for his coins, which he thought proved that he could game the app, or that it was a scam. But when Broeksmit tried to trade his parsecs and drone algos for bitcoin, ether, or BNB, and then presumably cash them out, Incognito returned an error message: \u201CNo trade route found.\u201D He says the same message appeared when he tried to exchange one of his custom coins for another. (The same error appeared when I attempted to trade my billion, which was mainly in parsecs.) \nThe right thing to do, given the fact that the value attributed to his coins was not correct, he says, would have been to alert his FBI contacts, as he thought these loopholes could be abused by money launderers. Or, more simply, to shame Incognito for its shoddy design, and for its blocking of trades in contravention of its professed creed of decentralization and free trade.Still, the trillions beckon to him. It is an amount so ludicrously eye-popping that even cashing out a fraction of it would be life-changing. While he says a part of him\u2014the rational part\u2014knew that the value was likely illusory, the mirage of suddenly becoming rich was irresistible. \u201CI thought I could\u2014I can\u2014figure out a way to keep it somehow. That was when I became just like everybody else. That was my tragic, stupid error,\u201D Broeksmit says. \u201CI got greedy.\u201D\nThe Scramble to Empty the Wallet\nIn a way, what Broeksmit is doing is part of an honored crypto tradition, the industry\u2019s unwritten principle that if your coding skills leave you vulnerable to hacks and thefts, you have only yourself to blame. On the blockchain\u2014the decentralized, leaderless ledger where cryptocurrencies trade\u2014there are no such things as thieves, just smart people finding novel ways of using a certain product.\nIn June 2016, that attitude was tested when a decentralized venture capital fund called The DAO launched on the Ethereum blockchain, and users exploiting a loophole in its code spirited away some $50 million in crypto. In response, some members of the Ethereum community shrugged, implying that the attackers had done something allowed by the code, hence legit; others advocated for a rewriting of blockchain history that would return the missing funds. The latter faction won the day, but the \u201Ccode is law\u201D ethos survived in other parts of the ecosystem, such as decentralized finance, or DeFI.\nDuring our first three-hour phone call, as Broeksmit explains how he had sent me the billion, I am unsure whether he\u2019s taking the whole affair as an intellectual exercise. His motives seem fluid: He wants to take Incognito down; he implies that a Russian spy ring might be running the app; he thinks \u201Cit\u2019d be great to be a trillionaire.\u201D He swears he would be content with a million dollars, $100,000, $50,000, $10,000, or even $500. \u201CAnything I can get out would be great,\u201D he says. He clearly needs the money.\nCrypto alchemy is a last-ditch attempt to fund a custody battle Peter-Toltz is fighting over her son, who until recently had lived with her and Broeksmit. \u201CWe needed to make money to pay the fucking lawyers,\u201D he says. He says that Peter-Toltz and her ex-husband had clashed over Broeksmit, who has a history of substance abuse, being in the son\u2019s life. (Peter-Toltz\u2019s ex-husband did not reply to requests for comment via email and on social media.)\nBroeksmit appears to believe that I can help by drawing attention to his campaign to prove that something is rotten in the fair kingdom of cryptoland. He and Peter-Toltz had already started a full-on PR offensive, creating multiple discussion threads on Incognito\u2019s forum demanding that the Incognito developers make it possible to trade his custom coins to allow them to cash out; Peter-Toltz had left comments laced with French curse words. Incognito\u2019s baby-faced, spiky-haired community manager Jared Maxwell assured them that action to look into the matter would be taken\u2014but it never was. Broeksmit then took to Twitter, broadcasting his newfound riches to the world and giving away millions to whoever asked in a bid to create a critical mass of theoretical crypto-moguls eager to join his fight. \u201CWe can get everyone to complain until they do something about it,\u201D he says. \u201CThen everyone\u2019s gonna be happy and everybody wins.\u201DBetween January and February, Broeksmit\u2019s messages become a fixture of my life. Some are just screenshots of his trillion-dollar balance, or of a particular post on Incognito\u2019s website. Sometimes, he calls me at odd hours, adding pieces to the puzzle of his tale of attempted crypto-alchemy.\nOn one of those calls, Broeksmit tells me that when he realized his predicament, he decided to ask his FBI \u201Chandlers\u201D for help\u2014though how they could\u2019ve aided him was unclear. He says he shared a four-hour tape, surreptitiously recorded, in which he spoke at length about the case to three people, presumably FBI agents, who sounded sympathetic but noncommittal about getting involved. An FBI spokesperson says she has \u201Cno information to share\u201D when reached for comment about the circumstances of the meeting. Eventually, in April 2021, Broeksmit resolved to \u201Cgo missing\u201D in an attempt to help Marie\u2019s custody claim.\n\u201CI formulated a plan,\u201D he says. \u201CIf I am gone, they won\u2019t be able to mention me in court.\u201D In fact, Broeksmit just spent around three months in his bedroom, staying out of sight.\nA Fistful of Worthless Coins\nBy February, Incognito appears to crack down on Broeksmit\u2019s coins. I can see that play out in my own wallet too: Over the course of just five days I\u2019ve gone from billionaire to the owner of a mere $200 million worth of coins. Broeksmit starts to complain that the pots of crypto underpinning the exchange of token pairs are also being \u201Cdrained.\u201D On the forum, Incognito\u2019s Maxwell announces a new criteria for verifying custom tokens and the creation of a five-person verification committee, in order to avoid scams. The move seems to be directly targeting actors such as Broeksmit.\nBroeksmit sounds incensed. He says he is convinced that Incognito is run by Russian operators and starts to bombard Maxwell with messages in broken Russian, hoping to smoke him out. (I find no evidence of any ties between Incognito and Russia.)\nBut Broeksmit is not the only one to be affected by the foundering of his scheme. A startup founder going by Deivisson, whose crypto token had also skyrocketed to a multibillion-dollar valuation before being frozen and falling down vertiginously, says that Incognito \u201Ctarnished\u201D his company\u2019s image. \u201CWhat am I going to tell my private token investors?\u201D Deivisson says. In fact, his token\u2019s value had single-handedly been inflated by Broeksmit. \u201CI don\u2019t have the heart to tell him that it was just Marie and I trading his coin,\u201D Broeksmit says.\nIt is undeniable that in Incognito, Broeksmit has found a worthy match. Getting a straight answer from team members\u2014nearly all anonymous, as it often happens with crypto developers\u2014is borderline impossible; getting a polite one is harder (when I reach out to Grant Hawkins, formerly the company\u2019s public face on YouTube, he entreats me to \u201Cdo something constructive\u201D rather than write my \u201Cdumb fucking article.\u201D)\nBut after nearly a month of chasing, in mid-February Maxwell answers my questions in writing. His answers shed some light on the saga of Broeksmit\u2019s trillions. In short: The app calculates custom tokens\u2019 prices by taking wild guesses based on the number of tokens and how they have been traded. \u201CWithout organic realistic trades on the app there can be no accurate display of value,\u201D Maxwell says, adding that Incognito plans to remove that algorithmic price guess \u201Cin the future.\u201D In other words: Broeksmit\u2019s manipulation had likely fooled the app\u2019s algorithms to display a preposterous value. But the app is just a flawed interface grafted over a small blockchain: There are no trillions to harvest. And even if there are, Incognito is not really a decentralized finance product. It is an app on which its developers exert centralized control\u2014they prevent the coins from being traded and then introduce new verification rules to stave off further unrest. Incognito was never a realistic target for crypto-heists like Broeksmit\u2019s.When I present this very mundane answer to him, Broeksmit is unconvinced.\nHe keeps creating new tokens, watching their value skyrocket, then deflate a few days later. But the reality of what is going on eventually catches up with him. As of February 19, the balance of his wallet is zero. (So is mine.) His rage toward Incognito is monumental. He says he has paid some of his friends and acquaintances with custom coins, and that now those people are angry at him. \u201CIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201D he says.\nAlongside his custom tokens, he says he\u2019s lost all the money\u2014in mainstream cryptocurrencies\u2014that he had invested in the first place to pump up his custom currencies. In one of our calls, I again try to get an exact figure for his losses, but he won\u2019t say. \u201CI can\u2019t tell you right now, Marie will get pissed off,\u201D he says. Peter-Toltz, in the background, proposes leaving the room, but Broeksmit stops her. \u201CJust everything we had,\u201D he adds.\nThen, things go quiet for a few weeks, barring the occasional text.\nOn April 5, I receive a call at 6 pm London time. It is Broeksmit. He sounds upset. Everything is lost, he says. They\u2019ve lost the court case, they\u2019ve been evicted from their loft. Most importantly, Peter-Toltz is missing. \u201CWe were parking to go sneak into our house\u2014and now I just can\u2019t find Marie,\u201D Broeksmit tells me. \u201CShe\u2019s gone.\u201D I suggest Peter-Toltz might have gone to stay with some friends. \u201CFriends? We don\u2019t have friends now,\u201D he says.\nIt is now clear that Broeksmit had fallen in love with a mirage. Buffeted by personal adversities and financial difficulties, he had grasped for a miraculous fix and found the get-rich-quick delusion that permeates the worst corners of the cryptocurrency world.\nCourt records later uncovered by Motherboard show that a day after our last interaction, on April 9, Broeksmit is arrested and placed under a restraining order, forbidding him from getting close to the loft again. A \u201Cghost gun\u201D with no serial number is found in his car. He is released shortly afterward. He again enters the property four days later, on April 13. Then, a long period of silence\u2014until April 23, when someone texts me from Broeksmit\u2019s Signal account. It isn\u2019t him. The text reads: \u201CMarie has been found and now we need to find Val who is missing.\u201D I ask who is writing. No one answers.\nOn April 25, Broeksmit\u2019s lifeless body is found on the grounds of a high school, not far from where he had previously lived. An investigation on the cause of his death is pending, but initial police reports rule out foul play. The LAPD officer in charge of the inquiry does not reply to a request for comment via email. Marie Peter-Toltz, despite what the anonymous texter told me, is currently a missing person according to the California Department of Justice, and she hasn\u2019t replied to my texts, emails, and Twitter direct messages. Inevitably, Broeksmit\u2019s death has become fodder for a cottage industry of conspiracists, striving to see in the death of a one-time whistleblower the work of some evil cabal.\nBut I feel I knew the man behind the whistleblowing persona, who would often delight in asking about mundane things like my dating life between sharing wild claims and tall tales. The news of his death shocks me. Broeksmit\u2019s plan for crypto alchemy had backfired, and sent him down a spiral that ended with his life being cut short. I\u2019m left with a story I had promised to write, piecing it together by going through reams of texts and emails and hours of conversations with a man who desperately wanted to be taken seriously.\n\u201CBe kind to us when you write about this,\u201D one of Broeksmit\u2019s final texts reads. \u201CPlease, write me fair.\u201D","post_cover":null,"author":"BY GIAN M.

But this one is strange.\nBinance revealed Friday that unidentified hackers managed to exploit a flaw in the company's BNB Chain crypto token, allowing them to mint 2 million of the company\u2019s decentralized tokens worth a total of $569 million. That money wasn\u2019t actually stolen from Binance, in other words, but rather fabricated out of thin air thanks to a flaw in the security of Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency. But the hack nonetheless seemed poised to flood the market with BNB and thus reduce its value for legitimate owners, while allowing the hackers to walk away with half a billion dollars.\nUnfortunately for those hackers, even they didn\u2019t seem prepared for their sudden windfall. Cryptocurrency-tracing firm Elliptic found that they quickly traded away some fraction of their tokens for a variety of other cryptocurrencies. That allowed them to obtain about $53 million in Ethereum-based tokens. But other cryptocurrencies that they traded their BNB for, like Tether and USDC, are more centrally controlled, allowing the funds to be frozen. Binance, meanwhile, managed to temporarily shut down its BNB blockchain to prevent the hackers\u2019 newly mined currency from moving further. \u201CSo we have a very sophisticated exploit, managing to mint yourself $569 million,\u201D says Elliptic research lead Thibaud Madelin. \u201CBut what followed was a complete shambles, to be honest.\u201DIn the end, Elliptic believes the hackers kept hold of less than 10 percent of their loot\u2014not bad for a day\u2019s work but little more than a blip in the wild world of digital money.\nFeds Warn Hackers Breached a US Military Network\nA joint advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the FBI, and the NSA warned that the network of an unnamed military agency or contractor had been breached by a so-called \u201Cadvanced persistent threat\u201D hacker group, an industry code phrase for state-sponsored hackers. According to the alert, the spies maintained their access inside the network for around 10 months, penetrating a Microsoft Exchange server where they installed a commonly used backdoor known as China Chopper. The hackers also used a tool called Impacket to move from machine to machine and another tool called CovalentStealer to siphon data from their targets. As is often the case with government alerts, the advisory didn't attribute the breach to any particular country's government, nor even a known hacker group. The eagle-eyed (or vulture-eyed) Register spotted that the advisory initially included a box at the top suggesting organizations \u201Cprotect against Russian-state sponsored malicious cyber activity,\u201D which was later deleted. But others, like cybersecurity firm AttackIQ, point to Chinese calling cards in the intrusion.\nA Modified Tor Browser Is Tracking the Location and Browsing Histories of Chinese Users\nSince early this year, hackers have been distributing a tainted version of the Tor Browser that collects personal data about Chinese users including form data they submit, browsing history, location data, and computer name, according to security firm Kaspersky. The Tor Browser is meant to be an anonymity-focused tool that is often used in countries like China where users are seeking to circumvent government-imposed internet restrictions, tracking, and censorship. Kaspersky found that the attackers advertised the malicious app by including a link to download it in a video posted to a popular Chinese-language YouTube channel. The video has more than 64,000 views. The installer for the malicious browser includes a compromised version of Tor that siphons victim data and sends it to attackers.\nIsabela Fernandes, executive director of the nonprofit Tor Project, told CyberScoop that there is now a patch available. \u201CBasically this \u2018poisoned\u2019 Tor Browser modifies the update URL so it cannot be updated normally. What we did was to add a redirect so we are responding to the modified URL, this way people will update.

That was the experience of cofounder, Sandra Wirström, who suffered life-changing postpartum injuries following a medical misdiagnosis. \u201CWhen I was pregnant, I had instant access to health care, a good understanding of the different trimesters, and hundreds of apps to choose from,\u201D adds Kristensen. \u201CWhen my pregnancy ended, so did the focus on me as a woman: All the health care, information, and apps shifted to the baby.\u201D\nLEIA, founded in 2021, aims to redress that balance. Its post-pregnancy health app is a personalized digital tracker for new mothers. \u201CBy building screening models for postpartum depression and pelvic dysfunction, we can identify women at risk at a much earlier stage\u2014even before health care providers,\u201D adds Kristensen.

But even as those global sanctions have carefully excised Russia from global commerce, millions of dollars have continued to flow directly to Russian military and paramilitary groups in a form that\u2019s proven harder to control: cryptocurrency.\nSince Russia launched its full-blown invasion of Ukraine in February, at least $4 million worth of cryptocurrency has been collected by groups supporting Russia\u2019s military in Ukraine, researchers have found. According to analyses by cryptocurrency-tracing firms Chainalysis, Elliptic, and TRM Labs, as well as investigators at Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, recipients include paramilitary groups offering ammunition and equipment, military contractors, and weapons manufacturers. That flow of funds, often to officially sanctioned groups, shows no sign of abating and may even be accelerating: Chainalysis traced roughly $1.8 million in funding to the Russian military groups in just the past two months, nearly matching the $2.2 million it found the groups received in the five months prior. And despite the ability to trace those funds, freezing or blocking them has proven difficult, due largely to unregulated or sanctioned cryptocurrency exchanges\u2014most of them based in Russia\u2014cashing out millions in donations earmarked for invaders.\n\u201COur aim is to identify all the crypto wallets being used by Russian military groups and the people helping them; to find, seize and block all this activity that is helping to buy the bullets, the ammunition of this occupation,\u201D says Serhii Kropyva, who until recently served as deputy of Ukraine\u2019s Cyber Police and advisor to the country\u2019s prosecutor general. \u201CWith the close cooperation of companies like Chainalysis and Binance, we can see all the wallets involved in this criminal activity, these money flows of millions of dollars. But we can, unfortunately, see that the transfer is continuing all the time.\u201D\nFEATURED VIDEO\nA Timeline of Russian Cyberattacks on Ukraine\nIn separate reports, the cryptocurrency-tracing firms and Binance\u2019s investigations team each tracked donations to the Russian war effort that very often began with public posts on the messaging app Telegram soliciting crowdfunded donations. Chainalysis, for instance, found Telegram posts from organizations including the pro-Russian media sites Rybar and Southfront, as well as the paramilitary group Rusich\u2014which has ties to the notorious Wagner mercenary group\u2014all posting cryptocurrency donation addresses to Telegram. These posts told followers that the money raised there would be used for everything from weaponized drones to radios, rifle accessories, and body armor. In another instance, Chainalysis points to a fundraiser by a group called Project Terricon that attempted to auction NFTs to support pro-Russian militia groups in Eastern Ukraine, though the NFTs were removed from the marketplace they were hosted on before any bids were placed.\nBinance\u2019s investigations team, in its own report, found that a total of $4.2 million in crypto had been funneled to Russian military groups since February. The groups named in its research didn\u2019t entirely overlap with those named in Chainalysis\u2019 report, suggesting that the overall funding could be far greater than either Binance\u2019s or Chainalysis\u2019 total. Binance, for instance, points to a pro-Russian \u201Ccultural heritage\u201D group known as MOO Veche that has carried out fundraisers for military equipment similar to the kinds funded by the groups Chainalysis flagged. While Binance, TRM Labs, and Elliptic all name MOO Veche as a major fundraiser, Elliptic traced $1.7 million in crypto donations to the group, far more than the other researchers.A screenshot of a Russian-language Telegram post from the pro-Russian military MOO Veche group, describing equipment paid for with its fundraising, including \u201Cthermal imagers, binoculars with rangefinders, spotting scopes, car radios, collimators and first aid kits.\u201C\nTELEGRAM VIA ANDY GREENBERG\nOther organizations that Binance spotted raising money through cryptocurrency crowdfunding on Telegram include the pro-Russian nationalist groups Save Donbas and REAR, as well as the Russian arms manufacturer Lobaev, which it saw directly soliciting donations on the platform. Yet another group, known as Romanov Light, whose fundraising was spotted by TRM Labs and Elliptic, claimed to be collecting crypto for Russian special forces. Romanov Light raised as much as $330,000 worth of donations, according to Elliptic, which it told donors it spent on military equipment like weapon accessories, flashlights, and armor plates.\nDespite the relative clarity of all that financial tracing, preventing cryptocurrency from continuing to bolster Russia\u2019s unprovoked incursion into Ukraine hasn\u2019t been simple. Exchanges can block or freeze funds at the points where they\u2019re exchanged for traditional currency. But according to Chainalysis, the majority of the crypto funds the groups have raised have been cashed out through what the company calls \"high-risk\" Russian exchanges with little to no precautions against criminal money-laundering. In previous reports, Chainalysis has named Chatex, Suex, and Garantex as examples of those Russia-based rogue exchanges\u2014all of which have already been targeted with Western sanctions for their extensive use by criminals. Chatex and Garantex did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. Suex no longer appears to have a public website, and no contact information for the exchange could be found.\nNot every exchange that has served as an ATM for Russian military crypto crowdfunding is hosted in Russia, however. Blockchain analysts who spoke to WIRED pointed to seven other exchange services, some hosted in India and China, that have received funds from the pro-Russian groups they tracked, though they declined to name them on the record, in part because the amounts of those funds in most cases were in the single-digit thousands or less.In one telling example of how hard it is to prevent these cash-outs, however, analysts saw MOO Veche send more than $150,000 worth of bitcoin to an exchange hosted on the infrastructure of the Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi\u2014a \u201Cnested\u201D exchange that essentially uses Huobi as its trading platform. But any responsibility that Huobi might have for blocking or freezing those funds was complicated by another unknown intermediary service that analysts saw the money travel through before entering the Huobi-hosted service. When WIRED reached out to Huobi for comment, it wrote in a statement that it has a \u201Cknow-your-customer\u201D process \u201Cwhich ensures to the best of our ability that our clients\u2019 source of funds are above board.\u201D\nBinance, for its part, says its exchange accounts were also used by four of the groups it tracked and received more than $208,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. It tells WIRED that it froze all four accounts it discovered. \u201CWe\u2019re making sure that no harm comes to civilians as a result of the fundraising that happens in these extremist spaces,\u201D says Jennifer Hicks, who manages Binance\u2019s intelligence and investigations team. \u201CWhen cryptocurrency exchanges know that something illicit is happening that will end in real-world, kinetic effects like this, it\u2019s the exchange\u2019s responsibility to put a stop to it as fast as possible.\u201D\nEven when exchanges do monitor for crypto sent from sanctioned groups like these pro-Russian fundraisers, that dirty money won\u2019t always be straightforward to detect, warns Thibaud Madelin, who leads research at Elliptic. He says he\u2019s increasingly seeing Russian sources of illicit funds use \u201Cbridges\u201D or \u201Ccoin swaps\u201D\u2014services that allow easy trading of one cryptocurrency for another, often without offering any identifying information\u2014as money-laundering techniques. He\u2019s watched those tools grow in popularity among dark-web black markets and cybercriminal users and expects the same will happen with those seeking to launder illicit arms funding. \u201CIt\u2019s a bit early to say definitively. But what we\u2019re seeing is that it\u2019s likely to become a bigger problem,\u201D says Madelin. \u201CThey\u2019re likely to mirror the methodologies seen across dark net services users, enabling large-scale money laundering and potentially sanctions evasion.\u201D\nAn image in Chainalysis\u2019s report pulled from a pro-Russian social media fundraiser that shows items funded through cryptocurrency donations, including targeting equipment, drone components, and satellite radios.\nCOURTESY OF CHAINANALYSISMillions of dollars in cryptocurrency funding to Russian troops may be the least of Ukraine\u2019s problems in a war where Russia has thrown billions into its invasion force. Ukraine, it\u2019s worth noting, has also vastly out-raised Russia in cryptocurrency: By Elliptic\u2019s count, the Ukrainian government has collected more than $77 million in crypto donations since the war began. But that is to be expected, given the West\u2019s broad support of Ukraine following Russia\u2019s unprovoked aggression and the global sanctions placed on Russia. And even the smaller amount of cryptocurrency Russian forces have raised demonstrates cryptocurrency\u2019s ongoing potential to circumvent those sanctions and offer another financial lifeline to Russia\u2019s war machine.\n\u201CIt\u2019s not like Russia is buying new tanks with this money.

Google for Startups is helping new entrepreneurs to build on that historic success","post_content":"CITIES ACROSS CENTRAL and Eastern Europe, from Warsaw to Tallinn to Kyiv, are fertile ground for tech startups. Early success stories such as Skype, developed in Tallinn, LogMeIn (now GoTo), founded in Budapest, and UIPath (founded in Bucharest and launched on the NYSE last year at $30bn), have helped foster a dynamic ecosystem.\nGoogle for Startups\u2019 Joanna Nagadowska says the region\u2019s tech sector is being driven by a \u201Cpositive flywheel\u201D as it matures, with savvy and seasoned local talent now launching their own startups. \u201CCentral and Eastern Europe today is not an overnight success. It was built on a generation of entrepreneurs who know how to start and scale businesses.\u201D\nWe\u2019ve highlighted five key Central and Eastern Europe cities, including Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital\u2019s tech sector has such momentum that it continues to grow, despite the Russian invasion. Warsaw remains the region\u2019s tech hub and a number of Ukrainian startups have satellite offices in the city. Tallinn births more startups per capita than anywhere in Europe, while Vilnius has leveraged its liveability to develop a vibrant tech ecosystem. Prague has global credentials in developing cybersecurity tech, but boasts a growing and quickly diversifying startup scene.\nKyiv\nBefore the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv was the rising star of the European startup scene. It was the launch site for six unicorns, from GitLab to NFT pioneer Unstoppable Domains and workflow automation star, AirSlate\u2014the latter two went unicorn this summer.\nThe IT sector is still growing in Ukraine, with many startups opening satellite offices in other countries, particularly Poland. Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the $5m Google for Startups Ukraine Support Fund, providing cash awards and mentoring support.\nElai.io was one of the first beneficiaries of the Ukraine Support Fund, and was launched in Kyiv last year by Vitalii Romanchenko, Alex Uspenskyi and Aleksey Pshenichniy, all relative veterans of the Kyiv tech scene.\nLeveraging advanced AI, Elai.io\u2019s Software as a Service tool allows users to easily create videos using just text, putting words in the mouths of digital avatars. It offers a library of templates and animations, works in over 65 languages, and the avatars are based on a diverse range of real-life actors.\nRomanchenko argues that despite the vitality of the startup scene in Kyiv, and the depth of talent in the city, there is need for more outside investment. \"Kyiv is home to thousands of skilled engineers and IT professionals,\u201D he says. \u201CWe have people who know how to build awesome products while working in big offshore businesses but a lot of time we lack individuals who actually start their own companies. We need help with building a stronger startup ecosystem, and getting more VCs and angels involved to support early-stage companies.\"\nThe Google for Startups Campus in Warsaw\nANNA LIMINOWICZ\nWarsaw\nGoogle for Startups opened its Warsaw Campus back in 2015, since then almost 100,000 startups and community members have visited. The city has also become a satellite base for Ukrainian tech firms, with Google for Startups providing workspace for firms in temporary exile. \u201CThe Google for Startups Campus in Warsaw is our hub for Central and Eastern Europe. It was built on a strong commitment to support this incredibly diverse startup ecosystem with its almost 200 million people across over a dozen countries. Especially in Poland we see an emerging number of unicorns like Allegro or Docplanner, fuelled by a solid pipeline of rising stars like Booksy, Brainly, ICEYE, Tylko or Packhelp. They are all testament to the strong momentum we see for Eastern European startups today.\u201D says Michal Kramarz, head of Google for Startups, Central Europe.\n\"We strongly believe our platform will change how primary care is delivered,\" says Agata Mlodawska, content lead at Polish startup Infermedica. The HealthTech startup, an alumn of the Google for Startups programme, has a mission, she adds, to \"make healthcare accessible, affordable and convenient by automating primary care processes, from symptom to outcome\".Mlodawska says the city\u2019s tech scene now needs to pick up on Google for Startups\u2019 approach to shared growth. \u201CWe need more tech and growth meetups to share knowledge and experience, not only on technology but also about sales, scaling, building company culture and hiring.\u201D\nVilnius\nPut simply, the Lithuanian government is extremely startup-friendly, and the capital, dotted with accelerators, has cultivated a close-knit business community. The pandemic has seen Lithuanians return to the capital from around Europe, and the city is also welcoming disgruntled tech talent from neighboring Belarus.\nFintech is a particular strength, but the city\u2019s startup ecosystem is deep and broad: take the mobility platform Trafi; Blockchain banking platform Bankera; and fashion resale marketplace Vinted \u2014 its first unicorn.\nVilnius-based Kamilė Jokubaitė is cofounder and CEO of Software as a Service platform Attention Insight, which uses eye-tracking and AI to create attention heat maps, helping companies to make their landing pages, marketing and packaging as eye-catching as possible. Jokubaitė, who is a Google for Startups alum, explains that \u201Cwe are forming a new niche in the market which perceives AI as our colleague\u2014a way to do our work better, not as a threat taking over our jobs.\u201D\nJokubaitė says Vilnius-based startups are a perhaps a little too reticent and slow to claim the attention they deserve. And argues that the Google for Startups programme has been a confidence booster and a space to share successes and failures. \"The program united cofounders into peer groups where we share our knowledge and experience of overcoming challenges,\" she says. \"It enables founders to create new products and projects without repeating mistakes.\"\nTallinn\nTallinn is a small but mighty tech-sector powerhouse, leading the rest of Europe in terms of startup creation and VC investment per capita. The customer relations management platform Pipedrive, and mobility app Bolt\u2014both unicorns\u2014are just two digital headliners launched in the Estonian capital. But it is Skype, developed in Tallinn in 2003, that established a model for the tech sector\u2019s development as well as creating a funding and talent ecosystem that helped launch successive waves of startups in the city, including Transferwise (now known as Wise), Pipedrive, robot delivery specialist Starship Technologies, and the identity verification service, Veriff.\nLaunched in 2015, Veriff verifies customer identity using AI-powered factors including facial recognition, and behavioural and technological indicators, that show an individual is who they say they are. Its founder, Kaarel Kotkas, had previously worked in verification operations at Wise. Three years after launch, Estonian VCs named Veriff Startup of the Year 2018.\nPrague\nPrague is becoming one of the best places to start up or scale your business in Central and Eastern Europe. \u201CPrague and other cities, such as Brno, are not only fantastic places to live in, but the overall startup ecosystem is picking up in terms of its overall maturity, access to smart angel, VC and PE capital along various verticals, meaningful connections to corporations and other actors of importance, an emerging community of founders and dedicated accelerators, and a quality pool of human capital,\u201D says Petr Vítek, the cofounder of Impact Hub Prague, which is a Google for Startups partner. \u201CIt is great to see these developments materialize not only in unicorns such as Rohlik or ProductBoard, but also other awesome startups\u2014which we will hear a lot about soon!\u201D\nFor more information about Google for Startups' offering, visit startup.google.com\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/65e9c2ef0005e91d03ed0857\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/WiredxGFS_WebHub4.jpg","author":null,"title":"Showcasing Eastern Europe\u2019s Major Innovation Engines","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/sponsored\/story\/google-for-startups-eastern-europe\/","tags":["","BRAND LAB","PROMOTION","GOOGLE"]},{"date":"09.29.2022","summary":"Local law enforcement isn\u2019t ready to deal with this new type of fraud, even with shady scams on the rise.","post_content":"WHEN CHRIS GOLAS called the cops to report that he had been the victim of crypto crime, he was met with total incomprehension. \u201CPeople didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about,\u201D he recalls.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/6334eca358ae5223de143021\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/crypto-crime.jpg","author":"BY JESSICA RIZZO","title":"Are You a Victim of Crypto Crime?

The crypto research and developer community would agree on what a change looks like, coders would type out a command and time-stamp it, developers on the client side would download these bits of code, and then at the predetermined time, the system would manifest the change by itself\u2014in this case, the Merge. It changed how transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are verified, a much-delayed upgrade that has been hailed as a major moment in crypto land.\nThat doesn\u2019t make the current landscape of crypto apps, and the blockchain technology they\u2019re built on, any less complex for the average individual. Buterin seems mostly aware of this. In the lead-up to the Merge, he collated some of his earlier essays about crypto into a book titled Proof of Stake: The Making of Ethereum and the Philosophy of Blockchains. Given how quickly crypto technologies are changing, the book already feels slightly outdated, peppered with coins and DAOs that may no longer exist and concluding in an essay from January 2022, just before the crypto market tanked. But the collection serves as a kind of crypto Old Testament, a historical record and first-hand account of a mind-shift toward decentralized networks that inspire a host of lofty promises.\nFEATURED VIDEO\nInside the Largest Bitcoin Mine in The U.S.\nWIRED\u2019s global editorial director, Gideon Lichfield, and senior writer Lauren Goode spoke with Buterin over Zoom about the recently burst crypto bubble, whether decentralized technology can support society-scale decisionmaking, and what next great innovation may follow the Merge. The conversation has been edited and condensed.\nGideon Lichfield: So I guess congratulations are due on the Merge. How do you feel it has gone?\nVitalik Buterin: I'm definitely happy, and definitely relieved. This is a transition that the whole Ethereum community has been working towards for the last eight years. Along the way there have been a lot of people\u2014whether from the Bitcoin community, or people skeptical of crypto in general\u2014who have doubted whether or not the Merge, this switch to proof of stake, would happen. We're very happy to have proven all of them wrong finally.\nThe WIRED Guide to the Blockchain\nThe idea of creating tamper-proof databases has captured the attention of everyone from anarchist techies to staid bankers.\nBY WIRED STAFF\nGL: Just to boil things down really simply, the presumed advantages of proof of stake are that it uses much less energy and has lower barriers to entry, so there's less risk of centralization. It's more secure against attacks. But what would you say, in lay terms, are the biggest opportunities that proof of stake opens up?\nI think there are a few. One of them is from the economic resources that the ecosystem no longer has to spend on proof of work. All kinds of projects are going to have somewhat more resources than they did before.Another is the greater legitimacy the switch to proof of stake gives to Ethereum. A lot of institutional actors, whether it's governments or corporations, their biggest reason to be skeptical of or not want to use Ethereum has been the proof of work and environmental aspect. After the Merge, Ethereum is not a proof of work network anymore, and that makes people who had those kinds of concerns a lot more willing to use it now. There\u2019s probably going to be a lot of people who have been quietly on the sidelines who now are going to come in and start using Ethereum.\nA third one is that proof of stake is an opportunity to redesign the protocol in a lot of ways. Probably the biggest problem that people have with blockchains\u2014outside of proof of stake or their practical ability to use them\u2014is scalability. Sending transactions is expensive, because blockchains are not very scalable. The reason why is this architecture where every node in the network has to personally verify every single transaction. We have ideas around technologies to fix that and turn Ethereum into a system that processes transactions in a way that's still decentralized, but a lot more efficient.\nLauren Goode: You sort of answered my next question, which is, what is the next biggest innovation we can look for post-Merge? Can you give a specific example of developers building something that they weren't able to build, or build efficiently, before?\nScaling is really the big one. Ethereum has what we call this two-layer scaling model, and the plan is to upgrade it a little bit, by making it possible for the chain to process a much larger amount of data. And then there are these separate protocols that take that data as an ingredient and create kind of like mini-Ethereums inside of Ethereum, on top of that. These together would be able to process a much larger number of transactions. Instead of the roughly 20 transactions per second that Ethereum can process today, potentially between 5,000 and a 100,000 transactions.\nA bunch of work needs to happen in the Ethereum ecosystem on building these layer-two protocols. And the Merge makes it much easier. The transition to scalability is probably the next big thing that the Ethereum ecosystem is doing after the Merge. It's, in my opinion, equally exciting. It could be equally as big of a game changer.\nGL: How do you think the crypto crash of this year affects Ethereum now, in the wake of the Merge?\nMmm, it's a good question. I have, I think, said publicly on a couple of occasions that to some extent I look forward to the bear market. One of the unfortunate things that's happened around crypto, especially in the 2020 and 2021 bubble, is that it got big before it was really mature enough to handle the level of attention it was getting. If you look at the chart of how much energy Ethereum consumed, I think more than half, maybe more than two-thirds, was within the last two years. If the Merge had happened two years earlier, things would be even better, and if it got delayed by another five years and it happened after another really big crypto bubble, things could have been vastly worse.That\u2019s also true from the scalability point of view. Transaction fees on Ethereum got up to $5 and even $20 [per transaction] last year, and if there is another big price bubble we could easily see fees go up to $100 or $200. In that kind of a world, talking about the promise of crypto as a way of empowering the third world, banking the unbanked, supporting people who are marginalized by existing institutions, just clearly starts looking ridiculous.\nI've always really wanted to solve scalability properly before the next big rise in adoption and attention on the ecosystem happens. One of the saving graces of prices going down for a while is that we are going to get an opportunity to be able to do that. Proof of stake does not reduce transaction fees, but it is the big thing that we've had to get out of the way before we can go full steam ahead on doing the stuff that will.\nLG: Your last essay in the book, written in January 2022, is about NFTs. Since then the market has changed dramatically. How confident are you in some of the ideas that you were exploring, like the \u201CProof of Attendance Protocol\u201D? For what it\u2019s worth, event ticketing seemed to be one of the more valid uses of NFTs. But the market for NFT art has just cratered.\nMy take on NFTs is the same as it was a year ago, which is that I think the NFTs that are going to be sustainable are the NFTs that are going to be useful. In the beginning stages, there is tradable art and cat pictures, and a lot of that stuff really has cratered. For an NFT to have lasting value there needs to be some benefit of holding it other than just being able to say that you hold it.\nThe most successful NFT use case so far, and it's been so successful and pervasive that people don't even think about it as NFTs, is ENS domain names. I'm sure last year you saw a lot of people on Twitter putting up dot-ETH names. I still have Vitalik.ETH. Those names are NFTs that are in the wallet of a particular address. If you have that NFT, then if I want to send someone Ether, or interact with them through some Ethereum application, then I can put in their dot-ETH name. It\u2019s really convenient to do that\u2014the same sort of function that domain names on the internet or usernames have in any kind of chat application\u2014except in this big decentralized Ethereum ecosystem.\nAnother interesting use is the whole NFT gaming space. Games like Axie Infinity were really successful last year, but then Axie Infinity got hacked. Even aside from that, it hasn't really been able to recover. The reason for that in my view is that the people who designed these first-generation NFT games approached it with the attitude that the financialization aspect by itself was enough to make the game fun. But that\u2019s clearly not enough, and a successful NFT or play-to-earn game itself needs to be fun even without the monetization aspect. Whoever figures out how to make a blockchain game that is a fun game first, those are the kinds of projects that are going to win.","post_cover":"https:\/\/media.wired.com\/photos\/632ea7cf8990652479ff39d3\/3:2\/w_1280%2Cc_limit\/BUTERIN_BIZ_GettyImages-1238606759.jpg","author":"BY LAUREN GOODE","title":"What\u2019s Next for Ethereum After the Merge","url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/whats-next-for-ethereum-after-the-merge\/","tags":["","BITCOIN","BLOCKCHAIN","CRYPTOCURRENCY","FINANCE","MONEY","REGULATION","ENCRYPTION"]},{"date":"09.23.2022","summary":"Plus: The Supreme Court in cyberspace, what\u2019s up with Web3, and ghost town resurrections.","post_content":"HI, EVERYONE.
