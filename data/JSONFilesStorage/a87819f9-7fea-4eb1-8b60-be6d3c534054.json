It provides an infrastructure for developers to build protocols that can be utilized by fund managers and accessed by the retail investor population in a seamless manner.A $100 million ecosystem fund, supported by DWF Labs, has been established to incentivize developers to build on ZIGChain. With each new protocol, we get closer to our goal of enabling wealth generation for everyone.Wealth generation describes the process of creating, growing, and preserving financial resources. It usually involves “making money work for you” through smart investments that generate consistent returns over time. Sounds simple enough, right?Not in reality. Traditional financial systems have made it almost impossible for the average person to access wealth-generation opportunities. As a result, the wealth gap continues to widen, with 1.10% of the world’s adult population controlling 46% of global wealth, as of 2023.The factors contributing to the global wealth gap can be categorized into:Zignaly has spent six years attempting to address the limited access to wealth-generation opportunities. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we expand financial opportunities globally while remaining inclusive, user-friendly, and compliant with regulatory bodies.Hundreds of thousands of our users have collectively generated millions of dollars in profits by investing alongside top digital asset managers. The user-friendly interface and various sets of tools allow investors to make all of the profit with none of the stress.But we are just one wealth generation protocol. Imagine if hundreds of similar protocols were available to the masses. Imagine if there was an infrastructure that made it easy for builders to create these protocols and for users to access them. Well, that infrastructure is here…Introducing ZIGChain, a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain on the Cosmos Network, designed to revolutionize financial empowerment through scalable and inclusive wealth generation infrastructure.Developers can build innovative wealth generation protocols, fund managers can deploy them into accessible investment strategies, and the average person can take advantage of financial opportunities previously reserved for the wealthy elite — all on ZIGChain.ZIGChain unlocks a world where any user, regardless of financial literacy, social status, or geographic location, can generate wealth by clicking a single button. Wealth management services can now be built on top of any DeFi protocol, so users get all the benefits of Web3 but with a familiar and user-friendly interface.Let’s find out how ZIGChain’s architecture simplifies wealth generation.ZIGChain is being built on the powerful Cosmos SDK as a modular blockchain. Today, Cosmos is one of the fastest-growing infrastructures for new Layer 1 blockchain with high scalability, interoperability, and an easy-to-implement modular framework.Cosmos is a proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain that involves staking to secure the network and validate transactions. So yes, we can finally confirm that ZIG holders will be able to stake tokens for huge rewards, and we are excited to share more details on this very soon.Choosing Cosmos enables a fast transition from idea to implementation while maintaining reliability. The developer-friendly tools and libraries in the Cosmos SDK make it the ideal choice for launching a blockchain that values security, flexibility, and speed.Moreover, the modular framework means ZIGChain’s functionality can be integrated in the core of the blockchain and expanded to meet users’ and developers’ evolving needs. It also allows seamless integration with existing blockchain ecosystems, creating a powerful network effect.Cosmos enables us to deploy an “app-chain” design that allows our core concepts of accessibility, transparency, and inclusivity to form a wealth management layer (WML) that sits between builders and the everyday investor.This WML is the DeFi manifestation of Ziganly’s pooled accounts investment technology whereby users may choose to pool their funds with expert wealth managers who manage their investments. Here are just a few of the benefits that this app-chain design enables on ZIGChain:“Effortless investing” has been our motto since Day 1. So, it shouldn’t be a surprise that ZIGChain has a user-friendly UX that enables anyone to participate in wealth generation practices without prior knowledge or expertise.But such a seamless user experience doesn’t mean a lack of advanced features. ZIGChain comes equipped with new-age technologies, including account abstraction and Gasless technology, to make Web2 and Web3 composability a reality.ZIGChain opens the door to a future where just one button stands between a user and wealth generation. Soon, Web2 users will use their email accounts or social logins to integrate with on-chain protocols and invest in wealth management services by clicking a single “INVEST” button.Zignaly and DWF Labs have joined forces to establish a $100 million ecosystem fund to promote the adoption of ZIGChain. The fund will primarily incentivize and support developers in creating innovative wealth-generation protocols on ZIGChain. We are also joined by UDHC, Disrupt & score of other partners in this journey.Our message to our fellow builders is simple:The support for builders on ZIGChain doesn’t stop there. Developers will be prioritized in our network’s resource allocation and rewarded with a share of the core blockchain revenue. Such an approach ensures the growth and sustainability of our ecosystem as a whole.Moreover, ZIGChain is partnering with various entities to enable smart contract functionalities, both EVM and Rust, on the L1. Developers of all levels and backgrounds can build wealth-generation protocols on ZIGChain without sacrificing creativity or innovation.ZIGChain marks the beginning of a new chapter in Zignaly’s journey. A testnet version of ZIGChain will be launched this summer, with more details on the overall governance structure and incentive programs for early contributors, validators, and users to follow in the upcoming weeks.With major partnerships being forged, ZIGChain, as a shared mindset of some of the biggest names in the industry, is set to disrupt the status quo and usher in a new era of financial freedom for everyone — and it’s all happening in 2024.","creation_date":null,"tags":["Blockchain","Zignaly","Bitcoin","Defi","Decentralization"],"author":"Zignaly","category":null}
