The collaboration focuses on developing AI-powered blockchain products, engaging the community and enhancing the ecosystem.\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology is seen as a way to address the centralization concerns surrounding AI development. While tech giants have advantages in data access and computing infrastructure that facilitate AI model development, this also raises issues about the centralization of control over data.\nBlockchain technology, with its decentralized ledger systems, offers a potential solution to democratize access to AI technologies that are currently limited to a few large corporations. By combining AI capabilities with blockchain’s decentralized architecture, aelf and AgentLayer aim to empower a wider range of innovators and developers to create AI-powered applications and services within the Web3 ecosystem.\nA high-performance layer 1 optimized for AI integration \naelf is a layer 1 blockchain network designed to power the development of Web3 applications. It offers a modular architecture with features like parallel processing, cross-chain bridges and a mainchain-sidechain model to deliver high throughput, scalability and interoperability. aelf aims to revolutionize the blockchain space by fostering a smarter, self-evolving ecosystem through its support for decentralized AI integration. Developers can build DApps and smart contracts using aelf’s SDKs in various programming languages, and its AI-enhanced architecture enables efficient distribution and rebalancing of computational loads.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\naelf is partnering with AgentLayer, a layer 2 blockchain network designed to coordinate autonomous AI agents, to enhance its AI capabilities of the blockchain and support a more robust AI agents ecosystem. Together, aelf and AgentLayer aim to jointly transform AEVOLVE Labs into a cutting-edge decentralized AI hub for open research, project incubation and acceleration to drive the sustained growth of the decentralized AI ecosystem. \naelf and AgentLayer anticipate the emergence of advanced decentralized AI agents, data networks and compute infrastructures that will drive innovations that are not feasible with each technology operating independently. Moving forward, the partners will focus on developing a comprehensive suite of core layer 1 (L1) and layer 2 (L2) projects, decentralized computing networks and AI agents. Employing AI agents to automate and verify smart contracts can reduce human errors and biases, leading to more reliable and fair agreements.\naelf and AgentLayer are focusing on creating a comprehensive decentralized AI stack.

The goal of the IAO model is to promote the creation, distribution and management of AI assets in a transparent, secure and decentralized environment.\nCash in on the booming decentralized AI agent ecosystem\nThe primary goal of the partnership between aelf and AgentLayer is to integrate AI capabilities into aelf’s blockchain network to create a more intelligent, self-evolving blockchain ecosystem. Emphasizing the importance of the collaboration, aelf founder Auric stated:\n“This alliance goes beyond technology. It’s a commitment to creating an ecosystem where AI and blockchain not only coexist but thrive together to deliver unprecedented solutions.”\nBy harnessing the potential of AgentLayer’s autonomous AI agents with aelf’s high-performance layer 1 blockchain, the two companies aim to set the stage for a transformative leap in decentralized AI infrastructure. “As aelf and AgentLayer navigate toward a decentralized future, our joint efforts are poised to transform the technological landscape by merging blockchain with AI capabilities, ushering in a new era of more robust, secure and intelligent decentralized AI agents,” commented professor Liu Yang, co-founder of AgentLayer. “This approach lays the foundation for a more interconnected and automated world, promising unprecedented opportunities for innovation and collaboration in the digital age.”\nLearn more about aelf and AgentLayer\n#Blockchain\n#Partnership\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.
