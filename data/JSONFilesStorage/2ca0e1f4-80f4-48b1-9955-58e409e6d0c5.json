This evolution has been marked by the rise of digital currencies, the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and an increasing focus on blockchain technology’s potential to revolutionize industries beyond finance.\nAmid this backdrop of innovation and change, Changelly has established itself as a prominent player, offering secure and efficient crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto exchanges to over 7 million users worldwide.\nIn this interview, Changelly CEO Jake Cormack — a seasoned fintech expert and global capital market specialist — shares his insights on steering the platform through the evolving crypto landscape, highlighting the importance of user-centric services and Changelly’s role in the broader industry’s growth.\nCointelegraph: Changelly is celebrating its ninth anniversary this year. How do you see the evolution of the crypto and broader blockchain industry over the last decade?\nJake Cormack: In the last decade, we witnessed Bitcoin’s rise, the birth of altcoins and the growth of the DeFi and nonfungible token (NFT) sectors that reshaped the landscape. Despite crypto winters, key market player crashes and the collapse of crypto-centric banks, the blockchain industry has persevered.\nToday, institutional adoption has increased, although regulatory hurdles remain. Efforts have been made to address the scalability and interoperability of crypto solutions, while the high energy consumption of mining has raised environmental concerns. Overall, the industry has undergone a significant transformation propelled by technological innovation, expanding use cases of crypto and evolving regulatory landscapes.\nCT: Comparing 2015 to today, what are the most significant changes in crypto users’ behavior?\nJC: The top three changes include wider mainstream adoption of crypto globally, broadening use cases of digital assets and an expanded demographic getting involved in the crypto sector. We see a deeper understanding of the industry thanks to educational initiatives that upgrade user knowledge beyond Bitcoin\nBTC\n$63,002\nand Ethereum. Besides, users started to prioritize security and custody solutions. Their regulatory awareness has also grown.\nDue to the increasing demand for crypto payments, merchants across various industries are searching for payment partners. In response to this demand, we introduced Changelly PAY last year.\nCT: From DeFi to NFTs to metaverse — the crypto industry is never short of innovation and new trends. As an established crypto exchange, how does Changelly adapt to these shifting trends?\nJC: As a market veteran running this marathon for nine years, Changelly is driven to stay ahead of the curve, adapting to changing trends by expanding its product portfolio and list of supported cryptocurrencies and enhancing the customer experience. We have partnered with over 500 crypto companies across various industry niches, from Web3 gaming to pure DeFi, and we are always ready to dive into new areas.\nAs a CeDeFi ecosystem, Changelly aims to merge the best technologies and attributes of both financial systems, granting innovative and convenient Web3-based products with lower fees, improved security, greater accessibility, faster speed and optimized customization.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nCT: What is your take on DeFi and decentralized exchanges (DEXs)?
