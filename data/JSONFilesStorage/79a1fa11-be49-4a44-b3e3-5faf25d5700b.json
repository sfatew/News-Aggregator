Introducing the World’s First Affordable Decentralized Smartphone","detailed_content":"APhone is the first decentralized cloud smartphone with a mobile operating system that’s compatible with any device and capable of turning any old handset into the latest powerhouse smartphone.Imagine having instant access to another smartphone inside your current handset.Now, imagine that smartphone inside your phone is one of the most powerful smartphones on the planet, allowing you to play the latest games, use any Web3 dApp on the go, and farm crypto 24/7.That’s what APhone is.It’s the world’s first decentralized smartphone on a mission to redefine Web3 mobile connectivity and break down barriers to entry into the Web3 industry by removing hardware limitations and centralized app store restrictions.With a use case for everybody, APhone’s mission is to open Web3 to the mobile world.APhone is the world’s most powerful decentralized cloud-based smartphone. Born from the latest advancements in the DePIN sector, APhone leverages Aethir’s infrastructure to provide a cloud-based smartphone that lives as a progressive web app on your phone’s home screen — ready to be called upon at the tap of a finger.The decentralized smartphone elevates your hardware’s capabilities with immense processing power, gigantic storage capacity, and a top-tier GPU — all streamed straight to your device. APhone provides these features through its collaboration with Aethir’s DeCloud solution, putting the power of DePIN right inside your pocket!Best of all, the APhone is competitively priced, making it an affordable solution for underprivileged societies or those requiring multiple smartphones. It provides an option to get started in the Web3 world from just 0.003 SOL for a Trial Card — no more spending $500 on an expensive smartphone every two years.APhone works on all devices — whether a PC, Android, iPhone, or tablet — guaranteeing peak performance to handle the most demanding tasks or play the highest-quality games. The infrastructure for APhone is facilitated through cloud virtualization, which creates a virtual replica of the latest Android phone using software to simulate hardware.Using containers and hypervisors (a software layer that allows multiple operating systems to share a single hardware host), APhone delivers unparalleled power to these devices through Aethir’s dedicated cloud-based GPU and top-tier CPUs. For technical users, APhone leverages the Qualcomm 865 and RK358.The cloud virtualization process allows APhone to provide a multitude of mobile device capabilities consolidated into a single device, providing everyone with an additional advanced mobile experience inside their original phone.With APhone, users can explore Web3 from anywhere in the world. We’re on a mission to do our part in onboarding the next billion users to Web3. We’re using APhone to serve as the gateway to a new mobile era in Web3, empowering individuals with the capabilities of blockchain and decentralized applications.APhone provides a new avenue to enter the Web3 world for millions of people through its cloud-based technology, democratizing access and allowing everyday mobile users from across the globe to participate.By breaking down the barriers to entry, APhone enables all types of users to push their devices to the limit without putting any strain on the physical hardware. As a result, those with older smartphones can enjoy the latest games, applications, and smartphone features as if it were the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy.Furthermore, APhone brings accessibility to the Web3 world for the millions of users who face geographical restrictions or processing power constraints when trying to utilize Web3 apps on their hardware devices. With centralized app stores making it difficult for Web3 games to get published, APhone is working to escape the limitations and break away from the chains of these centralized services. Instead, developers can easily have their Web3 games and dApps pre-installed on all APhone devices, making them instantly accessible to all APhone users.“For lots of people who can’t afford the Saga phone in places like Mexico, Brazil, and Vietnam, Aphone lets them access the Web3 ecosystem from any device,” — APhone CBO William Peckham.New users looking to access the APhone need an invite code. If you have friends who are already using an APhone, you can ask them for an invite code. Alternatively, you can head to our Telegram or Discord channels and request an invite code.Once you have your invite code, go to APhone.com, press “Enter App,” and enter the code, or access the device through the invite code link.Once logged in, any new user can deposit 0.003 $SOL to cover the gas fee for a free 7-day trial.For the full APhone experience, users are required to active an APhone NFT — granting them a year’s worth of access to the decentralized smartphone.The NFT can be purchased during our minting rounds or launchpad sales, so be sure to follow our social media channels to be alerted for the next opportunity.About APhoneAPhone is the first decentralized cloud-based smartphone that utilizes DePIN to provide an unparalleled mobile experience to Web3 users.Leveraging Aethir’s robust decentralized physical infrastructure network, APhone lives as an application on your device’s home screen, providing a gateway to a new era of mobile Web3.The decentralized OS features an index of pre-installed Web3 dApps, allowing users to circumvent the gatekeeping from centralized application stores.
