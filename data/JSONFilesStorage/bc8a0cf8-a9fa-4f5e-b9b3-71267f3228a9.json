The occasion reduced mining rewards from 6.25 Bitcoin\nBTC\n$63,026\n per block to 3.125 BTC, worth about $200,000 at the time of writing.\nAt the Token2049 event in Dubai, Cointelegraph spoke with community members to get their thoughts on the Bitcoin halving and its potential impact on the crypto space.\nAttendees of the recent Token2049 event in Dubai.

From a technological standpoint, Gün Sirer argued that the halving was not great. He explained:\n“As a technologist at my core, I see Bitcoin halving as not a great thing. Why? Because it’s a discrete event. All of a sudden the rewards going to miners go down by half. And suddenly, the security budget of the Bitcoin system goes down by half.”\nThe executive believes that the halving leads to “hundreds of millions” being paid to miners going down. Gün Sirer argued that this means less money secures the network.\nThe Avalanche founder believes that the Bitcoin creator was still “alive,” the Bitcoin halving might change. He explained:\n“I think if Satoshi were alive today, he would change the way the halvening is happening, not from a discrete function, from a sudden point function to a more continuous function, so that the rewards go down more gradually.”\nWhile the executive thinks that the halving could improve from a tech perspective, Gün Sirer also recognized that the event has had a good effect on crypto.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions. The event kicked off with a glamorous red carpet walk, followed by opening remarks from the Phemex founder.\nThe evening featured a range of activities, including expert insights from prominent figures, such as Cointelegraph CEO Yana Prikhodchenko, who shared her perspective on the growing trends in crypto media. A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard. She also offered valuable insights into the innovative features of Pulse and the newly launched Phemex Lending Protocol.\nWhen asked about Pulse, the SocialFi platform launched in March, co-founder Stella Chan shared their plans: “Pulse shifts the paradigm from the tightly controlled and centralized framework of traditional social media to a user-empowered experience. It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\n“This creates a lot of speculation, a lot of buying into the space, a lot of people taking a position in Bitcoin, which in general has been great for the rest of the space as well,” he added.\nGün Sirer explained that it’s also great for renewed interest in crypto and predicted that the space is on its way to growing tenfold. “I see the crypto space growing by at least another factor of 10, if not more so. Bitcoin has a lot of growth ahead of it, in my view.”\nNo immediate impact\nWhile Gün Sirer highlighted the potential long-term growth of the crypto space, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph that the halving might not immediately affect the price. Ardoino explained:\n“I think the halving is something that is iconic, is something that is there, but not necessarily will affect immediately the Bitcoin price.”\nEven though the executive thinks the halving might not affect the BTC price, Ardoino remains bullish on the potential impact of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n“I don’t expect it. Maybe it will happen, maybe it will not. But I think that the Bitcoin halving was priced already. What was not necessarily priced was the enormous interest in the Bitcoin ETF,” he added.\nRelated: Here’s how crypto game Notcoin onboarded over 30M users — founder\nArdoino explained that the biggest hedge funds didn’t tap into the Bitcoin ETF yet. When pension funds and other hedge funds start investing, the executive said, “We’ll see big moves.”\nCode is law in crypto\nWith the ETFs bringing in new players to the crypto space, the halving shows how code works as the law in crypto, according to Justin Hyun, the director of investments at The Open Network (TON) Foundation.\nHyun believes that those experiencing the Bitcoin halving for the first time will see how the crypto space works. He explained:\n“It’ll be a further validation of. The way that the code is ultimately the law in crypto, as in this thing that was pre-designed from the get-go, takes place without anybody having to push a button.”\nThe executive hopes that when the larger community outside crypto sees this, they will become more curious about different networks and how they interact with the code and users.\nMagazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.
