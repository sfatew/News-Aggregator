Transitioning blockchains from their isolated nature toward a more interoperable framework presents significant hurdles, necessitating solutions that concurrently address privacy, security and scalability.\nExisting blockchains are either fully transparent or fully anonymous, and neither solves the trust problem. The standard transaction output of layer-1 protocols is limited, with the original blockchain processing only seven transactions per second. Moreover, L1s are not designed to be interoperable by themselves.\nDeveloped by a group of well-known scientists with 35 years of research and 15 years of practical implementation experience, Partisia Blockchain is designed to tackle these issues and become a sustainable ecosystem that enhances building opportunities for developers.\nSolving the current challenges in blockchain L1s\nPartisia Blockchain is an interoperable messaging protocol that aims to solve the 3 biggest challenges in the blockchain space via the unique features it offers. The protocol employs a scalable sharding architecture, customizable multiparty computation (MPC) and tokenomics that allow for paying gas with other tokens than its native token.\nCreated by the project’s co-founder Ivan Damgård, who is also the inventor of Merkle-Damgard hash construction used in Bitcoin\nBTC\n$62,997\n, customizable MPC offers an auditable privacy layer on top of which private data are computed. By allowing the processing of data without knowledge, it ensures the reliability and authenticity of the computation while preserving privacy. The zero-knowledge (ZK) variant technology enables a trust system that helps tokens, both transparent and anonymous, to thrive.\nIts sharding architecture provides an opportunity for multiple blockchains to work independently but simultaneously. The messaging layer facilitates state synchronization by carrying transaction information from one blockchain to another. Whenever there is a need for additional output, a new block may easily be created, thus providing true horizontal scalability.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nVarious blockchains within the Partisia ecosystem are rendered interoperable owing to its gas mechanism. Liquid tokens of different blockchains can be used to pay for gas on Partisia, enabling wider interaction opportunities.\nThe integration of liquid tokens allows for the development of a unique staking model. MPC, Partisia Blockchain’s token that has recently been listed on multiple exchanges, functions as a governance and collateralization token within the blockchain. Users that are eager to participate in blockchain governance stake MPC and earn staking rewards in return. Stakers may opt to be rewarded both in the blockchain’s native currency and other liquid tokens that are used for gas payment, such as ETH, MATIC, BNB and prominent stablecoins, including USDC and USDT.\nFurthermore, MPC is also used to provide protection for the ecosystem. On Partisia Blockchain, users may facilitate various transactions ranging from consensus and ZK computation to token bridging by using MPC as collateral.\nEnabling developers to create unique applications in the Web3 space\nThrough these value propositions, Partisia Blockchain empowers the creation of unique applications in the Web3 space that are currently not possible in other chains. The situation is evident in Partisia Blockchain’s current ecosystem map.\nPartisia Blockchain’s ecosystem map.
