The market is again experiencing volatile sentiments due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving and confirmed rumors about the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.Old blockchains and coins in the cryptocurrency market have already been well-studied. We all know what BTC and Ethereum (ETH) are capable of and what to expect from their development plans in 2024. We know that in 2023, many new blockchains were launched, including WB Network and BASE.While headlines in 2023 were dominated by Layer 2 Ethereum, zero-knowledge proof, and Bitcoin’s ordinal numbers, what significant stories can we expect to see in 2024?The rapid growth of Solana (SOL) towards the end of 2023, alongside the expansion of the Cosmos (ATOM) ecosystem through chains like Injective Protocol (INJ), suggests that the era of Ethereum dominance may be coming to an end.Despite the success of non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, smart contracts, and decentralized applications based on Ethereum continue to dominate, attracting the highest developer activity and Total Value Locked (TVL) statistics.While non-EVM chains will thrive, platforms that find ways to leverage Ethereum-based architecture will automatically gain good user adoption opportunities.Meanwhile, the gravitational pull of Bitcoin cannot be ignored. With only a few months left until the next halving and the countdown timer affirming the positive impact of approving a spot Bitcoin-ETF, things look promising for the king of digital assets.Bitcoin-Fi is already on the horizon, and tokens like Ordinals and BRC-20 may have just been the beginning. Let’s now turn our attention to blockchain projects that deserve your consideration.In 2023, the focus on security increased, based on the report from SlowMist Technology’s “Annual Report on Blockchain Security and Anti-Money Laundering for 2023.”According to the data, a total of 464 security incidents occurred in 2023, resulting in losses of $2.486 billion. Compared to 2022, losses decreased by 34.2% on an annual basis.The cryptocurrency industry has experienced ups and downs amid a tumultuous “crypto winter” and bear market. Governments and international organizations have adopted a more cautious stance, and cryptocurrency regulation policies in various countries are still gradually taking shape.The attention of cybercriminals towards the crypto industry necessitates a diligent and careful approach to security measures. To minimize threats, users should:The cryptocurrency market is largely driven by speculation and hype. As a result, new and innovative protocols often outperform established platforms that we are already familiar with.At the same time, this excitement and speculation make these new crypto assets much more volatile and high-risk. They may not be suitable for low-risk investment strategies.Let’s explore some of the most interesting and new blockchain projects that we can expect to see in 2024.Monad is a new Layer 1 blockchain that promises to deliver what any other Layer 1 blockchain promises. Like many others, it utilizes a Proof-of-Stake network, claiming greater scalability, security, and decentralization than its Web3 competitors.The main Celestia network, code-named Lemon Mint, was launched on October 31, 2023, successfully raising $55 million from venture capitalists, including Spartan Group, Jump Crypto, Blockchain Capital, and Polychain Capital.Functional compatibility has been one of the significant challenges facing cryptocurrency for many years. Connecting digital assets across chains can sometimes be a nightmare, associated with high fees, slippage costs, and a plethora of exploits and hacks.The Ordinals’ protocol is a system for numbering satoshis, assigning a serial number to each satoshi and tracking them through transactions.In simpler terms, ordinals allow users to make individual satoshis unique by adding additional data to them. This process is known as “inscription.”The last on our list of blockchain projects to watch out for this year is NEON. It joins our list of new and exciting blockchain protocols to watch in 2024. NEON EVM is a unique network aiming to give us the best of both worlds and permanently dispel Layer 1 maximalism.The cryptocurrency landscape is poised for new developments and challenges, fueled by anticipation surrounding the introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF, technological advancements, and the evolution of groundbreaking projects.Blockchain projects are increasingly prioritizing security, employing new protection methods, and creating secure spaces for users’ cryptocurrencies.Staying informed about intriguing new blockchain projects in the crypto space is a good way to stay ahead and learn about innovations before they become mainstream, ensuring users navigate the dynamic crypto environment with confidence.>Free Tool: Use our simple crypto profit calculator to calculate your potential profits and returns on your cryptocurrency investments.<<<Disclaimer: This article is meant for educational purposes and should not be taken as investment advice.
