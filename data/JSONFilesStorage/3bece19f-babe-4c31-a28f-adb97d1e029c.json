We’ve come to call this collection of spaces the “Blue Check Map.” Today, I want to share why I continue to expand this map and the long-term goals we have at HIDE ME PLEASE inc.Innovating Future Retail and Entertainment with the Blue Check Map and MR(Mixed Reality)Recent technology has been blurring the lines between our daily lives and societal boundaries, transforming our experiences. At HIDE ME PLEASE inc., we’re at the forefront of this change, using the Blue Check Map to integrate online and offline experiences through a new dimension of interaction. Consider how ‘Pokémon Go’ has globally motivated people to move between real locations, blending digital and real-world experiences. Our MR (Mixed Reality) experience is designed similarly, enabling users to engage directly in virtual interactions through the Blue Check Marks. For instance, when consumers using MR devices look at the entrance of a café adorned with a Blue Check, they can vividly experience the venue’s current promotions or signature dishes. Furthermore, by analyzing consumer purchase data and behaviors, we can offer personalized recommendations and tailored services, enhancing both customer attraction and marketing efficiency. MR technology not only transcends simple visits but also strengthens connections with the venues, elevating customer experiences to a new level.Commercialization Is Just Around the CornerMR devices are evolving into lighter, more user-friendly glasses. Companies like Meta and Apple are already developing this technology, which is on the verge of widespread commercialization. As mentioned, wearing smart glasses and looking at a Blue Check will display the venue’s signature and promotional menus directly on the screen. Additionally, these interactions can generate advertising revenue, which will be shared with our partner venues.A Win-Win for Venue Operators and ConsumersThe introduction of the Blue Check Map and MR technology brings significant changes to businesses. First, customer visitation increases due to the enhanced experiences provided by MR. This technology encourages more frequent visits and longer stays at venues. Second, these unique interactions are likely to be shared on social media, attracting more new customers and naturally inducing viral marketing. Lastly, the special experiences offered can prompt customers to purchase more products or services. As discussed in previous episodes, if my offline activities are linked online — imagine gaining experience points or items for your avatar online after enjoying a coffee at a venue. Wouldn’t you be tempted to order a dessert if it meant your online avatar would receive even greater rewards?The Future of MR and HIDE ME PLEASEThe expansion of MR experiences through the Blue Check Map will bring revolutionary changes to the retail and entertainment industries. We are ready to enhance customer experiences in unprecedented ways by partnering with a variety of businesses across sectors. As MR technology advances and becomes more accessible, our platform will establish more diverse and extensive partnerships. We aim to provide novel experiences at retail stores, restaurants, tourist attractions, and more. The increasing number of businesses adopting this technology through collaboration with the Blue Check Map will maximize the value of our services and add new enjoyment to customers’ daily lives. Looking ahead, we are prepared to build sustainable and valuable partnerships and are seeking sturdy partners and investors who share and support our vision. The future of MR is bright, and HIDE ME PLEASE inc. is committed to leading the way.In our next episode, I will talk about connecting the HIDE ME PLEASE service with gaming.Thank you for reading today, and I truly look forward to any interest in our business. We are eager to hear from you!\nE-mail : ixplorer@hidemeplease.xyz\n#hidemeplease","creation_date":null,"tags":["Nft","Food And Beverage","Metaverse","Mixed Reality","Blockchain"],"author":"Ixplorer","category":null}
