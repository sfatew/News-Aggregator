Failing to address this can be life-threatening for a protocol, when there are so many alternative projects and activities for a passerby to allocate their attention to. We’ve seen it time and time again: A project may have the best product or tech, but unless it’s easy to grasp or get into, no one will want to devote the energy required to understand it.How then to create the easiest onramp to an outside user? At HOO, the d’app and game side are made to take advantage of preexisting mechanisms and venues that the public already frequents in their day to day. Moreover, crucial concerns on the technical level (bridging, identity, etc) are abstracted at the point of interaction, meaning there are simply less things for a user to think about — this leaves time for them to get into what they’re after in the first place: an exciting, immersive activity blending a basic mix of fun and strategy. This is accomplished in a few ways:As native crypto users, the most commonly frequented apps you will likely see are Telegram, Discord, and of course, Twitter (now X). However, with 800 million users globally and a built in feature to port games (in addition to its own native blockchain), Telegram presents the best opportunity to expose HOO to a vast new audience of users while enabling an easy, mobile-friendly point of interaction. Already hanging with a few friends in a group chat? Why not open the HOO channel, and challenge your buddies to see whose gladiator is best?The same spirit involved in this will be supported through designated mobile store apps as well, and with discord embeds, enabling native venues that have their own users to begin with, to serve as sources of user growth and retention.Another hurdle to overcome is the challenge of technical stress and the litany of things that can and do go wrong within the crypto industry. How does one alleviate the stress normally associated with navigating 85 different chains, bridging solutions, and points of interaction? With HOO, we opted for a web based launcher, eliminating the need for a standalone downloaded client, meaning users can simply connect via a standard wallet, and begin playing, no additional time or equipment required. Finally and most critical to this area, while a user may have liquidity on a number of chains, they need not manually bridge or worry about how to pool funds. With HOO’s native $AMBR being designed as a LayerZero 0ft, despite the contracts for the infrastructure residing on BASE, users will be able to connect and play from any chain they happen to prefer.What’s next? With $AMBR’s TGE just around the corner, and the MVP for gladiatorial combat entering the testnet, there are numerous opportunities to qualify for HOO’s second round of airdrops, and to best situate yourself to take advantage of its growth.Make sure to follow our Twitter and join our Discord to learn about the latest offerings, the (soon to be announced) TGE and trading venue for $AMBR, and all the ongoing updates and developments!","creation_date":null,"tags":["Gaming","Blockchain","Crypto","Cryptocurrency"],"author":"The Halls of Olympia","category":null}
