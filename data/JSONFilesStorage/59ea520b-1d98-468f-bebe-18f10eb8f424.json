Users crave immersive and rewarding connections. The gap between digital identities and their impact on real-world benefits also hinders the potential of online commerce.\nJoining the digital with real life\nIn this digital landscape widely criticized for lacking engagement and tangible applicability, a new and exciting approach is paving the way for truly meaningful online interactions. This is Metropolis: a platform where digital collectibles unlock access to real-world rewards.\nThe Metropolis team envisions a future where the boundaries between the digital and physical worlds are dynamic, “where commerce, culture and entertainment converge seamlessly.” Their goal is to create an aesthetic-forward, next-generation cultural destination that is “entirely interoperable and accessible across a multitude of virtual and physical portals.” They are now gearing up for a token launch.\nMetropolis blends elements of commerce, gaming, SocialFi, art and culture. In this ecosystem, users can craft encompassing 360° experiences. At the core of this ecosystem lies a gamified marketplace called Metropolis X. It aims to reshape social commerce.\nUsers can unlock exclusive products, content and experiences in Metropolis.

Metropolis Marketplace is live, featuring weekly drops that grant users access to exclusive products, content, events and experiences.\nReimagined virtual interactions\nThe venture extends into Metropolis World, envisioned as the metaverse’s “capital city.” The gorgeously-designed city is populated with various neighborhoods to transform virtual interactions into immersive experiences. This metaverse generated over $2 million in the first 12 months following its Phase 1 launch.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

Source: Metropolis\nMetropolis has signed partnerships with over 400 notable creators and brands, including Yung Gravy, Steve Aoki, Christian Cowan, Blondish, Time Out and Bryan Brinkman. Together, Metropolis’ collaborators reach more than 300 million people.\nMetropolis is also participating in the Cointelegraph Accelerator. It has already demonstrated significant traction — 15-30% weekly revenue growth and an average spend of $18 per user. Metropolis has been dubbed “the StockX of blockchain” because it simplifies blockchain technology through an intuitive user interface that caters to a broad audience ranging from newcomers to veterans. What makes Metropolis even more accessible is a white-label software-as-a-service solution that enables companies and brands to seamlessly integrate into the digital realm. The platform has raised $1.2 million from a diverse group of stakeholders, including Outlier Ventures, Primal Capital, the chairman of the Tate, founders of Virgin Gaming, the ex-chairman of Deutsche Bank, Cointelegraph Accelerator and Lamina1.\nExpanding the ecosystem: Questing platform and 3D avatars\nIn Metropolis, a questing platform integrates the City and its marketplace through a series of quests and missions.\nMetropolis avatars will also be usable in other virtual worlds. Source: Metropolis\nFurthermore, Metropolis is developing fully interoperable 3D avatars that will be released soon. These avatars, designed for use both within Metropolis and across other virtual worlds, promise to offer a seamless and personalized digital experience.\nMetropolis’ roadmap charts an ambitious path in four phases toward a fully integrated digital ecosystem. Phase 1 introduces a questing platform featuring AI-powered lore quests and gaming commerce with real-life rewards. These features will leverage CLAY tokens for leveling up. In Phase 2, the focus shifts to 3D avatars, allowing users to create avatars for use across various platforms, including V-tubing capabilities, augmented reality (AR) experiences, custom filters and game integrations. Metropolis employs the ethos of “Build with us. Take anywhere.”\nPhase 3 further expands the virtual environment, introducing fully customizable property hubs and immersive 3D streets, which feel like extensions of social media profiles. Finally, Phase 4 comprises the development of ‘Future Cities,’ including the designed-to-scale City of Fire, Pixel, Earth, Space and Water, supported by a plug-and-play back end.\nMetropolis seeks to become more than an ecosystem. It stands as a blueprint for the future of Web3 — a future that is immersive, inclusive and interconnected. A visionary approach lays the groundwork for a world where the boundaries between the virtual and the real are blurred to redefine the common understanding of community, identity and engagement in the digital age.\nMetropolis is preparing for an upcoming launch on the PAID Network’s Ignition IDO platform, aiming to introduce new developments that will contribute to the platform’s 360° digital experience. The initiative welcomes public participation and is scheduled for April 16-17, starting at 11:00 am UTC.\nLearn more about the upcoming launch and Metropolis’ ecosystem here\n#Blockchain\n#Marketplace\n#Metaverse\n#Ecosystem\n#Web3\n#NFT\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.
