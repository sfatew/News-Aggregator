It also holds the key to unlocking AI’s full societal potential by enabling a truly open AI. In a world of AI solutions relying on performance battles of pre-trained AI models, ChatDKG stands for freedom of choice. A truly open AI approach allows anyone to define the trusted knowledge as the foundation for their AI solutions. It further extends the freedom of choice from trusted knowledge to multimodal support of a plethora of different AI models. For creators ready to take the plunge into the truly open AI future, an inception program is available to onboard them to ChatDKG.The currently prevalent approach in creating AI solutions is a siloed one — either in the shackles of a single AI model or a walled garden of external sources provided by a single organization. ChatDKG is breaking down those walls with an inclusive and open approach to creating AI solutions. Leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), it creates a neutral, inclusive knowledge foundation. As anyone publishes their knowledge to the DKG, their addition gets equipped with a timestamp, their identity, ascribed ownership, and verifiability proofs ensuring their knowledge is kept intact. Through a framework of decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), such knowledge is made available to any AI model as input to produce outputs that both have information provenance and respect data ownership. As trusted knowledge inputs become mission-critical for AI solutions, it ignites a knowledge economy where your knowledge network is your net worth.In addition to building trusted AI solutions with ChatDKG, participants in this new knowledge economy can get involved in growing the DKG in knowledge domains important to them. New types of autonomous knowledge networks can appear in any domain, narrow or wide, such as:Launching an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO) allows anyone to open up their mission to others who would like to join creating a knowledge foundation in that domain. Through an IPO, a paranet operator also ensures incentive rewards for participants that will add useful knowledge — knowledge miners. By accessing NeuroWeb network incentives for mining new knowledge, the paranet’s trusted knowledge grows in a crowdsourced way.The ChatDKG’s truly open AI does not only lower dependency on any single AI company, the freedom of choice of AI also ensures that any development in the field of AI models, prompt engineering, agent frameworks, or similar, is making your solution stronger. By putting the trusted knowledge foundation in the driving seat, the tech giants working on advancing AI systems are working in your favor as you are always able to use your knowledge network with the latest AI technologies.Those looking to build the next big thing with ChatDKG’s trusted AI solution or launch an Initial Paranet Offering can submit their application for the ChatDKG inception program to receive additional support from the OriginTrail team.
