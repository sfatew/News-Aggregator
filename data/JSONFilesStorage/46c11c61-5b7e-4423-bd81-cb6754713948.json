He/SheThey/It combined different technologies and ideas like cryptography, game theory, economics, and algorithms to achieve this breakthrough.When Bitcoin first emerged, people didn’t refer to its underlying ledger technology as “blockchain.” Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation allowed Bitcoin users to directly exchange digital currency without needing a centralised authority, like a bank, or a building society, or a checking account to verify transactions. This marked a significant advancement that earlier digital transaction systems hadn’t accomplished.What is the difference between Bitcoin & Blockchain?Blockchain is like a digital ledger that records transactions or information. It’s shared among many people, and once something is recorded, it’s hard to change.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a type of digital currency that uses blockchain technology. It’s one of the many things you can do with blockchain, like how email is one thing you can do with the internet. So, while Bitcoin uses blockchain, blockchain itself can be used for lots of other things besides Bitcoin.A bit more about Blockchain and how it works:A blockchain is helpful when many people need to agree on information. It’s often used in places where people don’t trust each other.People interact with the blockchain using their computers (called nodes). They help verify transactions and add them to the ledger, which is like a digital record book. This agreement process is called “consensus,” and there are different ways it can happen.Public blockchains are transparent, meaning anyone in the network can see what’s written in the ledger. This openness allows people to verify transactions and see their order, making the blockchain both decentralised and transparent.What does the future hold for Blockchain tech?The future of blockchain holds immense potential for transforming various industries and aspects of our lives. Here are some possibilities:If you ever used decentralised technology, safeguarding your online presence is paramount. Always ensure you are using a VPN. A quick why:If you enjoy my writing, please tune in next time where I will cover digital security and the use of a VPN in more detail.Thanks for reading :)","creation_date":null,"tags":["Blockchain","Blockchain Technology","Cryptocurrency","Web3","Technology"],"author":"Web 3.0 Educational Insights","category":null}
