They generally reward users who complete these tasks with digital assets.\nHowever, the Web3 landscape is disrupted by autonomous software, known as ‘bots,’ that mimic human actions and hijack rewards. Projects subject to bot intrusion suffer reputational damage and must spend additional resources to rid their systems of them. To establish sustainable and authentic interactions, marketing efforts need to be enhanced with anti-bot systems.\nAn AI-driven anti-bot model\nMidle, a Web3-powered marketing platform from the GAMI ecosystem, utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and a wide array of networks to integrate anti-bot technologies, ensuring genuine interactions. As a task-to-earn ecosystem, Midle presents innovative approaches to Web3 marketing by bringing together projects, users and influencers.\nUsers can collect points by completing tasks and get rewards, while brands increase user acquisition, retention and engagement by creating tasks and campaigns.\nMidle provides tools to ensure authenticity, streamline marketing efforts and target specific user demographics.

When projects share a post on their social media accounts, Midle’s system can automatically create tasks such as ‘retweet,’ ‘like,’ and ‘comment’ for the post.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.

It grants users the freedom to tailor their feeds and disseminate insights that are pertinent to the crypto community.”\n  Read more\nWith the user segmentation being developed by Midle, Web3 projects will be able to appeal to a more niche audience by creating campaigns that only target users can see. For example, a gaming project will be able to develop campaigns focused only on users interested in Web3 gaming.\nForging partnerships to strengthen Web3 campaigns\nMidle has partnered with Taiko Labs, which recently raised $37 million, to expand its ecosystem. The Web3 marketing platform launched a campaign of 500,000 Midle points for on-chain tasks after being integrated into the Taiko Katla testnet.\nBeyond the Taiko partnership, Midle has received grants from blockchain networks such as BNB Chain, Nibiru Chain, and Plena Finance. Nibiru-specific campaigns on Midle will begin with the launch of Nibiru Chain on the mainnet.\nMidle, which aims to achieve sustainable Web3 marketing, receives support from the ecosystem’s prominent names. Source: Midle\nCastrum Capital, a venture capital (VC) firm specializing in Web3 initiatives, has backed Midle’s fundraising efforts by acting as the initial investor and leading the funding round.\nWeb3 evolves to become structured\nApart from investments and grants, Midle announced that the platform will launch its utility token this year. Midle has also developed a proof-of-humanity feature that will work as an extra layer to make anti-bot campaigns safer.\n“The need for more corporate, measurable and sustainable platforms in the field of Web3 marketing is increasing day by day,” said the Midle team, adding, “In order not to be left out of the game, all Web3 companies have started to evolve into a more corporate structure.” Speaking hopefully about the future, they added:\n“Especially with the inclusion of ETFs and institutional investors in the ecosystem, we will start to see more professional and corporate projects and companies in all areas of Web3.”\nIn the Web3 environment, platforms such as Midle facilitate the transition of businesses to the decentralized ecosystem by offering automated marketing processes, in addition to combating common bot intervention problems. The evolution of such AI-equipped platforms will enable more measurable and sustainable marketing campaigns and will also be instrumental in the long-term success of Web3 initiatives.\nLearn more about Midle\n#Blockchain\n#Business\n#AI\n#Marketing\n#Web3\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.
