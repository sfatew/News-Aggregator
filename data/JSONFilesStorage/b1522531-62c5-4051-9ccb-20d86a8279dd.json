The core team behind it is the same as the Hubble Protocol.Marius Ciubotariu is the co-founder of Hubble and Project Lead of Kamino. With a degree in Business Economics, he worked in traditional finance (TradFi), as derivative product specialist and then as senior software engineer at Bloomberg LP, writing C++ and exploring Rust on the side as a hobby.Mark Hull is the core contributor of Kamino. He has a BSc in Business Administration and Management at the Manchester Metropolitan University. He,too, worked in TradFi in the service and project management at Credit Suisse for seven years and as Vice President at Swiss Re for eight years, before entering the crypto world as a contributor at Hubble Protocol.Currently (May 2024) no funds have been raised.Kamino Finance is addressing a variety of issues in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space on the Solana blockchain through its suite of products.These issues revolve primarily around the complexities and inefficiencies associated with liquidity management, leverage, and market speculation in a decentralized context.One of the primary challenges in the DeFi landscape is the complexity associated with managing liquidity. Liquidity is often fragmented even within the same protocol, leading to high slippage rates and less efficient markets. Traditional liquidity provision methods also expose providers to risks such as impermanent loss, where the value of deposited tokens changes compared to when they were deposited. This is particularly problematic in volatile markets.Additionally, managing liquidity positions requires constant monitoring and adjustment, which can be cumbersome and technically demanding. In traditional settings, liquidity providers (LPs) need to constantly monitor and adjust their positions to align with market conditions, often requiring sophisticated strategies to maximize returns and minimize risks.Another issue is the risk and complexity involved in leveraging investments in the DeFi space. Existing leverage options in DeFi can be complex and risky, often requiring users to engage with multiple protocols to achieve desired exposure. This increases transaction costs and operational risks, including the potential for liquidations in fast-moving markets.Moreover traditional DeFi platforms often utilize liquidity pools where capital is distributed across a wide range of prices, much of which may not be actively utilized. This setup leads to inefficiencies, as large amounts of capital are locked up without contributing to active trading, thereby reducing potential returns for liquidity providers.In environments with thin liquidity, trades of substantial size can significantly move prices, resulting in high slippage. This is especially problematic in volatile market conditions or for assets with lower trading volumes, deterring larger traders from participating.Furthermore many DeFi platforms specialize in either lending, trading, or liquidity provision, but few offer a seamless integration of these services. This fragmentation requires users to interact with multiple platforms, complicating the user experience and increasing transaction costs.Upon exploring the existing DeFi landscape, especially the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem, Marius recognized a gap in the market and a growth opportunity within Solana. Noting a lack of stablecoin options on Solana at the time, Marius decided to launch a project to create a stablecoin, which laid the groundwork for Hubble Protocol.The idea for Kamino developed from the need to support the DeFi ecosystem on Solana further, particularly around stablecoins and lending/borrowing frameworks. Kamino, aimed to build functionalities that would allow for capital efficiency and utility for stablecoins and other assets within the Solana network. This included creating optimized liquidity pools and lending markets that could support leveraged positions in a risk-aware manner.Kamino Finance is a DeFi protocol that seeks to amalgamate several financial functionalities (lending, liquidity provision and leveraged investment) within a single product suite.Initially, Kamino focused primarily on offering simplified solutions for liquidity providers to participate in yield-generating activities, especially through auto-compounding concentrated liquidity strategies. This approach is designed to optimize the process of earning returns from liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).As it evolved, Kamino expanded its services to include more complex features, currently (May 2024) such as:The integration of these services into a single protocol is intended to streamline user experience and potentially increase the efficiency of capital use within the DeFi ecosystem. Kamino places a significant emphasis on user experience, providing a platform that offers detailed analytics and performance data to help users manage and evaluate their investments more effectively.Kamino Lend (K-Lend) (Borrow/Lend section) system powers automated products like Multiply and Long/Short, and also functions as a standalone borrow/lend market.Traditionally, many lending platforms use multiple liquidity pools. Each pool is separate and holds different combinations of assets, with each pool having its own set of parameters and conditions. This setup can lead to fragmented liquidity, meaning that the money available to lend or borrow is spread thin across many pools, which can reduce the efficiency of the lending process.Kamino Lend’s approach is different. It uses a Unified Liquidity Market, which means it combines all the assets into a single pool. This centralization of resources has several benefits:This allows the Elevation Mode, an innovative feature within the Unified Liquidity Market for increased leverage while maintaining capital efficiency (introduced in Aave V3 as Efficiency Mode). This simplifies and enhances the borrowing experience:In the DeFi world, liquidity providers (LPs) play a crucial role by depositing their cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools. These pools are essential for enabling trading on decentralized exchanges without the need for traditional market makers. When you provide liquidity, you typically receive LP tokens that represent your share of the pool.Automated liquidity (Liquidity product) vaults were Kamino’s first product, launched in August 2022. Kamino liquidity vaults issue kTokens to depositors, which are yield-bearing LP tokens that are accepted as collateral in K-Lend.The growth of Uni V3 and concentrated liquidity as DeFi’s primary liquidity model has virtually stopped leveraged LPing in its tracks. This is because LP positions from CLMMs (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) are non-fungible, and cannot easily be used as collateral nor levered up.Kamino’s automated liquidity infrastructure tokenizes CLMM LP positions. These positions, called kTokens, are fungible, easily liquidatable SPL tokens.These kTokens form the basis of powerful DeFi strategies such as leveraged liquidity provision, or delta-neutral liquidity provision.When you deposit your LP tokens into Kamino Lend, called kTokens, these act as a proof of your deposit, much like a receipt, but they also continue to earn yield from the liquidity pool. This yield is auto-compounded, meaning it’s automatically reinvested to increase your earnings over time without any effort on your part.Kamino automates the entire LP process and optimizes capital efficiency & yields through:If you deposit into the mSOL-SOL vault on Kamino, you receive the kmSOL-SOL kToken and then deposit this kToken into Kamino Lend, to borrow SOL which can be redeposited into the mSOL-SOL vault, which means you mint more kmSOL-SOL tokens.As long as the liquidity vault yield remains higher than the borrow APY of SOL, your position earns positive Net APY.The innovation here is that kTokens can be used as collateral for borrowing other assets on the platform. This means you can unlock additional capital based on your initial investment without having to withdraw from the liquidity pool. Essentially, it allows liquidity providers to maintain their position and benefits in the pool, such as earning trading fees, while also being able to borrow funds for other uses.On K-Lend, you can opt to keep collateral assets from being borrowed by other users, thus protecting assets from any borrower default risks.Such assets, referred to as Protected Collateral, can still be used as collateral for borrowing by the depositor, but they do not earn interest on these assets. Protected collateral can be withdrawn at any time.Then the Multiply section is a one-click vault product that enables you to leverage your exposure to yield-bearing assets, by combining underlying K-Lend mechanisms like eMode and kToken collateral to offer powerful yield strategies.The core idea of Multiply is to enhance a user’s exposure to a chosen asset by using borrowed funds, thereby amplifying potential returns through leverage.Multiply operates by allowing users to open a leverage position against yield-bearing assets such as JitoSOL by borrowing SOL, the underlying asset. This process is facilitated by two primary features within the Kamino ecosystem: Elevation Mode (eMode) and flash loans. eMode enables users to achieve higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, which in practice means higher leverage.It basically uses the kToken lending strategy in a yield loop.(The risks associated with this method are primarily linked to liquidation scenarios. If the borrow rate exceeds the yield on the staked asset for a prolonged period, the increasing debt might reach a threshold that triggers liquidation)The project currently doesn’t have a defined roadmap (May 2024).Kamino has completed numerous external audits, currently (May 2024) 10 audits that can be reviewed on his GitHub.Continue the analysis by reading the Tokenomics on the App…Finish the analysis by reading the Conclusion on the App…Continue the analysis by discovering the FV Score on the App…Want to decide on the next crypto to be analyzed?
