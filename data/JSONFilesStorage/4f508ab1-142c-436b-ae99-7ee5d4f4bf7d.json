Central to these issues are malicious entities, including bots and bad actors, which erode the foundation of trust and security that Web3 endeavors to build.\nThe low participation problem is particularly pronounced in sectors beyond decentralized finance (DeFi), where projects focused on nonfungible token (NFT) infrastructure strive to carve out a niche. NFT infrastructure initiatives often grapple with lower engagement levels, underscoring a need for mechanisms that entice and reward users in impactful ways.\nBlockchain-agnostic XP systems\nAmid these challenges, experience point (XP) systems emerge as a promising avenue to boost user engagement across the Web3 landscape. However, for such systems to truly harness their potential and draw in a diverse user base, they must break free from the confines of blockchain dependency. By creating XP systems that are blockchain agnostic, projects can appeal to users from any blockchain protocol, widening their reach and impact.\nThe Itheum Protocol is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable data ownership and trade via Data NFTs, which aims to transform data management, ownership and exchange with security and transparency.\nThe Itheum ecosystem introduces a game-style XP system called BiTz, designed to enhance user engagement and differentiate legitimate users from bots or bad actors. Not bound to a single blockchain, the BiTz system integrates with Itheum’s omni-chain features, inviting users across various blockchains to participate and mint their data as Data NFTs.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nItheum hosts a blockchain-agnostic XP system powered by Data NFTs. Source: Itheum\nThe BiTz XP system encourages users to actively participate, rewarding them as they climb the platform’s monthly and all-time-high leaderboards based on their accumulation of BiTz, the smallest data XP unit within the Itheum Protocol.\nEngaging users with leaderboards and rewards\nLeaderboards foster competition and community among users. Top performers receive benefits like airdropped Data NFTs from past and future data creators, boosts on monthly Itheum Trailblazer quest rewards and future perks such as giveaways and merchandise.\nTo acquire BiTz, users must possess a BiTz-compatible Data NFT in their wallet, enabling them to participate in the “Get ” game. Initially, these Data NFTs were distributed to early supporters of the Itheum Protocol through airdrops. However, users who didn’t receive the airdrops can purchase BiTz-compatible Data NFTs on various NFT marketplaces.\nTo engage in the game, which is playable every 6 hours (reduced to 3 hours during the launch window), users are required to “burn” a meme as an offering to the BiTz Generator God. Whether users win BiTz is determined by chance following the meme sacrifice.\nBeyond playing the Get BiTz game, users will soon be able to earn BiTz points by engaging with the Itheum Protocol. Activities like exploring and marking favorites among Data NFTs and Data Creators via the Data DEX, utilizing Data Uptime Checks or embedding Data Widgets within the Itheum Explorer will earn users extra BiTz points.\nOffering an opportunity to influence BiTz utility and the development of the ecosystem, users are invited to contribute their insights through the suggestion form.\nThrough these initiatives, Cointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum seeks to resolve data ownership and trade challenges in the digital economy and aims to build a secure, inclusive environment for data exchange. The leaderboard system and associated rewards reflect Itheum’s commitment to valuing user contribution and interaction, emphasizing the platform’s dedication to enhancing data control and ownership in the digital age.\nFind out more about the Itheum Protocol\n#Blockchain\n#Decentralization\n#Adoption\n#Web3\n#NFT\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.
