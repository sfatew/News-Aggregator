The blockchain space is getting crowded and complex day by day, with no sign of cooling down, all the while gaining wider mainstream traction with each bullish trend.\nAs a matter of course, the growth of the blockchain ecosystem is accompanied by the constant emergence of new use cases. Blockchain’s full potential may be achieved when the technology is applied in varying fields, which highlights the urgent need for different blockchains to be interoperable.\nHowever, blockchains do not have the ability to work interoperable intrinsically. Lack of interoperability leads to uncertainties for businesses and users, discouraging them from interacting with blockchains and hindering the technologies’ adoption.\nLack of interoperability\nThe fragmentation in the space is a challenge for developers as well. A research shows that developing a basic blockchain application takes more than three months on average, and things get tougher when it comes to interoperable applications. There is not an established standard of systems and languages between technologies.\nMoreover, the novelty of the space means there are fewer experienced developers than in traditional industries, even though building a cross-chain application from scratch requires intensive knowledge of all chains included and powerful tools to support developers in their endeavors.\nAddressing these challenges is essential for blockchain to achieve its full potential as a game-changer technology and be adopted within mainstream industries. Omnichain solutions like Dojima target the aforementioned issues by employing a holistic approach to blockchain development.\nUniversal omnichain layer for all blockchains\nDojima is a cross-chain platform that unites numerous protocols with varying architecture and consensus mechanisms. It offers a universal layer where both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM chains like Bitcoin can interact.\nThe platform focuses on creating an omnichain hub on which all kinds of blockchains — proof-of-work or proof-of-stake — coexist and seamlessly integrate them for both developers and users. By pooling assets and data from different chains, Dojima simplifies the development and deployment of complex cross-chain applications.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

The developer dashboard, named Magic Dashboard, includes templates for building a wide range of products, such as Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and a deposit manager.\nDevelopment in minutes\nTo eliminate the need to start from scratch for developers, Dojima provides templates that reduce the time to build and deploy omnichain applications from months to less than 5 minutes. By lowering the technical knowledge barrier, the platform also offers a starting place for less tech-savvy developers.\nAn innovative business model, which Dojima calls Functionality-as-a-Service (FaaS), aids such users when developing and using DApp. It is an omnichain API service that interacts and gets data from all integrated chains. FaaS helps ecosystem participants with tasks varying from creating an account and signing transactions to setting gas rates.\nTo make navigation through connected chains easier, Dojima built an omnichain explorer. Just like traditional blockchain scanners, the service functions as a search engine and allows users to access and track transactions on the network.\nDojima offers an omnichain explorer for a holistic view of the blockchain space.\nThe protocol incorporates a cryptocurrency wallet as well. Designed to enable cross-chain interactions between integrated platforms, the Dojima wallet enables users to store, send, receive and swap tokens across different chains, including prominent blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\nDojima is also creating secondary marketplaces for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and derivatives in an effort to attract the users of connected blockchains. The project strives to be a robust, scalable and user-friendly platform that fosters liquidity, development and collaboration.\nBuilding a metaverse in a day\nDojima activated its testnet in late 2022 to let users and developers test the network, which coincided with hackathons organized by the team to attract talent in the space. One outstanding project was a metaverse created in less than a day, where users can buy multiple NFTs with tokens native to Dojima through a VR headset. Throughout 2023, the project expanded its community before jumping on the next step.\nDojima recently launched its stagenet - the alpha version of its mainnet - and temporarily opened up the faucet, a web-based service that sends test tokens to users for experimental use. The stagenet received interaction from more than one hundred unique wallets on its first day. Next for Dojima is the launch of its native token, which is slated for the third quarter.\n“Our vision is to be the cornerstone of the Web3 evolution,” Dojima says in its vision statement. The team aims to establish Dojima Network as “the go-to cross-chain platform that seamlessly connects diverse blockchain networks.”\n“By continually attracting top talent and leveraging support from industry leaders, we aim to revolutionize how developers, users and protocols interact and expand within the blockchain universe, making Dojima Network synonymous with innovation, collaboration, and growth in the Web3 space.”\nBy creating a marketplace for diverse blockchains, providing powerful tools and simplifying the building process, Dojima envisions a future where its solution becomes the standard for blockchain interoperability.\nLearn more about Dojima\n#Blockchain\n#Cryptocurrencies\n#Decentralization\n#Adoption\n#Cointelegraph Accelerator\nDisclaimer.
