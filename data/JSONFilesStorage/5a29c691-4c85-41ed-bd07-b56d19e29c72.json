It leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized environment. This makes it ideal for developers focused on building applications that benefit from blockchain’s inherent properties, such as immutability and security.In the context of task nodes, which are responsible for executing and managing specific tasks within a network, Spheron’s technology ensures efficient and secure task processing. These nodes are integral to maintaining the operational efficiency of DApps on the blockchain.A storage key in Spheron is a unique identifier or cryptographic key used for accessing and managing data within the platform. It plays a critical role in ensuring secure access to data, maintaining user privacy, and enabling interactions with smart contracts within the blockchain network.Ensure you have Koii Node installed.Step 1: Logging in1. Visit the Koii Node platform.If you don’t have it, you can download it at here.2. Enter your six-digit credentials to log in. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create one.Step 2: Navigating to Storage Key Section1. Once logged in, navigate to the Add Task dashboard.Step 3: Generating a Storage Key2. Click Get Key to automatically get the Spheron_Storage key.3. Follow the on-screen instructions. Select Spheron_Storage.Step 1: Accessing the Task NodeStep 2: Entering the Storage KeyStep 3: Stake the tokensStep 4: Run the task1.
