He says it’s the only human option.","title":"Doug Rushkoff Is Ready to Renounce the Digital Revolution","detailed_content":"THE MEDIA STUDIES building at Queens College is small and dark, with low ceilings and narrow corridors. It was built more than a century ago as a residential school for incorrigible boys, and a certain atmosphere of neglect remains. When I visit on a January weekday to see Douglas Rushkoff, who teaches here, he guides me around a stack of fallen ceiling tiles to his office in a back corner of the first floor. The Wi-Fi in the room is spotty, so he uses an Ethernet adapter to plug his laptop into the wall. The only evidence that we haven’t traveled back to the ’90s is that when it’s time for class, no students show up. Instead, Rushkoff opens his laptop and brings up a grid of faceless black boxes.","creation_date":"2023-05-11","tags":["","LONGREADS","BOOKS","DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF","MAGAZINE-31.09"],"author":"BY MALCOLM HARRIS","category":null}
