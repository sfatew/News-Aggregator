Since then, the daily figure fluctuated between 33% and 69%.\nHowever, industry pundits are also split on whether Runes will provide a sustainable revenue stream for Bitcoin miners, and there’s already a disparity between the numbers of Rune transactions and miner fees earned from Runes.\nThe new protocol, launched by Ordinals inventor Casey Rodarmor, has been marketed as a more efficient way to create new tokens on the Bitcoin network when compared to the BRC-20 token standard, an Ordinals-based method for creating Bitcoin-based tokens.\nRelated: Bitcoin fees crash after record daily average of $128 on halving day\nHowever, not everyone is happy with the amount of block space that has been taken up by Runes transactions in recent days.\nAmong those critics is Nikita Zhavoronkov, a lead developer at blockchain search engine Blockchair, who believes Bitcoin has “completely ceased” becoming a peer-to-peer electronic cash system — what its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, originally envisioned.\nSource: Nikita Zhavoronkov\nMagazine: Get Bitcoin or die tryin’: Why hip hop stars love crypto\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.
