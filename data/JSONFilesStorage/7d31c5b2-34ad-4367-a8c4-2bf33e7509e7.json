One way platforms achieve this is through points and ranking systems, which not only incentivize participation but also foster healthy competition among users. Today, let’s delve into these systems, exploring how they work and what they mean for you as a user.Points: Tracking Your ActivityPoints play a crucial role in monitoring your engagement within the platform. They serve as a measure of your activity, reflecting the actions you take, from buying NFTs to participating in community events. Additionally, they offer insights into your journey within the ecosystem, highlighting your contributions and interactions.Earning Points: A Rewarding ExperienceYou can earn points through various activities, each adding to your overall score. When you purchase NFTs, you receive 100 points, regardless of the transaction’s value. Moreover, there’s a bonus system called Bonus Per Buy, where you earn extra points based on your cumulative buy volume. The more you engage, the more points you accumulate, enriching your experience within the community.Leaderboard: Tracking Your ProgressThe leaderboard feature provides a snapshot of your performance compared to other users. With leaderboards updated every 5 minutes, you can see where you stand in terms of buy volume, number of buys, and accumulated points. Whether you’re aiming for short-term achievements or long-term recognition, the leaderboard offers valuable insights into your journey.Initial Users Points Lead: Acknowledging Early SupportersAs a token of appreciation for our early adopters, users who have interacted with Reame’s Dapp, including launchpad minting participants, receive a head start of 2500 points. This gesture aims to rekindle engagement and reward loyalty, recognizing the vital role early supporters play in shaping the community’s growth.Milestone Bar: Celebrating Collective ProgressOur milestone bar sets collective goals for the community, encouraging collaboration and shared achievements. As users collectively accumulate points, they contribute to reaching milestones set at 10 million, 50 million, and 100 million points claimed. It’s a journey we embark on together, celebrating each milestone as a testament to our collective effort and dedication.Join Us on the JourneyAt Reame, our points and ranking systems are designed with your experience in mind.
