Settlement Layer - The Settlement Layer is the base of the Cardano blockchain where all ADA transactions occur. It handles the transfer of ADA from one wallet to another and records transaction details.\n\n2. Consensus Layer - Above the settlement layer is the Consensus Layer, which is crucial for maintaining the security and robustness of the network. It employs the Ouroboros algorithm to achieve consensus on the state of the ledger.\n\n3. Networking Layer - The Networking Layer connects nodes in the network, facilitating the propagation of transactions and blocks. It ensures that data is distributed efficiently across the global Cardano network.\n\n4. Scripting Layer - The Scripting Layer sits at the top and supports smart contracts. It enables complex programmable transfers of value and allows the development of decentralized applications (DApps).","creation_date":"2024-05-13","tags":["#CardanoNativeTokens"],"author":"TapTools\n@TapTools","category":null}
