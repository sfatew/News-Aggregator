From visiting a historical ruin for the first time to randomly attending a local musician’s performance, the satisfying feeling of embracing the entire essence of what a touristic visit can offer keeps most of the travel industry operational and thriving.\nHowever, as the idea of a regional visit slowly turns into a plan and then into a calendar-filling endeavor, travelers soon realize that it’s way easier to dream about going to Nordic fjords than actually realizing the whole trip through scheduling, booking and transactions.\nDespite the decade-long digitization of the industry, travel systems are still operating at a surprisingly regional scale. Along with travel agencies, regional attractions and vendors like museums or event venues face limited market reach, often hindering them from marketing and selling their offerings to a global audience. Even when they score by selling tickets to a global customer group for a period of time, the lack of better customer insights makes it hard to reproduce the success.\nFor travelers, that translates to unnecessarily complicated booking processes that require ticketing from multiple apps and services. Furthermore, the potential risks associated with first-time visits beg for full traceability and transparency across the travel experience.\nNFT ticketing for the masses\nThe traditional “Web2” travel industry lacks a reliable solution to seamlessly integrate local offerings with global platforms, and blockchain is here to change that. VisitorApp, a blockchain-powered ticketing solution, showcases how Web3 can simplify regional travel for both travelers and industry participants.\nUsing Camino Network, the first blockchain designed for the needs of the travel industry, VisitorApp offers users a one-stop shop for discovering and purchasing local offerings directly from regional vendors. The VisitorApp team has spent four years to forge regional platforms and mobile apps for cities, regions and event organizers.\nVisitorApp simplifies regional ticketing for travelers and service providers using blockchain technology. Source: VisitorApp\nVisitorApp’s hybrid approach bridges Web2 to Web3 by allowing users to register and make purchases through fiat currency, tokens, blockchain wallets and conventional e-ticketing solutions. As part of its vision to bridge the Web2 experience with Web3 capabilities, VisitorApp is working on integrating crypto payments. Any purchased experience is presented with a nonfungible token (NFT) ticket — a digital collectible — through Camino Network. A relic of blockchain technology, these NFTs provide transparent and verifiable proof of purchase.\nDuring the Decode Travel hackathon in April 2024, VisitorApp’s application was used in practice. Event participants were able to mint their event tickets on Camino Network via VisitorApp, showcasing an active use case for travel tech developers.\nWhat is regional becomes global\nCamino Network is easily accessible by travel industry stakeholders, allowing any regional vendor to connect to a global hub. As users face a simplistic design on the front end with the application, blockchain technology enables seamless, secure, global communication in the background.\nVisitorApp is working on the integration with Camino Messenger, which will provide regional offers with direct access to the worldwide Camino Network, making regional attractions visible to a broader audience. The integration will be vital in connecting regional activities directly to the global travel market.\nCustomers can simultaneously purchase various offers from different vendors across different regions and store them in their mobile VisitorApp Wallet in their travel folder. The platform also supports white labeling, allowing destinations and regions to create their own ecosystem tailored to their specific needs.\nFostering trust through transparency and traceability\nCamino Network provides an efficient and community-driven environment that lowers costs, increases speed and ensures data transparency. As a result, every transaction on VisitorApp, whether it is a ticket purchase, tour booking or activity reservation, is authenticated and traceable. This transparency fosters a new level of trust between service providers and travelers.\nHighlighting the lack of improvements in the tourism market for tickets, tours and activities, especially in smaller and less professionally marketed destinations, Stefan Follmer, chief operating officer of VisitorApp, said:\n“With VisitorApp platform solutions, local offers can finally be made bookable in a simple, trustworthy and affordable way and presented to a global group of buyers via Camino Network.”\nVisitorApp scratches the surface of what can be achieved in the travel industry with a blockchain specifically designed to address the needs of travel businesses like regional tourism boards. Powered by Camino Network, the app offers a secure and reliable experience while creating personalized and memorable experiences for travelers worldwide.\nLearn more about VisitorApp and Camino Network\n#Blockchain\n#Travel\n#Business\n#Applications\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.
