This is our inaugural edition, and I would love to hear your feedback. What would you like to see in future updates? In this edition, I’ll cover some recent milestones, delve into our latest development updates, discuss some challenges we’re facing, and share our outlook for the future.I’m thrilled to announce that the Weather Challenge Staking has reached 100% completion! We are now gearing up for the Genesis Event, initially planned for May 13th, but now rescheduled to May 15th.We’ve also set up a brand-new Twitter account specifically for this initiative. Feel free to follow us here for real-time updates.Additionally, our Hold to Earn event has been the talk of the community. While it’s currently active, we may need to adjust the rewards based on its performance. This event has been a valuable learning experience, teaching us important lessons for future planning.As highlighted in yesterday’s article, the Hold to Earn event has been a mix of popularity and controversy. While I won’t rehash the specifics that didn’t go as planned, rest assured, we’ve learned valuable lessons from this experience.On the $RMV token front, we recognize the current market trends aren’t favorable. Our chart isn’t looking as strong as we’d like, and we’re actively working on strategies to improve this for potential future investors. However, it’s important to remember that we’re committed to thoughtful progress, not rushed solutions. The market determines the value of our project; our role is to enhance our offerings through targeted marketing, new listings, strategic collaborations, and engaging events like the Weather Challenge Genesis Mint.Feedback from our community indicates that Landlord GO is experiencing gameplay challenges. Though this game is managed by Reality Games and not directly by us, we are planning strategic initiatives with our sister company to enhance user acquisition and restore the engaging gameplay that appeals to a broad audience, not just a niche.In terms of overall development, we recognize that progress may seem slow. We are tackling many projects, and despite market noise and some delays, major development sprints are nearing completion. Our focus is steadfast: to build and innovate continuously. We are excited about the upcoming announcement of an AAA game, which we believe will elevate our project to new heights. I am profoundly grateful for our community’s loyalty and patience, understanding that achieving greatness takes time.As we near the completion of our current projects related to the marketplace and the Reality NFT portal, we are excited to share what lies ahead. Next week, I plan to unveil a detailed multi-year roadmap for the Reality Metaverse, but let me give you a sneak peek into one of our daring upcoming initiatives:$RMV Reduction: By reducing the circulating supply of $RMV, we aim to stabilize and potentially increase its value. The tokens removed from circulation will not only help fund further development and marketing but also adjust the balance of rewards across royalties, events, staking, and Genesis collections.Value Recompensation: Although $RMV will be deducted, stakers will receive monthly NFTs whose value exceeds the lost tokens. Additionally, stakers will earn $TRUMPET coins at a higher rate relative to their staked $RMV, along with other perks like potential spots on the Genesis whitelist.Example Staking Scenario: (Note: Actual figures may vary)Your initial investment of 10,000 $RMV could yield:If the staking took 6 months, you would end up with 6 x NFTs airdrops, 7000 of $RMV, and $TRUMPET at a very high APR + $RMV worth of 4500 in $TRUMPET coin.We believe this innovative approach will propel our ecosystem forward, but your feedback is crucial. Let me know your thoughts before this goes live — we value your input and want to ensure our community is on board with these bold moves.As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the utility of $RMV, we are introducing flexible and time-specific staking options. These options are designed not only to reward our community members but also to strategically manage the supply of $RMV over time. Here’s how it works:Stakers can choose from several fixed periods for locking in their $RMV:Each period offers a unique staking APR, which is set to decrease as more users participate. This tiered approach ensures that early stakers benefit from higher APRs, encouraging prompt participation. Here’s an illustrative example of how APRs will adjust based on $RMV price targets (note: actual APRs will differ, and do not worry, they will not be that high):Until $RMV reaches $0.04:Until $RMV reaches $0.07:Until $RMV reaches $0.10:This structured reduction in APRs is designed to align with our strategic goals of sustaining long-term value and demand for $RMV, by adjusting the rewards as the token appreciates. This approach not only helps in managing the economic model of $RMV but also provides clarity and predictability for our stakers.While a detailed article on Genesis NFTs is scheduled for tomorrow, I’d like to give you a brief preview today. Currently, these NFTs are significantly undervalued, and we are committed to elevating their floor price to much higher levels in the near future.Utilities of Genesis NFTs:Stay tuned for the comprehensive details in tomorrow’s article, and prepare for an exciting journey with Genesis NFTs!A quick snapshot of the upcoming Weather Challenge Genesis NFT:As we look to the future of the Reality Metaverse, our plans are not only ambitious but designed to significantly enhance user engagement and expand our ecosystem.
