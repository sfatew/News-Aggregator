At its core is Side Chain, a Bitcoin sidechain secured by BTC and serving as the settlement layer for rollups within the modular stack.Side Protocol seeks to introduce a modular stack to the Bitcoin ecosystem, enabling dApps to be deployed on Appups — application-specific rollups, akin to the deployment process in Web2 for apps spinning up their own servers.Within the Side Protocol, rollups operate on their own execution layer while leveraging the Side Chain, a Bitcoin sidechain, as the settlement layer. Appups will have the flexibility to select from various data availability layers to suit their specific requirements.Site | Docs | Discord | Telegram | X | GitHub | BlogBefore interacting with any project, please DYOR about the project:\n1) DYOR guide\n2) DYOR practicesRecommended: 4CPU, 8RAM, 250GB SSD Suitable servers:\n- Hetzner — CPX31\n- Cityhost — KVM-1001) Update the local package repository database & upgrade installed packages to their latest versions based on the updated package database:2) Install packages:3) Install Go:1) Clone repositoty:2) Move to side folder and checkout lates version:3) Install:4) Check commit:Output should be:\ncommit: abc51da52f8a612e2bbb25ca763b87815b0ba0605) Initialize your node:\nChange <NODE_NAME> for your node name.6) Download genesis file:7) Check genesis:Output should be:\nf5ca2aea92a89449f96b9837a027667409378583d7ca8a5bf6e49e4211b93184 /root/.side/config/genesis.json8) Check validator state:Should be at the beginning:if not at the beginning, reset chain:9) Download addrbook.json file:10) Customize client.toml file:11) Add minimum gas prices:12) Add external address:13) Add seeds and peers:14) Add max number of inbound/outbound peers:15) “Bad” peers filtration:16) Add prunning:17) Create service file:18) Reload daemon:19) Enable sided.service:20) Start sided.service:21) Check status:Wait for synchronization.22) Check sync status:23) Create wallet:\nChange <wallet_name> with Your wallet name.24) Go to faucet and claim tokens:\nhttps://testnet.side.one/faucetor visit Discord: https://discord.gg/sideprotocolChannel: testnet-faucet25) Check wallet balance:\nChange <wallet_name> with Your wallet name.26) Create validator:\nChange:\nMONIKER with the name of you validator;\nWALLET_NAME to what you’ve chosen in step 23.27) Delegate to your validator:\nChange:\n<valoper_address> with your wallet name.\n<wallet_name> with your wallet name.Claim rewards:Send transaction:Unjail:Check list of active validators:Check list of inactive validators:Follow for more guides on nodes, drops and other useful stuff.psi.crypto Discord: https://discord.gg/9kvtEQwtqJHackenDAO Discord: https://discord.gg/hackenX: https://twitter.com/the01100011Telegram: https://t.me/psicryptoFarcaster: @crptcpchk","creation_date":"2024-05-02","tags":["Bitcoin","Blockchain","Node","Validator","Side Protocol"],"author":"crptcpchk","category":null}
