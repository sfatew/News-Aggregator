Yesterday, there were sharp spikes in price on certain venues that impacted the price of USDP on pricing aggregators. Paxos does not control markets or trading activity on other trading venues.”\nThe depegging happened during a significant market cap increase for USDP, which briefly rose from a $140 million market cap to a $181 million market capitalization when the coin hit $1.29, according to CoinMarketCap.\nUSDP market capitalization, weekly chart.

Paxos offers APIs that offer 1:1 redemption 24/7. If venues choose not to implement these APIs or don’t want to make sure liquidity is supported, it is up to the user to determine the best approach for ordering.”\nPaxos’ USDP is currently the 13th-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nRelated: Bitcoin slips below $60K, but some traders aren’t turning bearish on BTC just yet\nTrader liquidated for $529,000 following depegging\nAn unknown trader was liquidated for $529,000 worth of Circle’s USD Coin\nUSDC\n$1.00\non April 16, shortly after Pax Dollar surged to $1.18, according to an April 17 X post by on-chain security firm PeckShield.\nTrader liquidation.

Particularly for stablecoins, users should make sure they use limit orders”\nPax Dollar has experienced significant price fluctuations on more than one occasion.
