BTC investor’s reply sparks curiosity","detailed_content":"The launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong on April 30 has opened new avenues for Asian traders.\nWhile the first week of trading for Hong Kong-based spot ETFs was lukewarm compared to their counterparts in the United States, Hong Kong’s proximity to China has made it a key point of discussion on whether the ETFs could be accessible to mainland China investors.\nRichard Byworth, managing partner at SyzCapital and BTC investor, has ignited rumors with recent comments suggesting that Bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong could soon be accessible to investors from mainland China.\nByworth, in his X response to Samson Mow, said that he heard talks that the spot BTC ETF could be added to Stock Connect.\nStock Connect allows qualified investors from one market to access eligible shares in another market with a set quota. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, a cross-border investment route, connects the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

The Stock Connect program covers a wide range of stocks but is subject to a daily quota.\nWhile Byworth words are mere rumors, China’s anti-crypto stance has made it a topic of discussion on social media.\nBrian HoonJong Paik, a co-founder and chief operating officer at SmashFi, also addressed the rumors about mainland China investors potentially accessing the Hong Kong ETFs in the near future. \nHe said that 70% of Chinese wealth is in real estate and that “there are now 100 million empty homes. The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] needs an alternative asset to mitigate social unrest.”\nRelated: Hong Kong officials recommend city’s crypto industry self-regulate\nIn another post, Paik listed several trade arrangements between Shanghai and Hong Kong markets that could allow Chinese investors to invest in spot BTC ETFs in Hong Kong.\nApart from the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme allows qualified Chinese institutional investors (such as banks, funds and insurance companies) to invest in overseas markets, including Hong Kong.\nAnother trade agreement — the mutual recognition of funds — between Hong Kong and mainland China allows eligible mainland and Hong Kong funds to be distributed in each other’s markets.\nChina banned Bitcoin mining and foreign crypto exchanges from offering their services to mainland customers in 2021. However, despite a blanket ban on crypto-related businesses and services, Chinese courts have deemed BTC legal property in several jurisdictions.\nWeb3 Gamer: Web3 gaming won’t exist in 5 years, $656K for best crypto game pitch\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.
