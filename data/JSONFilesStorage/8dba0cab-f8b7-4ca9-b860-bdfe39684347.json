FCA Executive Director Sheldon Mills said in a statement:\n“The new Digital Securities Sandbox reshapes how we regulate by allowing firms to test regulatory changes using real-world situations before these changes are made permanent. We hope this will be a more effective, collaborative and quicker way of delivering regulatory change.”\nThe initiative, which is to take place over five years, could pave the way for establishing permanent regulations governing the trading and settlement of digital assets down the line.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions.
