It’s a musical world of epic and dramatic proportions that blends electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements.\nZimmer has composed music for some of the biggest contemporary blockbusters, including Interstellar, Dune, The Dark Knight and Gladiator.\nBut what exactly does it take to compose an anthem for a living and evolving digital community? Cointelegraph talked to Sun about creating music with Zimmer that reflected the values of the Web3 space and received an exclusive quote from the composer about his vision.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3 HOURS AGO\nInnovative crypto exchange features debut at Token2049 in Dubai\nToken2049 Dubai saw innovative approaches to blend social media and trading, highlighting the evolution of crypto into a comprehensive social ecosystem.\nToken2049 Dubai hosted a dynamic gathering of more than 5,000 companies on April 18-19 at the iconic Madinat Jumeirah, showcasing the latest innovations in blockchain and crypto.\nAmong the prominent participants was Phemex, a global crypto derivatives exchange that actively engaged attendees with insightful sessions and discussions throughout the two-day event.\nPhemex’s Bulls & Bears pre-party, held at the SLS Hotel on April 17, set the stage for Token2049 with an evening of insights and celebration despite the unforeseen weather conditions. The event kicked off with a glamorous red carpet walk, followed by opening remarks from the Phemex founder.\nThe evening featured a range of activities, including expert insights from prominent figures, such as Cointelegraph CEO Yana Prikhodchenko, who shared her perspective on the growing trends in crypto media. A panel discussion featuring well-known crypto pioneers further explored cutting-edge topics in the industry.\nAt the event, Stella Chan, the chief operating officer of Phemex and co-founder of Pulse, proudly introduced the holders of the Phemex BlackCard.

Sun said that a joint endeavor of leveraging music as a “catalyst for communication and collaboration” was at the heart of the talks.\n“Hans’ unparalleled creativity and influence make him a natural ally in our quest to harness the power of music to not only showcase who we are but also to attract diverse talents and capabilities to the Web3 ecosystem.”\nRelated: Hollywood union deal with music giants guards against AI use\nSun said the overall mission was to help foster mutual understanding within the Web3 community, catalyze industry-wide collaboration, and propel the community toward an innovative future.\nMusic as a medium to showcase ideas, and represent themes or communities is one of the most accessible ways to bring in audiences.\n“Blockchain technology has unlocked a new frontier of digital collaboration, transcending geographical boundaries, time zones, languages and cultures,” Sun said. “In pursuit of these goals, we recognize the transformative power of music. It serves as a universal language capable of bridging gaps and fostering connection.”\nIn an exclusive quote for Cointelegraph, Zimmer described a sense of what Web3 can invoke and how we can even approach it:\n“Everything that the Western world certainly is built on is a legacy code of the Industrial Revolution. Our education systems are built around that, our government is built around that etc. And once the internet happened, I don’t think we really knew how to use it. I think we need to free ourselves from those philosophies and those restrictions.”\nThis is not the first instance of music being used as an instrument to unite communities and foster inclusivity in the Web3 space.\nIn the past, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been used as a form of micro-philanthropy to open up new funding avenues to classical musicians outside the limiting legacy institutions.\nWeb3 has also been able to bridge genres together through new musical collaborations through NFTs and metaverse performances, in addition to creating new means of connecting musicians to their communities.\nThe musical collaboration is yet another connection between the worlds of music and Web3 and points toward a more mainstream understanding of the importance of the emerging decentralized space.\nMagazine: Synthetix founder Kain Warwick: It’s DeFi that’s wrong, not the market\nExchange or buy TRX\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.
