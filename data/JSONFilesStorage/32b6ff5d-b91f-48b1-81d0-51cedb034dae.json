This question resonates deeply with many, shedding light on why Nigerians have turned to stablecoins for protection against inflation.Imagine being able to acquire a cryptocurrency that functions just like cash, retaining its value while remaining as transferable and tradable as any other digital currency. Exciting, isn’t it?The primary objective of stablecoins is to create a cryptocurrency that maintains a steady value, shielded from the volatility and price fluctuations often seen in other cryptocurrencies.In essence, stablecoins offer the convenience, privacy, and security of cryptocurrencies, while ensuring the trust and stability typically associated with fiat money.Fiat money, such as the naira, dollar, or euro, refers to government-issued currency commonly used in our daily transactions.While stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is on the rise, there are indeed several challenges hindering its widespread usage.In this essay, we will delve into the obstacles limiting the adoption of stablecoins in Nigeria and explore potential growth strategies. They are:According to CoinDesk, stablecoins represent a category of cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable and consistent value by being pegged to another asset class.These coins aim to mitigate price fluctuations by linking their value to that of another currency, commodity, or financial instrument.Moreover, they offer an alternative to the high volatility often associated with popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Typically, the issuer of a stablecoin establishes a “reserve” where it securely holds the asset or a combination of assets backing the stablecoin’s value.For instance, they might deposit $1 million in a traditional bank to support one million units of the stablecoin.This approach ensures that digital stablecoins are backed by tangible assets in the physical world, with the funds in the reserve serving as collateral for the stablecoin.Hence, when a stablecoin holder wishes to redeem their tokens, an equivalent amount of the underlying asset is withdrawn from the reserve.Examples of stablecoins include Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Dai (DAI), Paxos Standard (PAX), and Binance USD (BUSD).Despite this, there exists a more intricate type of stablecoin collateralized by instruments other than fiat currency, which will be explored in the subsequent paragraphs.To comprehend the workings of stablecoins, it’s essential to explore the foundational principles that ensure their stability. In this regard, the following are the basic mechanisms of stablecoins:Fiat-collateralized stablecoins derive their value from fiat currency, meaning each coin is backed by a specific denomination such as the U.S. dollar.Consequently, the fiat currency backing may vary, encompassing Euros, Gold, or other denominations depending on the country.Tether stands out as one of the leading companies issuing its USDT stablecoin through fiat collateralization.However, there have been rumors suggesting that they may not possess a dollar for every USDT they have minted. As a result, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies are under constant scrutiny by regulators.Nevertheless, according to Forbes, Tether maintains that it possesses sufficient reserves to back the $66.9 billion of Tether tokens in circulation. Also, the company has yet to default on any redemption request.Algorithmic stablecoins may or may not maintain reserve assets. Their main difference lies in the approach of stabilizing the stablecoin’s value by managing its supply through an algorithm.Essentially, a computer program operates on a preset formula to manipulate the coin supply, thereby adjusting its price.This process bears some resemblance to central banks, which also stabilize currency value without depending on reserve assets.However, unlike algorithm mechanisms, central banks possess the transparency of public monetary policy formulation, and the established status and credibility associated with being the issuer of legal tender.During a crisis, algorithmic stablecoin issuers cannot rely on certain advantages. For instance, on May 11, 2022, the price of Terra USD (UST) dropped by over 60%, causing it to lose its value as compared to the U.S. dollar.According to a Chainalysis report, stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is gaining momentum, with many residents turning to it as a hedge against inflation.The chart below depicts the progression of stablecoin received by Nigeria exchanges monthly.Also, Chainalysis suggests that a significant driver of this trend is the growing demand for an alternative store of value amongst Nigerians, as inflation rates on the continent have surged.In Nigeria, inflation soared to a 30-year high of 28.9% in December 2023, as reported by Trading Economics, largely attributed to the significant depreciation of the naira.While stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is on the rise, significant challenges impede its widespread usage, with government regulations emerging as a major hurdle.Government authorities have expressed concerns about the potential impact of stablecoins on currency sovereignty, regulatory compliance and monetary policy.Stablecoins, especially those pegged to fiat currencies, could potentially undermine a government’s control over its monetary policy.If stablecoins gain widespread acceptance, they could reduce the effectiveness of central bank policies aimed at managing inflation, interest rates, and overall economic stability.For instance, suppose a country’s central bank implements a policy to decrease interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending.However, if a widely used stablecoin, such as one pegged to the US dollar, becomes preferred by consumers and businesses for transactions and savings due to its stability, the effectiveness of the central bank’s interest rate policy may be diminished.As more people opt to hold their wealth in stablecoins rather than the domestic currency, the central bank may find it challenging to influence borrowing and spending behaviors through traditional monetary policy tools.This could lead to a disconnect between the central bank’s intended policy objectives and the actual economic outcomes, potentially increasing their efforts to hinder the widespread adoption of stablecoins.In the government move towards regulating stablecoin adoption, Nigeria announced in February that it is preparing to launch its cNGN stablecoin within its regulatory sandbox.The Central Bank of Nigeria also announced that the stablecoins will be pegged to the Nigerian Naira and backed by Naira reserves in selected commercial banks.This initiative represents a bold step in improving Nigeria’s financial system. However, the introduction of the cNGN comes with several potential challenges that could impact its successful implementation.Building public trust is essential for the success of the cNGN. Skepticism towards government-issued digital currencies may arise, especially if they are seen as tools for increased surveillance or control.Also, the cNGN being pegged to the Nigerian Naira and backed by Naira reserves in selected commercial banks, introduces risks tied to the financial health and stability of these institutions.Any instability within these banks could negatively affect the stablecoin’s value and reliability.Furthermore, Nigeria has faced significant inflation and currency devaluation issues in the past. If the cNGN is pegged to the Naira, it may not effectively serve as a hedge against these economic challenges, potentially reducing its appeal as a stable store of value.As we delve deeper into stablecoin adoption in Nigeria and the challenges hindering its widespread usage, it’s essential to examine these issues from multiple perspectives.Apart from the regulatory hurdles posed by government authorities, there are significant challenges faced from both the user and business perspectives. Let’s explore these challenges in detail:When considering stablecoins from a user perspective, the following are some of the challenges that may arise:i. Lack of confidence: While Nigeria has seen a notable adoption rate of stablecoins, some potential users may still hesitate due to uncertainties surrounding the stability of the coin’s value or the reliability of the issuing platform.These concerns often revolve around issues such as regulatory compliance, transparency of reserves, and the overall trustworthiness of the stablecoin issuer.ii. Barriers to entry: Leveraging stablecoins and their platforms may pose technical challenges for some individuals, particularly if acquiring or utilizing stablecoins entails navigating intricate procedures or platforms.Factors such as account verification processes, and technical proficiency requirements can impede user adoption.iii. Stability concerns: There have been significant concerns regarding the sustainability and transparency of reserves supporting stablecoins.Tether, for instance, has faced allegations of misleading investors about its stablecoin reserves.Although stablecoins are designed to maintain value stability, users worry about potential sudden fluctuations or deviations from their intended peg.Such perceived instability could discourage users from relying on stablecoins for their intended purpose, such as transactions or wealth preservation.When considering stablecoins from a business perspective, the following are some of the challenges that may arise:i. Regulatory and compliance issues: Businesses face complex regulations as the government aims to ensure compliance with legal frameworks.In the realm of stablecoins, for instance, companies must navigate a complex array of rules covering digital currencies, financial services, anti-money laundering (AML), and know your customer (KYC) requirements.Yet, adhering to these regulations can mean higher operating costs and legal risks, especially in jurisdictions where rules are unclear or frequently changed.ii. Integration with established or existing financial systems: Integrating stablecoins into the existing financial system poses technical, and institutional challenges for businesses.Traditional financial institutions may be hesitant to adopt or partner with stablecoin issuers, due to concerns about the potential impact on their existing business models.Building interoperability between stablecoins and traditional payment systems requires overcoming technical hurdles, and gaining trust from stakeholders in the financial industry.Encounter a random individual in Nigeria, and it’s highly probable they’ve transacted in Naira. Despite Naira’s limited purchasing power, many individuals still favor it over cryptocurrencies for various reasons.Primarily, certain individuals are skeptical about cryptocurrencies, due to concerns about their reliability and volatility. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, often experiencing significant value fluctuations within short time frames.Consequently, numerous Nigerians opt for the stability offered by fiat currency like Naira for their day-to-day transactions.However, compared to Naira, stablecoins present advantages surpassing mere stability. They boast seamless transferability and tradability.As a cryptocurrency trader, simply holding Naira doesn’t facilitate easy trading or interaction with cryptocurrencies.Hence, stablecoins offer the privacy, security, and interoperability characteristic of cryptocurrencies, coupled with the stability and trust associated with fiat money.Illustrating the significant importance of stablecoins for Nigerians, consider Julius’s experience.On January 1st, 2023, Julius purchased 100 Bitcoins, valued at 100 dollars each. This is equivalent to 1 Bitcoin equaling 1 dollar.By May 2024, the value of 1 Bitcoin had surged to 10,000 dollars. As a result, his initial 100 Bitcoins were now worth 1,000,000 dollars.The calculation is straightforward: multiplying 10,000 dollars by 100 Bitcoins. Therefore, Julius currently possesses 100 Bitcoins valued at 1,000,000 dollars.Now, Julius intends to acquire a car, with payment being in Naira, the accepted fiat currency in Nigeria. However, he is reluctant to deplete his entire trading proceeds.Consequently, he divides his Bitcoin holdings in half, resulting in 50 Bitcoins each. Subsequently, he sells 50 Bitcoins for 500,000 dollars. Then he converts it to Naira, valuing a whooping sum of 5,000,000.This leaves him with 50 Bitcoins, valued at 500,000 dollars. Realizing the volatility of Bitcoin, Julius, being a savvy trader, exchanges his 50 Bitcoins for 50 USDC stablecoins to preserve its value.Now, he can monitor the market and potentially repurchase Bitcoin with some USDC when its price and value decline.The story of Julius demonstrates how stablecoins can provide a safe haven for traders in volatile markets, offering a balance of stability and flexibility that is essential for managing both local and international transactions.Delving into the applications of stablecoins, we unveil the top use cases driving the transformative power of this cutting-edge financial technology. They include:A popular use case for stablecoins is providing liquidity for crypto traders.On exchanges, stablecoins can be one half of a trading pair, allowing traders to quickly move in and out of positions without exposing their portfolios to unwanted risks.As they await the next opportunity, stablecoins enable traders to maintain the value of their assets without having to convert them to fiat currency.According to Bitcoin Market Journal, as of February 2023, more than $24.5 billion was invested in the leading stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and DAI. Lending and staking are methods that provide funds to exchanges and institutions.Unlike Ethereum, which uses a Proof-of-Stake system, stablecoins like USDT and USDC do not.Staking these stablecoins is more like a high-interest savings account. However, the downside is that you can’t access or transfer your crypto during a specific lockup period.Essentially, you trade easy access to your funds for the potential of higher earnings. The significant amount of money in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) can be seen by looking at the total value locked (TVL) in these protocols.TVL represents the total amount of assets dedicated to lending and borrowing. Right now, the top three assets by TVL are stablecoins: USDT, USDC, and DAI.On-ramps are the platforms where you buy cryptocurrency, while off-ramps are where you convert crypto back to regular money (fiat).Stablecoins connect traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi), and make it easier to switch between the two.While you can use your fiat currency to buy any digital asset, stablecoins are widely supported because DeFi platforms and protocols are confident in their stability.Stablecoins can be used for sending money across borders and for remittances. They eliminate the need for third-party institutions, cutting down costs related to exchange rates and transfer fees.Transactions are verified on the blockchain, reducing processing times from days to minutes. Unlike other digital currencies, stablecoins minimize the risk of price volatility in remittances.To enhance stablecoin adoption in Nigeria, it is crucial to address the existing challenges effectively.Here are some strategies that, when implemented adequately, could facilitate the growth of stablecoin adoption in Nigeria:Stablecoin issuers should regularly publish audit results and detailed reserve information to assure users and businesses of their stability and backing.Furthermore, they should share success stories and case studies demonstrating how individuals and businesses in Nigeria have benefited from using stablecoins.Dialogues should be established among stablecoin issuers, blockchain associations, fintech companies, and Nigerian regulatory bodies such as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).This collaboration can help create clear and favorable regulatory frameworks.Stablecoin issuers can also collaborate with local banks to facilitate seamless conversion between fiat currencies and stablecoins, making on-ramps and off-ramps more accessible.Additionally, they could partner with mobile money operators to integrate stablecoins into existing mobile payment systems, leveraging the widespread use of mobile banking in Nigeria.Stablecoin issuers can facilitate user adoption by creating user-friendly platforms and applications, simplifying account setup, verification processes, and transaction procedures.Also, developing stablecoin solutions tailored to local needs, including interfaces in local languages and customer support services that incorporate local context could go a long way.Create forums, online groups, and local meetups to build a community around stablecoin use and adoption.Existing crypto communities can be leveraged as well to build a strong opinion around stablecoin adoption in Nigeria.Initiatives designed to educate the public about the benefits and uses of stablecoins should be launched, addressing common misconceptions and fears.Additionally, training programs for businesses on how to integrate stablecoins into their operations should be created, highlighting potential cost savings and efficiency improvements.In conclusion, while stablecoin adoption in Nigeria faces challenges, strategic approaches can drive its growth. Transparency in auditing, collaboration with regulators, and partnerships with local banks and mobile money operators are crucial.Improving user experience, fostering community engagement, and education initiatives can also accelerate adoption.By addressing these challenges with tailored solutions, stablecoins can realize their full potential in Nigeria’s financial ecosystem, offering stability and efficiency in digital transactions.~~If you found this interesting to read, please feel free to leave at least 50 claps \uD83D\uDE01 & a follow.For collaborations, features or promotion, reach out via email: (graciousjohn640@gmail.com).X: JohnGraceeyLinkedIn: Gracious John~~","creation_date":null,"tags":["Coins","Stable Coin","Cryptocurrency","Central Bank","Blockchain"],"author":"Gracious John","category":null}
