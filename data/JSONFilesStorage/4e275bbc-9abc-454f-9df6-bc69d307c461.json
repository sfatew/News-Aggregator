This time we’re partnering with KIP Protocol a project that boasts top-tier VC backing, founders with world-class academic credentials, and a clear vision for creating ‘the mission critical Web3 Base Layer for AI’.Incubated by Animoca Ventures (the VC arm of industry trendsetter Animoca Brands) and partnered with some massive industry players like OKX Wallet and Aethir, KIP Protocol is already well positioned to become a front-runner in the Web3 AI data arena. Already, their clients include respected institutions like Thailand’s Institute of Scientific and Technological Research and the National University of Singapore.What does all this mean for the Samurai family? Well, it means we will get the chance to purchase the licenses to run KIP Protocol Checker Nodes. These form the a crucial part of the infrastructure upon which the KIP ecosystem will flourish, and come with some juicy rewards as a result!We’ve managed to secure these nodes at an excellent price, and will be offering them through the Samurai Starter Launchpad on Monday, May 13.Read on to discover more reasons to be bullish on KIP Protocol, and find out exactly what you need to do to participate in the sale…Let’s cover the most important question first: what exactly are you buying when you participate in a node sale? Well, here’s the simplest answer possible: a node license is an NFT which allows you to generate passive income.If we want to get a little more complex: a node license is an NFT which gives you the right to run a Checker Node on the KIP Protocol network. This means a chance to generate passive income while at the same time ensuring the overall health of the KIP ecosystem.Checker Nodes do this by performing regular, automatic inspections of transaction data, service provider uptime, and all other activity flowing through the KIP network. As a reward for performing these checks, node operators will enjoy payouts comprising 20% of the entire $KIP token supply over the course of 3 years. Additional payments are also generated through network transaction fees, and bonuses which are paid out whenever your node detects improper activity on the network.These might sound like complex processes, but in practice operating a Checker Node is completely automatic. You can either run it on your own hardware using the dedicated KIP Protocol node client, run it on a VPS (Virtual Private Server), or just pass it off to a third-party NaaS (Node as a Service) provider who will handle the whole process for you. Shortly after the sale, we will provide a detailed guide on all three of these setup methods.Whatever you choose to do, you’ll be able to manage the whole process from KIP’s user-friendly dashboard where you can view your node’s metrics and claim your rewards. Your node license will also come with DAO voting rights, allowing you to participate in votes to settle disputes between entities on the platform (with even more rewards for doing so!).These node licenses will be non-transferrable for the first 6 months after TGE, after which they will be freely tradeable.Now that you understand what you’re buying when you participate in the KIP Checker Node sale on Samurai Starter, let’s take a closer look at the network which you’ll be contributing to.KIP Protocol is building a layer of foundational Web3 infrastructure where AI data providers, model providers, and application developers can securely transact.What might that look like in practice? Well, first a firm which builds complex AI models might list their products on the KIP Protocol network to easily monetize their work. Through the platform, these AI models can then be licensed by developers looking to build user-facing apps such as AI agents.In order to optimize these AI applications, developers also require large sets of data to train the models on specific tasks — these they can also access via feeds from the various data providers integrated with the KIP Protocol network. In essence, it’s a next-gen Web3 framework where all of the players in the AI industry can seamlessly and securely transact with one another.KIP Protocol handles the interchange of data, transfer of funds, and records of data ownership for all of these processes.It’s a win-win for everyone involved: application builders get quick and reliable access to the models and data they need, while the providers of these models and data can easily monetise their work through the power of Web3. The latter simply deploy their creations onto the network as ‘Knowledge Assets’ and receive revenues directly to their wallet whenever these assets are utilized.And throughout the entire process, each entity retains intellectual property over their creations, and full control over how their data is licensed. This is achieved through the use of NFTs (ERC 3525 standard), which are minted to represent the Knowledge Assets deployed onto the network, as an immutable proof of ownership.In order to do this, Knowledge Asset creators must also must lock a certain amount of $KIP tokens, which act as collateral to ensure they will properly fulfill their obligations while operating on the network.This is where the Checker Nodes come in. Their job is to periodically ping the API endpoint of these AI suppliers and service providers to check three crucial things:If the node detects irregularities with any of the above, it passes the problem on to other nodes to be double-checked. If the nodes achieve a consensus, then the $KIP tokens staked by the asset provider are slashed as punishment (with the seized funds going directly to the node operators who uncovered the discrepancy).This ensures the clients transacting on the KIP Protocol network can trust the credibility and quality of the suppliers they’re interacting with, while incentivizing suppliers to ensure their feeds are accurate and consistent. If any further disputes arise between clients and service providers on the network, it’s the node operators who step in to settle the matter.Each node license comes with DAO voting rights which can be used to vote on the outcome of these disputes, with bonus rewards being paid out for participation. This is a completely optional (but potentially lucrative) aspect of running a KIP Checker Node.A high level of decentralization is essential to ensuring that this system operates effectively, with no one point of failure. In order to achieve this, a maximum of 50,000 of these nodes will be issued.For a more detailed breakdown on the specific tasks each of these nodes is entrusted with, see here.Now onto the part that everybody’s most interested in: the $KIP token rewards. These tokens are paid out as passive income to node operators for running a Checker Node and contributing to the health of the network. Node operator rewards come from various sources:There is no cliff attached to these rewards — $KIP rewards will begin being generated 7 days after TGE, and paid out to operators every 15 minutes. You’ll be able to claim your rewards whenever you want, with a 30-day cooldown after each withdrawal.All of this is managed from the KIP node operator dashboard. Here you’ll be able to view all of the checks your node has performed over the past 24 hours, the rewards received from each individual income source, and the total amount you’ve yet to claim.Important Note: KYC is not required to participate in the node license sale, however it will be required in order to claim node operator rewards. This makes residents of the United States, Cuba, Iran, Syria, and other jurisdictions ineligible to claim rewards.The KIP team is made up of respected academics in the field of AI research, alongside seasoned Web3 industry professionals. They’re fully doxxed, with demonstrable track records of working with top-tier clients in government and industry. Their combined expertise led KIP Protocol to a gold-medal finish in the 2023 Chainlink Hackathon, against a pool of 18,500 other competitors!In addition, the KIP family extends to include a host of top-tier VC investors, over 200 KOLs, and clients including respected tech and education institutions. Take a look at the depth and breath of the extended KIP network already!Several top industry players have already begun integrating KIP Protocol with their tech. For example, Animoca’s Open Campus — the worldwide Web3 education hub launched by Animoca Brands — is using KIP Protocol to create AI-driven applications and revenue streams to power their platform.KIP Protocol has some big plans for the future. For an overview of everything they have lined up, take a look at the roadmap graphic below.Here’s a few brief details on some of our top highlights:The $KIP token will be used throughout the KIP Protocol network, powering everything from transactions to Knowledge Asset deployment. Its utilities within the network include:The total supply of $KIP will be 10,000,000,000 tokens, with an initial circulating supply of 526,000,000. TGE is set to follow later in Q2, and Checker Node rewards will begin being paid out just one week afterwards.These rewards will be drawn from the Ecosystem Fund, with 20% of supply set aside for node operators, to be released throughout the first three years of the project. For the rest of the distribution breakdown, see below:KIP Protocol plans to list the $KIP token on several top-tier exchanges (and given the strength of their backing, we foresee these being truly top-tier). More details on these will follow in the coming months!The launch price and final launch FDV will depend on several factors, including the total number of Checker Nodes sold.So what precisely do you need to do to get in on this action? The short answer: get yourself over to the Samurai Starter launchpad at 11:00 UTC on Monday, May 13. Here’s all of the important information you’ll need:As you can see, we’ve secured 200 KIP Checker Node licenses for our community, at a special discounted price of $620 each!These nodes will be offered up in a two-round sale with the first round lasting 12 hours followed by a FCFS second round lasting an additional 24 hours or while supplies last.
