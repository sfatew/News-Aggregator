This is the future and I think it takes someone like me who comes from a business background who’s intimately involved in the blockchain.”\nPublic trust in the election processes and political parties has taken a significant hit in recent years. In 2023, only 12% of the public in the United Kingdom said they trusted political parties, down from 20% in 2022, according to a report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published in March 2024.\nLevels of trust in public institutions in the U.K. in 2023.

So we want to put voting on the blockchain.”\nBeyond introducing an on-chain voting system, Rose also aims to make London more crypto innovation-friendly to restore its status as a leading global financial center. He said:\n“[London] is not pro-crypto, whereas it used to be the greatest financial center in the world.”\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nBrian Rose, interview with Cointelegraph.

But the only way to do it is to do it now with blockchain […] I also want to create the London coin and get it into the hands of every man, woman and child in this city to finally create a system for financial education.”\nWhile the details of the London token are still being finalized, Rose said that it will function as a regular cryptocurrency with price fluctuations and that it could be launched on the Polygon or Avalanche blockchains.\nRose plans to offer day-to-day utilities for the London crypto, including staking, payment of public transport, taxes and other public services.\nRelated: Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether ETFs officially approved to start trading on April 30\nFinancial institutions would pay a 1% financial education tax for London coin\nThe independent mayoral candidate is planning to issue the London token to around 10 million people living in the Greater London area to incentivize users to learn about the intricacies of blockchain and crypto.\nTo subsidize the costs, large financial institutions headquartered in London would be required to pay a 1% tax:\n“We’re going to give a 1% one-off financial education tax to any institution that has a global headquarters here behind me in the city of London that will be a liquidity pool that gets injected into The London coin.”\nRose said he invested over $10 million into 40 different Web3 companies, which is part of the reason he is so confident about the potential of blockchain technology.\nRelated: Bitcoin outperforms Tesla stock for the first time since 2019\nExchange or buy TWT\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.
